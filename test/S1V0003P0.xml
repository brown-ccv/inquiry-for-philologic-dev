<p id="S1V0003P0-00678">This day, at three o'clock, his Majesty came down in state to the House of Peers and opened the session of parliament. His Majesty being seated upon the throne in his royal robes, Mr. Quarme, the deputy usher of the black rod, was sent to the commons to demand the immediate attendance of that house. The speaker, accompanied by several members, forthwith appeared at the bar, when his Majesty was pleased to deliver the following most gracious speech:</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00679">"My Lords and Gentlemen,</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00680">"Since the end of the last session, the preparations of the enemy for the invasion of this kingdom have been continued with incessant activity; but no attempt has been made to carry their repeated menaces into effect.&#x2014;The skill and intrepidity of my Navy, the respectable and formidable state of my Army and Militia, the unabated zeal and improved discipline of a numerous Volunteer Force, and the general ardour manifested by all classes of my subjects, have indeed been sufficient to deter them from so presumptuous and desperate an enterprise. While this spirit continues to animate the country, and its voluntary exertions for its own defence subsist in their full vigour, we need not fear the consequences of the most powerful efforts on the part of the enemy. But let us never forget, that our security has arisen from the resolution with which we have met and provided against the danger, and that it can be preserved only by steady
<col>2</col>
perseverance and unremitting activity.&#x2014; The conduct of the court of Spain, evidently under the predominant influence and control of France, compelled me to take prompt and decisive measures to guard against the effects of hostility. I have, at the same time, endeavoured, as long as it was possible, to prevent the necessity of a rupture; but, in consequence of the refusal of a satisfactory explanation, my minister quitted Madrid, and war has since been declared by Spain against this country.&#x2014;I have directed a copy of the manifesto which I have caused to be prepared on this occasion, to be laid before you, together with such papers as are necessary to explain the discussions which have taken place between me and the court of Madrid. You will, I trust, be convinced by them that my forbearance has been carried to the utmost extent which the interests of my dominions would admit; and while I lament the situation of Spain, involved in hostilities contrary to its true interests, I rely with confidence on your vigorous support in a contest which can be attributed only to the unfortunate prevalence of French councils.&#x2014;The general conduct of the French government on the continent of Europe has been marked by the utmost violence and outrage, and has shewn a wanton defiance of the rights of neutral territories, of the acknowledged privileges of accredited ministers, and of the established principles of the law of nations.&#x2014;Notwithstanding these transactions, so repugnant to every sentiment of moderation and justice, I have recently received a communication from the French
<image src="S1V0003P0I0016"/>
<col>3</col>
government, containing professions of a pacific disposition. &#x2014; I have, in consequence, expressed my earnest desire,, to embrace the first opportunity of restoring *he blessings of peace on such grounds as may be consistent with the permanent safety and interests of my dominions; but I am confident you will agree with me, that those objects are closely connected with the general security of Europe. I have therefore not thought it right to enter into any more particular explanation, without previous communication with those powers on the continent with whom I am engaged in confidential intercourse and connection, with a view to that important object, and especially with the emperor of Russia, who has given the strongest proofs of the wise and dignified sentiment, by which he is animated, and of the warm interest he takes in the safety and independence of Europe.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00681">"Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00682">"I have directed the estimates for the public service to be laid before you. I regret the necessity of any additional burdens being imposed on my people; but I am sure you will be sensible how much their future safety and happiness depend on the vigour of our exertions, and that in the mode of raising the supplies, you will continue to shew your anxiety for the support of public credit, and for restraining, as much as possible, the accumulation of the national debt.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00683">"My Lords and Gentlemen,</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00684">"In considering the great efforts and sacrifices which the nature of the contest requires, it is a peculiar satisfaction to me to observe the many proofs of the internal wealth and prosperity of the country. It will, I am sure, be your great object to maintain and improve these advantages, and at the same time to take all such measures as, by enabling me to prosecute the war with vigour, may afford the best prospect of bringing it to a safe and honourable termination."</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00685">After his Majesty had left the house, lord viscount Sidmouth, late the right hon. Henry Addington, was introduced with; the accustomed formalities, sworn, and took his seat. His lordship's supporters were viscounts Wentworth and Sydney.&#x2014; Lord St. Asaph, son of the earl of Ashburnhum, lately called up to the house by that title, was also introduced with the usual forms, and supported by lords Rivers and Walsmgliam.&#x2014;Lord Caledon, one of
<col>4</col>
the newly elected, Irish representative peers, took the oaths and his seat. After a short interval, the Lord Chancellor read a copy of his Majesty's, speech to both houses, and which was, as usual, afterwards read by the clerk at the table.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00686"><member>Lord Eliot</member><membercontribution> then rose for the purpose of moving an address to his Majesty, on his most gracious speech from the throne, and spoke as follows:&#x2014;My Lords, it is not my wish to trouble your lordships at any great length in moving, as I shall have the honour to do, an humble address to his Majesty, in answer to the gracious communications his Majesty has just condescended to make to this house; but I think it necessary shortly to state the grounds on which I intend to found my motion for that address. The contest in which we are and which forms a Majesty's speech, is, the fate war, so closely connected with the cause of royalty, and so intimately interwoven with the essential interests of the country, that in adverting to the measures for supporting it, it seems to me, my lords, that the only question is, whether the address which I shall have the honour to move, be conformable to the usual practice of this house. I hope, in this point of view, it will not be considered as informal, and that it will receive the approbation of your lordships. The first point in his Majesty's speech is one on which, I am convinced, there can be but one opinion. That no invasion of this country has yet been attempted, notwithstanding the boast and menaces of the enemy, made even at the commencement of hostilities, is a subject which cannot fail to be gratifying to every person throughout the kingdom. Although it is true, that no apprehension need be entertained as to the event of an invasion, and convinced as I am, that no fear has been felt by the people as to the result of such an attempt, yet it ought not to be forgotten, that a desperate attempt at invasion made by a desperate enemy, would be productive of the most disastrous consequences. Notwithstanding the high state of preparation, however, in which our enemy has long been; notwithstanding it is a fact that, according to his own accounts, his armament for the purpose of invasion has long since been completed; notwithstanding the great display of ships and of forces on the opposite shore, our gasconading foe has never yet attempted to put his threat into execution. It must,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0017"/>
<col>5</col>
therefore, be a subject for just pride to your lordship?, and the country at large, that the enemy has been deterred from making the threatened attempt, by the vigour and decision displayed on our part, by the excellent arrangement and disposition of our forces, and by the admirable skill and judgment displayed in all our operations, both for home defence, and for the annoyance of the enemy; by which means he has not only been prevented from making the attempt, of the success of which he has so much boasted, but has been made to tremble in his turn for the safety of his own shores. It is not to any change in his purpose, but to our own energy und vigour that we are indebted for our safety. These advantages we owe to the excellent measures adopted for our defence, to the skill and gallantry of our officers and seamen, to the courage and admirable discipline of our army and militia, and to the patriotism and valour of another description of force unknown to former times, but which has been reserved to grace and adorn the present age. Formerly we relied upon the bravery and discipline of a regular army, and often had occasion to admire and congratulate their splendid achievements. Now, in addition to that great and essential support, another description of force has arisen in the persons of our brave and patriotic volunteers; who, actuated by the most fervid patriotism, have arranged themselves under the military banners of the country, for its defence against the attempts of a desperate enemy. A description of force this, which, whilst it is actuated by the most determined valour, far exceeds, in point of numbers, any former force of which this country could boast, and every previous calculation which could be formed as to its expected amount.&#x2014; With regard to the war with Spain, my lords, I shall not now enlarge upon that subject, because we have not yet before us those documents and facts which can alone enable us to form a correct judgment as to the different bearings of the question. When, by the possession of those documents and facts, we are enabled to judge of the measures and conduct of his Majesty's ministers, then, of course, will be the time to go into the question m detail. It will not, however, he venturing to say too much in expressing my opinion, that the facts respecting the conduct of Spain which are already known, completely bear out 1iie conduct of ministers. Hostilities with
<col>6</col>
Spain were not, in my mind, so much a, question of justice as of policy; and when we consider the supplies sent by Spain to France, which contributed to enable the latter, to carry on war against this country, I cannot but think that no other course remained for his Majesty's ministers to pursue, than that which they have adopted; and their conduct appears to me so clearly entitled to confidence, that I think there can be no hesitation in agreeing to this part of the address.&#x2014;With respect, my lords, to the other point in his Majesty' speech, namely, the communication from the French government, containing professions of a pacific disposition, I presume to think there can be but one opinion on the subject, and that that opinion must be to the effect contained in his Majesty's speech. The general conduct of the French govt. affords little hope of any sincere desire on its part for peace. The language of that govt. is now, however, very different from (that which it used at the commencement of the war, when it was boasted that England single-handed could not contend with France. That boast has now been given up, and an anxious desire for peace, has been substituted in its stead. I cannot pretend to explain the views with which these overtures have been made. The enemy may have various motives. He may hope to embarrass the govt. to create divisions in parliament, or discontent in the country, by exciting too eager a desire for peace. But, whatever his motives may be, your lordships must be convinced, that it is only by firmness and unanimity that a solid arid lasting peace can be. attained.&#x2014; There only remains, my lords, one other topic for me to notice; namely, the flourishing state of our commerce. Upon this subject it is needless for me to enlarge, as it must be obvious to every one who bestows upon it the slightest portion of observation. These, my lords, are the grounds upon which I venture to offer an address to your lordship's notice, and which, I trust, will meet with your cordial approbation. His lordship concluded with moving an address to his Majesty, of which the following is a correct copy:&#x2014;"Most gracious sovereign, we, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the lords spiritual and temporal, in parliament assembled, humbly beg leave to return your majesty our unfeigned thanks for your most gracious speech from the throne.&#x2014;We beg leave to assure your Majesty, that this
<image src="S1V0003P0I0018"/>
<col>7</col>
house reflects with the greatest pride and satisfaction, that the skill and intrepidity of your Majesty's Navy, the respectable and formidable state of your Army and Militia, the unabated zeal and improved discipline of a numerous Volunteer Force, and the general ardour manifested by all classes of your Majesty's subjects, have, notwithstanding the incessant preparations for the invasion of this kingdom, been sufficient to deter the enemy from so presumptuous and desperate an enterprize. We fully concur and participate in your Majesty's sentiments, that while this spirit continues to animate the country, and its voluntary exertions for its own defence subsist in their full vigour, we need not fear the consequences of the most powerful efforts on the part of the enemy: and we in treat your Majesty to be assured that we shall never forget that our security has arisen from the resolution with which we have met and provided against the danger, and that it can be preserved only by steady perseverance and unremitting activity.&#x2014;We request your Majesty to accept our warmest acknowledgments for the communication which your Majesty has been pleased to make to us, relative to the War which Spain has declared against this country; and we entreat your Majesty to allow us to express the just sense we entertain of your Majesty's gracious condescension in having directed a copy of the Manifesto which your Majesty has caused to be prepared on this occasion to be laid before us, together with such papers as are necessary to explain the discussions which have taken place between your Majesty and the court of Madrid, and to assure your Majesty that we shall take them into our immediate and serious consideration, with the full resolution of adopting all such measures as are necessary to maintain the honour and dignity of your Majesty's crown. and the security and interests of your dominions.&#x2014;We entreat your Majesty to be persuaded, that it is impossible for us not to observe in common with all Europe, that the general conduct of the. French govt. on the continent has been marked by the utmost violence and outrage, and has shewn a wanton defiance of the rights of neutral territories, of the acknowledged privileges of accredited ministers, and of the established principles of the law of nations.&#x2014;We return your Majesty our most grateful thanks for informing us, that notwithstanding these transactions, so repugnant to
<col>8</col>
every sentiment of moderation and justice, your Majesty has recently received a communication from the French govt. containing professions of a pacific disposition; and we humbly request your Majesty to be assured, that we are thoroughly persuaded of your Majesty's earnest wish to embrace the first opportunity of restoring the blessings of peace on such grounds as may be consistent with the permanent safety and interest of your dominions: we at the same time on our part, beg leave to be allowed to declare our entire concurrence in opinion with your Majesty, that those objects are closely connected with the general security of Europe.&#x2014;We therefore rejoice to learn that your Majesty is engaged in confidential intercourse and connection with foreign powers with a view to that important object, and especially with the Emperor of Russia, who has given the strongest proof of the wise and dignified sentiments by which he is animated, and of the warm interest which he takes in the safety and independence of Europe, and we are fully satisfied of the propriety and wisdom of your Majesty's determination in declining to enter into any more particular explanations without a previous communication with those powers.&#x2014;We beg leave, with every sentiment of respect and dutiful attachment to your Majesty, to testify our most grateful sense of your Majesty's uniform regard for the welfare of your people, and to assure your Majesty, that, in considering the great efforts and sacrifices which the nature of the contest requires, we most cordially participate with your Majesty in the satisfaction which your Majesty derives from the many proofs of the internal wealth and prosperity of the country; and your Majesty may depend upon our constant and animated endeavours to maintain and improve these advantages, and at the same time to take all such measures, as, by enabling your Majesty to prosecute the war with vigour, may afford the best prospect e of bringing it to a sale and honourable termination."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00687"><member>Lord Gwydir</member><membercontribution> rose to second the address, and spoke as follows:&#x2014;My lords; after the most gracious speech we have this day heard delivered from the throne, and the extensive view which the noble lord has just taken of the address he has proposed, it will be unnecessary for me to trouble you with a long discussion of the subject under debate. But, as an Englishman, it
<image src="S1V0003P0I0019"/>
<col>9</col>
is impossible not to view with exultation and confidence the exalted situation which this country at present enjoys.&#x2014;Secure at home, and respected abroad, we may hear with tranquillity those vain-glorious boastings of our enemy, which in no single instance have been carried into effect: contented with a display of vessels and troops, he has not dared even to attempt the expedition he has so loudly proclaimed. His fleets and his flotilla have constantly remained under the protecting cannon of his own shores.&#x2014;The long continuation of peace with Spain has been matter of much greater surprise to the public, than the declaration of war we have so lately heard. The declaration was reduced to a mere question of prudence: and our having so long abstained from that declaration, affords a strong presumption of our pacific disposition. Supplies in money, unauthorized by treaty, had been requested by Trance, and granted by Spain. Nor were they likely to be refused; her counsels and her riches, her Sleets and her armies had long, been subject to French despotism. Nor could peace with Spain continue for a moment after the interest's of France demanded war. Fresh engagements were entered into by France and Spain, and all explanation to us of the nature of, those engagements utterly refused.&#x2014;In this state of things, were we quietly to wait the convenience of France and Spain? Were we to conduct the contest in the mode best suited to their wishes? Were we to become the willing dupes of fallacious promises, and by forbearance, almost assist in supplying-Spanish wealth for the payment of those armies, which within sight of our coasts were threatening our ruin? Or were we, by a manly and decisive conduct, to strike at the root of the evil, and anticipate the open hostility of Spain, by seizing those treasures which the French had put in requisition with the view of employing them for our destruction? Self-preservation seemed to demand the conduct which has been followed: and I have little doubt, that when the papers and documents are laid on your table, your lordships and the public will applaud the measure from a conviction of its justice.&#x2014;With respect to the communications lately sent from France, it would be a waste of your lordships' time, were I to enter at large on a proposal the precise terms and extent of which are not made known to the house. But thus much at least we may decide:
<col>10</col>
that whatever may be the change of disposition which it may profess, our preparations and exertions should experience no relaxation. I would at this moment neither raise nor depress the hope of such a peace as the interest and humanity of this country equally demand; but peace to be a blessing must bring with it a moral and well-founded assurance of lasting and mutual benefit; not that false and hollow security which at best can tend only to feverish repose; peace in words, malignant hostility in actions.&#x2014;In the conduct we adopt, we must not forget the lessons so recently taught by painful experience. It may neither be improper nor irrelevant to look back a little to the period of the last peace. From the concessions their made, and the eagerness shewn by this country, the first consul concluded, we were a vanquished nation; his conduct was in conformity to his opinion; insult was added to injury: and at the moment to which I allude, we had only to choose between instant hostilities, and lasting degradation. The nation felt, as I trust it always will feel, whenever its honour and dearest interests are attacked: so outraged and insulted, it preferred danger to disgrace, and unanimously approved of the renewal of the war.&#x2014;The first consul, who had proposed peace only as a more efficacious and secure mode of carrying on the contest, who. knew he should obtain by concession what he had no hope of gaining by force, was not prepared for so early or so vigorous an exertion: his rage and disappointment should not be forgotten.&#x2014;If we are now to presume that honourable and permanent peace is the real object of the recent communication from France, great and sudden must have been the change of disposition in the government of that country. It is unnecessary to state the events of the last few months which call for this observation. They are too deeply engraved on the recollections of your lordships to need any fresh detail. We may hope for peace, but we must prepare for war: if the necessary exertions and privations are beyond all former precedent, the object for which we have to contend is above all value. In this sentiment I trust we shall all' agree, that no sacrifices are too severe, no efforts too great or too powerful, to support and secure the honour, dignity, and true interests of the nation. Strongly and deeply impressed with these sentiments, I have presumed to support the address
<image src="S1V0003P0I0020"/>
<col>11</col>
which has been proposed. I have now only to return your lordships my most humble and sincere thanks for the indulgence and attention I have had the honour to receive.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00688"><member>The Earl of Carlisle.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;I do not rise, my lords, to disturb that unanimity by which I am aware it is so much to be wished the house should be actuated on a subject of so much importance as the present. When I heard his Majesty's most gracious speech read, so cordially did I agree in every sentiment expressed in it, that I did not think it would have been necessary for me to say a single word on the subject. Some observations, however, which have fallen from the two noble lords who moved and seconded the address, seem to require some explanation. I, for one, am anxious to enter my protest against the supposition, that in agreeing to the address as proposed, I thereby pledge myself on a subject as to which the house is not in possession of the facts necessary to enable them to form a judgment. I allude, my lords, to the war with Spain. On that subject, whatever may be my own private opinion, whatever I may know as an individual which may induce me to think that the conduct of the govt. of this country has been correct or otherwise, this house is not in possession of such parliamentary information as can warrant it at present in expressing any opinion on the subject. As, however, the subject has been started, though I think the noble lords would have acted more discreetly in waving it, I must be excused in saying a few words on that point. The noble lord who spoke last has said, that we were not bound to sit tamely by while the Spanish court were supplying our enemies with money and other requisites for waning against us. This I am by no means inclined to dispute. But then, my lords, it would have been but fair and reasonable, in order that a war might not unnecessarily be plunged into, that some precise requisition on the subject should have been made to the Spanish court, and a day fixed for them to give their decisive answer, before hostile measures had been resorted to. I am anxious to know if this has been the case. It is necessary not only that a thing should be fair, equitable, and justifiable in itself, but that the manner in which it is commenced should likewise be fair, just, and agreeable to the known and established law of nations. There is in one part of this business too, an occur-
<col>12</col>
rence of a very melancholy and deplorable kind, which, without imputing blame to any particular person, or at all inquiring into the immediate cause of the accident, I cannot help thinking might have been guarded against. If it was deemed fair and justifiable to detain the Spanish ships, might it hot have been so managed that they should have been met by a force of such superior magnitude, as to have made it not dishonourable in them to submit to the detention, rather than by one of such equal force, as would have entailed disgrace on them, had they surrendered without resistance? Again, if it was fair that ships of war having treasure on board should be detained, I am anxious to know where the policy or propriety could exist of allowing merchants' ships to pass unmolested? These, my lords, are some of the circumstances connected with the rupture with Spain, which appear to me to require explanation, and on account of which, I could not allow the address to pass, without stating that I by no means pledge" myself to say, when the necessary papers are before the house, that I shall think that that business has been properly conducted.&#x2014; There is another part of the address which I cannot allow to pass without observation. It is said, that our army is on a respectable and formidable footing. This term our army was thought six months ago not to deserve, and under the administration of a noble lord (Sidmouth), it was strongly insisted that our army was greatly defective; nay, that was generally understood to have been the ground for that noble lord's retiring from office. It was not in one particular branch too, that this deficiency was said to exist, but in every department. The right hon. gent, who came in, promised us great things; and an act was passed, under his auspices, to effect this purpose. So far, however, from answering the end proposed, it is now allowed that this act has been found completely useless; indeed, a more ridiculous, absurd, and oppressive act, was never conceived. Scarcely a single soldier has been raised by it; nor is it calculated at all for that purpose. By what means, then, I should be glad to ask, has our state of defence, so defective under the noble lord's administration, become so respectable and effective under his right hon. successor's, without any aid but the ridiculous, absurd, and unproductive act to which I have just alluded?. But I suppose it will be insisted
<image src="S1V0003P0I0021"/>
<col>13</col>
by the right hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt), that every thing is now very well, and that there is nothing inefficient or defective in the govt. of the country. I beg it, however, to be understood, that in agreeing to the address, I do not mean to admit the respectability of the state of our army, whenever that shall become the subject of discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00689"><member>Lord Hawkesbury.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;My Lords; I feel proper to trouble your lordships with a few observations, in consequence of a part of what has fallen from the noble earl. There never existed an occasion on which general unanimity could be more justifiably called for on the part of his Majesty's govt. than in the present moment. Upon the general sentiment, with respect to the leading topic in the communication from the throne, I trust no Englishman can entertain but one opinion. No doubt can exist as to the incumbent duty of using every exertion, under the present circumstances, to support the honour of his Majesty's crown, and the dignity of the country at large, in carrying on with vigour the important contest in which we are engaged, in order to bring it to an honourable and prosperous issue; such an issue as shall be consistent with the honour and dignity of this country, and the interests of these powers of Europe with whom we are connected by amity and good faith. Under such considerations alone can peace be deemed desirable, and whenever it can be secured upon such grounds, sensible I am, that it will be cheerfully embraced by his Majesty's govt. By too great an extent of concession, and by discovering too great an eagerness for negotiation, I fear it was, that we fell into the snare which led to the present war.&#x2014; The noble earl has particularly touched upon two points, though not, as I understood him, with a view of opposing the address. The first related to the question of the war with Spain, which the noble earl seems to think would have been unnecessary, were it not for some apprehensions which had fell from the noble mover of the address. In these, however, I imagine, that the noble lord must have been misunderstood, because he did not say any thing that implied a wish that the house should be committed beyond the simple specification in the address. We must, as the royal communication informs us, have the manifesto and the other official documents before us, ere we can properly give
<col>14</col>
any opinion upon the subject. His Majesty trusts that these papers will be duly-considered; and all that is proposed by the address is to say, that your lordship will consider the subject, coupled with an assurance that we are willing to support the dignity of the crown, and the interests of his Majesty's subjects. I heard nothing that fell from either of the noble lords which went to justify the inference of the noble earl. With the latter, however, I agree, that the subject should be considered in its various bearings of justice and policy; and though a particular line of conduct, if adopted by his Majesty's govt. may be fully warranted by the justice of the case, still, under the existing circumstances, it might not have been politic, and, in the former view, the question of war might have been brought to a short issue. When this important question comes to be discussed, I shall give my opinion as to the policy of entering into hostilities at the period to which I allude, and this I shall found upon the circumstances and facts of the case. There is, I admit, a third point of view, independent of both the former, in which the question may be considered, viz. how far, in the progress of the affair, the conduct of ministers may have been inconsistent with the honour of his Majesty's crown, or militate against that character for generous liberality, which is the distinguished characteristic of the British nation? On these considerations, however interesting or important, I shall forber to expatiate until the papers are regularly before the house; but it is proper your lordships should feel assured, that no disposition existed on the part of govt. to do that which may wear an appearance of rashness or precipitation; it is also important it should even now be understood, that the transaction alluded to, though justified by every principle of the law of nations, or of self-defence; is not necessarily connected with the situation in which the two countries are now relatively placed. I am happy in the opportunity of informing your lordships, that the point on which the noble earl's principal doubt seems to hang, was literally acted on in the very manner he himself has suggested. An explanation was demanded from the Spanish govt. and a particular day fixed for the final answer of that court. The explanation demanded by our govt. was refused; intimation of our resolution to detain their Ships was made;
<image src="S1V0003P0I0022"/>
<col>15</col>
our minister at Madrid had applied for passports; had obtained them, and had actually taken his departure, before the news of the capture of their, ships had reached Spain, I agree, however, with the noble earl, that both the justice and policy of the measure, and the mode in which it has been executed and carried through, are all subjects proper for investigation, but they will come to be judged of more properly when the necessary papers, are on your lordship's table.&#x2014;In regard to the state of the internal defence of the country, which forms the second part of the noble earl's animadversions, I will, without any reference to what has transpired on former occasions, venture to contend, that, considering the circumstances of the country at the period alluded to, a more formidable and effective military force has been constituted than was firmed at any corresponding period of any preceding war; and that the present state of our military preparations is positively unparalleled in the history of the country. It would be premature to go into minute details as to the state of the public force in the united kingdom, at this moment. I can, however, assure the noble earl, that in troops of the line, militia and volunteers, ready to take the field, it considerably exceeds 600,000 men; and that under the operation of an act of parliament passed the session before last, commonly called the army of reserve act, the disposable part of that force has been increased to an extent, and with a rapidity beyond all expectation, and has proved superior to every other expedient. Before I sit down, I cannot help expressing a sentiment of proud exultation, that after two years of war, in which the enemy has exhausted all his powers and resources to effect his determined purpose of invading our shores, he has been repelled by the menacing front which the vigour of this country has opposed to him. The spirit and zeal of the country never rose so high as it is at present, and that it has so risen, is owing to those blessings which every Englishman enjoys under the protection of our happy and glorious constitution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00690"><member>The Duke of Clarence</member><membercontribution> did not expect, after what had fallen from his noble friend behind him (Earl Carlisle), that another word would have passed on the subject of the present address. As, however the noble secretary of state had thought proper to make some explanations
<col>16</col>
on the subject of the rupture with Spain, he must be excused for declaring that he Cordially agreed with the noble earl in thinking that it would have been more becoming the magnanimity and humanity of this great nation to have employed a fleet of double the strength, in the detention of the Spanish ships, when that detention was resolved on, by which means the unhappy accident which had occurred would have been avoided. The act by which it had been alledged that our army was to be rendered so completely effective, and by which such wonderful things were to have been produced, he also agreed with the noble earl in thinking absurd and ridiculous in the extreme, and completely inadequate to any good purpose, He hoped one of the first acts of the present session would be to repeal it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00691"><member>Lord Granville.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;My Lords; I rise to give my entire and complete concurrence to every part of the address. It so perfectly coincides with every expression which I have used, and every sentiment which I have uniformly professed, upon the great question which it embraces, I mean the question of war, that it must of necessity command my full and entire consent. I hold it my duty, and the duty of every man, not only in this house, but in the country at large, to concur in the determination to support the war in which we are engaged, with that vigour and firmness from which alone we can expect a successful and prosperous issue; to support it not merely by words, but by the most strenuous and efficient exertions in his power. By these, general words, I do not mean, however, to pledge myself to all the detail of the several subjects which the address may embrace. With all the particulars of the state of the military force of the country, and other subjects, which it comprehends, I cannot be presumed so well acquainted as to be able, at this moment, to give a decided opinion. Upon these, then, I must reserve myself, until the necessary papers are laid before the house, and I shall have had time to consider them; but, with this reservation, I repeat, that the address has my full and complete concurrence, and that it becomes the duty of every man in this country to support the war by his most vigorous exertions. I am sure it will have the concurrence of every British heart; for it must be the feeling of every man, that we ought steadily, constantly, and vigo-

<col>17</col>
rously to persevere in the contest in which we are engaged; until we ban bring it to a safe and honourable termination; and towards that effect, that we ought all to surround the throne with an unanimous declaration of supporting his Majesty in the resolution which he has this day so graciously expressed, of maintaining the honour and interests of the empire inviolate. I do assure the noble sec. of state, that there is no individual who enters more earnestly into the wish which lie so warmly expressed oft this subject than myself. We can have but one sentiment on the principle of national honour and security. Whatever differences there may be as to the manner of attaining the great end, there can be none as to the end itself. I rejoice, therefore, that the address is drawn up in terms in which this house can unanimously agree. I shall only, therefore, detain you, my lords, by a remark on two points, which form the principal features of the speech. The first is the overture which his Majesty has been graciously pleased to signify has been made to him by the French government. It is impossible to say at this moment more than this; that, uninformed as to the tenor and extent of that overture, and uninformed of the basis, if any, winch it proposes for a negotiation; or of the disposition and temper with which it was made; or of any one circumstance connected with it; we can only join his Majesty in a general declaration that peace is undoubtedly desirable, provided that it can be obtained upon terms which shall give permanent security to the British empire; that it shall be honourable as well as secure; and that it shall be consistent with the general interests and tranquillity of Europe. This is the declaration which his Majesty has been graciously pleased to make in his speech, and in this declaration I most perfectly concur. It is candid, honourable, and magnanimous. It is the dignified, as well as the political language which this country ought to maintain; and I therefore congratulate the house on the reception which has been given to this overture. I understand by the speech, that his majesty thinks it essential to the honour and security of this empire, that he should enter into no negotiation, until he has advised with those powers on the continent, with whom he is in the habits of confidential intercourse and connection. I rejoice in this declaration, and wish even that in practice the principle
<col>18</col>
may be carried further. In my opinion, it is the wise policy of G. Britain, in the present state of Europe, to solicit communication with every power on this great and important subject; and to endeavour^ by every mean to obtain the co-operation of every power which has a community of interest, or a community of sentiment. There is no safe and no honourable peace to be obtained by other means. You must cultivate this understanding by every means; you must take no step without a constant, steady, and confidential communication, with every one who feels with you, that the very bonds of society, and of all just government, require this co-operation. Above all others, it is material to consult that great power who is represented as sympathising in your opinion; and who is, undoubtedly, by his position, interests, and capacity, your natural ally in this great work. These opinions I have never failed to express at every period of this war when I have had occasion to trouble your lordships, since I had the honour of a seat among you; and I rejoice to see that they now appear to be duly appreciated by the house in general. I have heard the noble lord's declaration to-night with the most heart-felt pride and satisfaction. They are such as he was heretofore accustomed to maintain, and they do him infinite honour. I wish I could repeat his words verbatim, that I might still further endeavour to enforce them on every heart; but I think his expression was, that it was by too great an extent of concession, and by shewing too great an eagerness for negotiation, that we had fallen into the snare which led to the present war, since it had taught our enemy to regard us as a conquered country. No reflection could be more true; no recollection could be more useful. It ought to be a warning to us in every step we take, and the experience of this fatal truth ought now to animate and guide our couucils,&#x2014;As to the other subject, the new war in which we are involved with Spain, I perfectly agree with the noble? lord who moved the address; that we ought to lose no time in assuring his Majesty, that we will make every exertion to support his just rights, and the honour and dignity of his crown; but we cannot go one step further, until we have the papers laid before us, and have ascertained the grounds upon which we are called upon to enter into this war. I cannot agree that the mere naked fact, which is stated: by a
<image src="S1V0003P0I0024"/>
<col>19</col>
noble lord as being notorious, that money supplies have been given by Spain to France, affords in itself a satisfactory proof of the justice of the war. Admitting that fact simply, I must go farther for an explanation of the grounds of war. I by no means wish to weaken or to diminish in any degree the just rights of the realm, in maintaining the laws of nations. But, on the other hand, with every leaning towards our own claims and rights, we ought not to be betrayed into a temper that shall make us forget what is due to our enemies. It ought to be recollected, that by the law of nations, a supply of succours by a neutral power to an enemy, to a limited extent, previously ascertained, and that by treaty concluded before the war, is not to be considered as an act of hostility, nor made the ground of a rupture. This is not my individual opinion alone, but it is the recognized sentiment of civilized Europe; and therefore I say, the mere noted fact of Spain having fulfilled her mere treaty with France, is not upon the face of it a justification of the war. But it is impossible to speak until we shall see the papers. I must, however, concur with my noble friend (the earl of Carlisle), that there are two points of view in which the war with Spain is to be examined; namely, as to the question of right, and the question of expediency. It is not merely requisite that the house and the nation should be convinced that the war was actually provoked, but also that in the mode of conducting the explanations that were demanded, and in all the steps that led to it, there was no harshness that could have been avoided. It is necessary to shew us that we have not merely right on our side, but that we did not by any improper, violent, and unjustifiable precipitation on our part, hurry them to a rupture, that by prudence, respect, and dignified forbearance, might have been prevented. It is only by facts, as they shall come out in the papers to be laid on the table, that these two points can be ascertained. And I only say, therefore, for the present, that a very unfavourable impression has been made on the public mind by the manner in which this rupture first manifested itself. This unfavourable impression is universally felt, and it is essential to the British character that it should be removed. Facts only can remove it; and I therefore trust, that no time will be lost by ministers, in giving
<col>20</col>
us the means of forming a true, candid, and fair judgment. I have expressed no opinion that the capture of the Spanish frigates off Cape St. Mary is unwarranted by the law of nations; but the impression made by that proceeding is bad, nor is it in the least removed by what has been declared this day from authority; I mean that, before the capture was known at Madrid, our minister had demanded his passports, and quitted that city. God forbid that the departure of an ambassador from a country to which he was accredited, should be considered tantamount to a declaration of war, or a just ground for it! I shall, however, refrain from saying any thing farther upon the subject until a proper opportunity, and I hope that other noble lords will reserve themselves until the necessary documents shall be laid before the house. I shall only repeat, that I lament the unfavourable opinion which the capture of the Spanish squadron has produced. In a war like the present, when we avow the necessity of consulting the opinion of enlightened Europe, it becomes indispensable for us to show, that in our conduct we have not merely respected the rights of an independent state, but that we have observed all the respect that is due to the sovereign of a brave, a high-minded, and an honourable people.&#x2014;With respect to other topics that have fallen from noble lords this day, I shall not detain you with any observations now. The state of our force, the magnitude of our preparations, and the security which we enjoy, will all be the subject of future discussion. In the mean time, I cannot hear it made the source of self-congratulation and of panegyric, that we have been near two years at war, and have not yet been invaded. I confess, that that is no great cause of triumph; and. I hope that we shall reap other laurels from the strength, spirit, and zeal of our armies and navies, than the mere boast that the enemy has not landed on our shores. My lords, I concur in the motion for the address, and I again express my sincere satisfaction at the sentiment which has been so unequivocally declared to-day, that it is only in communion with the great powers of Europe that we can listen to any terms of pacification with the govt. of France.</membercontribution></p>

day of this session, which contained not the slightest mention of a measure, which was very generally expected to have formed one of its most prominent features, namely, the measure of final emancipation of the Catholics of Ireland. When a right hon. gent. now at the head of his Majesty's councils, formerly retired from power, it was avowed by him and his friends, and universally understood, that he retired only because he was not allowed to carry that measure for which his administration stood pledged with the Catholics of Ireland. When that right hon. gent, returned to power, every one naturally conceived, that one of the first acts of his administration would have been to bring that measure forward. The advanced period of the last session, at which he was called to his Majesty's councils, might afford a reason for not then bringing the question forward; but no one doubted that he would propose it early in this; and that it would have been noticed in the speech from the throne. Having himself had no communication with any individual or body of men of that community, and understanding only from the public prints, that the principal Catholics in Ireland had held some meetings, and resolved to prefer their petition to parliament, he wished now only to know what was the intention of his Majesty's ministers upon the subject. If he should receive for answer, that his Majesty's ministers declined to bring it forward, because the Catholics themselves had resolved to press on their own petition; or if (which he did not expect) he should be told by ministers, that the Catholics, in the present circumstances of the country, were content with the concessions already-made to them for the security of property and freedom of religion, he should urge the subject no further: but if not, it must form the subject of a future discussion; for he was convinced, that the best mode of securing peace, and maintaining our respect abroad, was by conciliation and unanimity at home,</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-00695"><member>The Marquis of Abercorn</member><membercontribution> rose and spoke to the following effect.&#x2014;My lords; I take this opportunity to remind your lordships of a business which I took the liberty of mentioning to your lordships in the course of the last session. I allude to the charge of misconduct which I have brought forward against Mr. Justice Fox, one of his. majesty's judges in Ireland. It may be thought, perhaps, that there has been too great delay on my part for an affair of this nature. I can, however, safely say, that I am a man who never threw away an hour in my life which ought to have been devoted to any important business in which I was concerned, and of that description I consider the present to be. I can also pledge myself to your lordships; that upon this occasion almost the whole of my time has been occupied in preparing the charges, and the evidence in support of them, for the purpose of laying them before the house. It is, therefore, with a degree of satisfaction, although I confess the subject is not one calculated to afford pleasure, I can now inform your lordships, that every inquiry which I have made, and every information which I have been able to collect, have served to confirm me in my original opinion upon this subject; and that I have all the charges, and the evidence to support them, perfectly arranged and complete, except only one, and that is the least important of the whole. The form of the proceedings your lordships are to direct and determine, as you shall think proper. All that was necessary for me to do I have done, and am ready to lay the documents before the> house at a moment's notice</membercontribution></p>

His object in wishing for this delay, is obvious, as he will of course have to examine some of the judges and lawyers in his defence. To call upon them at a time that would interfere with their business, is an inconvenience which ought to be avoided, if possible. It would therefore be desirable if the. time were so arranged, that the witnesses might be examined here, in the interval between the close of the term and the ensuing assizes, so as to enable them to return home in time to attend their circuits.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00697"><member>Lord Hawkesbury.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;My lords; this is the first case of the kind, I believe, which has happened since the passing of the law, that renders the judges independent of the crown. J am extremely sorry that it should have ever been found necessary to take a business of this very important and peculiar nature into your consideration, and that such a case should have ever occurred. Of the circumstances you neither have, or can have, as yet, any information that can now be examined into. However, as articles of impeachment are to be laid before the house against a judge of the land; for the sake of pure justice, for the sake of the constitution, and for the fake of the judge himself, who is placed in this peculiar situation, and whose character rests upon the result, it is necessary that the charge should be investigated speedily. I would therefore propose, that the necessary documents be laid upon the table on Monday, and that the house shall, at the same time, determine upon the form and mode of the proceeding upon them.</membercontribution></p>

I am aware of the importance of many of the topics which, in the speech that has now been read, arc submitted to the consideration of the house. But, at the same time, I believe, that there are few-points which can disturb the unanimity which ought to prevail at this momentous crisis. Our situation requires unanimity, and therefore I trust that none will be disposed to take any unreasonable grounds of objection to the address, which I shall by.
<col>26</col>
and-by have the honour of moving. I am perfectly persuaded, that there are many paragraphs in his majesty's speech which must occasion universal joy and satisfaction to all those who have the good of their country, and the tranquillity of the world at heart; but I am aware, at the same; time, that there are others where the in formation given may not seem to many gentlemen so complete as they could have wished. These are points, however, which at present ought not to be rashly and prematurely introduced into discussion, till the desirable information relating to them can be conveniently laid before the house. Of these I would particularly advert to the second paragraph, which refers to the war with Spain. Upon this subject the opinions entertained will probably be very different, a cording to the particular view in which each individual may be disposed to regard it. But till the papers which his Majesty has been graciously pleased to order to be laid before us, for the purpose of bringing the affair completely under our view, shall be produced, the propriety of refraining from any long discussion on this head must he obvious to every impartial person. It is impossible that any man can with justice pretend to give any clear and decided opinion on a point, relative to which his information must as yet be considered as extremely defective. Considering the times and the circumstances in which we are placed, every possible regard, it must be obvious, ought to be paid to candour and moderation.&#x2014;With regard to the pacific overtures which, we are informed, have been made to his majesty, these, I am sure, must have afforded the highest plea, sure and satisfaction to every one; and after the variety of opinions that have been, delivered by many gentlemen in this house on the situation of this country and the continent, it must indeed be highly gratifying that the present state of affairs afford so flattering and cheering a prospect. All of us must have felt no small degree of delight and satisfaction at receiving proofs off the just sense which the Emperor of Russia appears to entertain of the aggressions and outrageous conduct of France. There are now the best grounds of hope that the continental nations will be awakened to a proper sense of what is due to themselves and to the liberties of Europe, in case France should persist in a line of conduct which may render it impossible to restore the blessings of peacet&#x2014;Sir, with regard to the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0028"/>
<col>27</col>
defence of the country, the measures that lave been adopted for the furtherance of that great object, have, as his majesty Informs us, been attended with the most happy effect. Much of the merit that belongs to this circumstance, may be justly claimed by the wisdom of parliament, and the zeal and ardour of the people. Yet, for the respectability of our defensive situation, much is also due to the exertions of the executive govt. To his majesty's ministers we owe the excellent state of defence in which Ireland has been placed, a part of the empire which the enemy may, per-laps, be disposed to consider as the most eligible point of attack. His majesty has directed us to turn our attention to another point, which he justly states as of the utmost importance. He has requested that we should give him that support which alone can enable him to bring the present contest to a safe and honourable termination. The greatest eagerness has been manifested by this house, to give his majesty the most effectual support in its power, and I trust that, at this moment, the exertions of parliament will not be discontinued. His majesty has particularly adverted to the support of public credit, and I have no doubt that in this respect the house will feel every disposition to concur with his majesty. That the burdens which the people must endure are heavy and unpleasing, must be confessed; but considering the magnitude of the object for which we are contending, and the great efforts that must necessarily be made, I hope that these burdens will be borne with patience and unanimity.&#x2014;These, Sir, are the principal circumstances to which I have thought it right to advert. With regard to the war with Spain, I trust that we shall not press to a rash and premature conclusion; but that gentlemen will wait with patience till the information ordered by his majesty shall bring that affair completely before them: Without trespassing further on the house, or going more minutely into the particulars contained in his majesty's address, I shall conclude with moving, that the following address be presented to his majesty, viz.&#x2014;"Most gracious sovereign, we, your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the commons of the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in parliament assembled, beg leave to return your majesty the thanks of this house for your most gracious speech from the throne. &#x2014;We have witnessed with pride and satis-

Although the preparations for the invasion of this kingdom have been continued with incessant activity, we are firmly persuaded that while this spirit animates the country, and its voluntary exertions for its own defence subsist in their full vigour, they will be found sufficient to deter the enemy from attempting to carry their repeated menaces into effect; and we shall never forget that as our security has arisen from the resolution with which we have met-and provided against the danger, we can be preserved only by steady perseverance and unremitting activity.&#x2014;We beg leave to return your majesty our humble thanks, for having been graciously pleased to direct that a copy of the manifesto which you have caused to be prepared in consequence of the rupture with Spain should be laid before us, together with such papers as are necessary to explain the discussions which, have taken place between your majesty arid, that court; and we assure your majesty that we will take them into our early and serious consideration.&#x2014; While we regret the extension of hostilities, your majesty may rely on our constant support to such measures as may be necessary for maintaining the honour of your crown, and asserting the just rights of your people.&#x2014; We feel in common with your majesty, that on the continent the general conduct of the French govt. has been marked by the utmost violence and outrage, and has shewn a wanton defiance of the rights of neutral territories, of the acknowledged privileges of accredited ministers, and of the established principles of the law of nations.&#x2014; We humbly acknowledge your majesty's goodness in having been pleased to inform us, that notwithstanding these transactions (so repugnant to every sentiment of moderation and justice) your majesty has recently received a communication from the French govt. containing professions of a pacific disposition; and while we feel deeply sensible of your majesty's paternal regard and unremitting solicitude for the welfare and happiness of your people, expressed in your majesty's earnest desire to embrace the first opportunity or restoring the blessings of peace, on such grounds as

fleet, which has blockaded every port of the enemy, from the Adriatic to the Texel, at such a time, and in such circumstances, I trust that every one will feel it his first duly to grant his majesty that support which he now requires, and which every thing tells us ought to be given. At the time, sir, when we are told that we have a new enemy to contend with; an enemy, I fear, misled by weak counsels, and goaded on by the tyrannical and despotic power of France; an enemy whose hostile disposition every circumstance has concurred to prove; we ought not to be backward in meeting our difficulties with that resolution and firmness which the danger calls for. There are moments, sir, when to much forbearance becomes pusillanimity. One of these moments has now arrived. I shall not enter minutely into this question till the documents promised by his Majesty are laid before us. Then will be the proper time to consider it particularly. To discuss it at present at any length, would be altogether premature. I am most happy, at the pacific overtures that have been made to his majesty by the French govt.: God grant they may be sincere, and that they may pave the way for a safe and permanent peace! In the mean time, I have no doubt that the govt. of this country will act with that dignity and moderation which become the character of a great nation, which is anxious to preserve the peace of the world, though it cannot suffer its own honour and security to be trifled with. We have heard, sir, of the internal prosperity, the increasing, commerce and; wealth of our country, and who could, hear it without the greatest satisfaction I While they secure us the means of prosecuting the war with vigour, in case that should be necessary, they at the same time furnish us with the ability to secure a peace on safe and honourable terms, in case our enemies should begin to be, swayed by principles of justice and moderation. I hope, sir, we shall carry to the, foot of the throne the strongest assurances of our firm determination to support his majesty, in whatever measures he may judge advisable for attaining the great objects which we have in view&#x2014;security and national prosperity. With these sentiments, sir, I most heartily second the motion of the hon. gent., and hope that we shall all willingly and zealously rally round our. King and constitution to preserve them in safety and honour, at a crisis the most

momentous that G. Britain or Europe ever experienced.&#x2014;After the motion had been thus seconded, the speaker read the address to the house, and was proceeding to put the question, when</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00706"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> rose and spoke to the following purport: It is not my intention, sir, to trouble the house for any long time upon this occasion, for I certainly do not mean to move an amendment to the address now proposed, nor to advert to any but a few parts of it; but I wish to make a few observations on what appear to me to be two considerable omissions in his majesty's speech; for there is one part of the address on which I do not know how, uninformed is we are at present, we can give an opinion; although, perhaps, there would be no material difference of sentiment, if we understood it, but of which, without information, we cannot judge. I allude to that part of the address in which we say we approve of his majesty's determination not to explain himself further to us on an interesting subject, until he has had intercourse with certain powers. Now, it does not appear to me, I confess, upon the first view of it, that there was any necessity of entering into, that sort of explanation. It may be necessary, or wise, for his majesty to express his wishes for peace, and to communicate to the world that he is willing to enter into the discussion of, and to accede to such terms as were likely, or which ought to produce it; but, when he says he cannot enter into such considerations, until he has consulted certain courts, I do not see how we can approve of this conduct, until we know what is the nature of the intercourse between this Country and the continental powers. Now, though if this were understood generally, or if I understood it, there would probably be no difference of opinion, yet as I do not know, and am not permitted to know, those circumstances, which call for intercourse with other powers, I must think feat the address pledges the house to too much; that it pledges it to approbation of the determination not to explain at present the nature of the communications in question. But as to this explanation in itself, I, for one, must confess that I see no necessity for any explanation, but what appears already on the face of the speech: for his majesty there expresses himself clearly, making professions of a wish for peace. His majesty says directly, that he entertains this wish, but can give no fur-
<col>32</col>
ther explanation until he has consulted certain powers, not allies indeed, but powers with which he has certain discustions, certain confidential intercourse. As I said before, it is impossible to judge of the propriety of all this, until we know the nature of that confidential intercourse j though if I did know it, I might, perhaps, be one to approve of it; but how can the house approve of a statement, the occasion and circumstances of which it does not know?&#x2014;There is one omission in the address which I own has a great deal disappointed me. After what passed three or tour years ago on the subject of the Catholics of Ireland, I did expect, when I heard the name of the lion, mover, that the very first communication from the throne would have had a reference to that subject. I did hope, that his majesty would have been advised, by some one of his present ministers at least, to recommend to parliament the taking of that subject into consideration, in order to afford to us the full effect of the union, and to give to that part of the united kingdom that advantage which I think so essential to its peace. I say, my surprise was increased at this omission when I first heard the name of the hon. gent, who moved this address. I cannot help lamenting, that in the speech from the throne, there is not one word expressive of an intention to recommend that subject to our consideration: a subject so important, that if it be not speedily taken into consideration, no honest man can say there is any thing like stability and security to that part of the British empire. Nor could I collect any allusion to that subject even from the speech of the hon. gent, himself. He spoke indeed of the defensive state of Ireland; but that is a subject I shall not now discuss. I hope Ireland is well defended; but I know the best defence of Ireland is that which is the best defence of England, and of every country in the world-&#x2014;the pure affection and united attachment of the people to the govt. under which they live, and by which they are protected.&#x2014; There is another omission, which, although not less important, is still more surprising. I have observed on former occasions, that when measures have been taken by parliament for the purpose of increasing the power of the country, it was usual for his majesty to compliment us (when I have thought, very often, we had ill-deserved it) on the wisdom of our measures, but
<image src="S1V0003P0I0031"/>
<col>33</col>
how many such compliments may have been just, (for I hope they were not all unjust), I will not discuss, nor to whom they were to be imputed. Some have declared, what others have denied, this to be a new administration; and that the measures we have now are more vigorous. Be that as it may, I expected we should have been told something of the efficacy of our measures, not merely alluding to the discipline of our volunteers, the skill of our navy, and the public spirit of the people; but that we should have heard something by way of commendation of some of our measures; but no notice is taken of any thing of that kind. Nothing is said of that measure which was supposed to make the whole difference between an administration of imbecility and that of vigour; I mean the measure of the right hon. gent. (Mr. Pitt) for the improvement of our military system. I expected we should have heard something of the difference between the two, but not a word. I believe that measure is now allowed to have totally failed. Speaking in the language of common sense, I take the purpose for which that measure was designed, and with a view to which it was adopted, to have completely failed; the consequence of which must be one of two things: either we must give up the object which we had in view by that measure, or adopt some other mode of carrying it into effect. Yet it did give me some surprise, that nothing was said upon that measure itself: neither was our attention called to any thing of that nature. I hope and trust we shall have these matters soon discussed; and in this I am the more confident, when I recollect that those who had not been generally the first to advise the house to take into its own Lands, as some persons called it, the functions of executive govt. by originating measures for the safety of the country in this house, had been resolute on points similar to this, feeling, as they said they did, they could not safely leave them to ministers. The right hon. gent, not only supported measures of that kind, but brought some of them forward himself; and, although he did not then persuade the house to adopt them, yet he had nearly all the effect of persuasion, by convincing the house that something of the kind ought to be adopted. I hope that system will be followed up now; for as to the efficiency of the new bill I have just alluded to, which kept the house in a suc-
<col>34</col>
cession of debates, I believe that is entirely out of the question. I believe the advantage of it, as a system to increase the military strength of the country, to be none.&#x2014;As to the Spanish war, his majesty informs the house, that he intends to lay the papers before us relative to that subject, and therefore to prejudge it would be unwise. I have, however, no difficulty in saying, that the seizing of the Spanish frigates, loaded and destined as they were, does certainly bear an unseemly appearance, and one not much to the honour of this country. Never was there a time when this nation ought to stand so clear of all reproaches similar to those which I allude to in, the present instance.&#x2014;There is mention made in the speech of the violation of the law of nations by the French govt. We should never look at such conduct without the most pointed disapprobation; bur, if we are to make that a part of the war in which we are engaged, it is exceedingly material that we, who thus contend for good faith, moderation, and justice, should be ourselves faithful, moderate, and jus;. 1 should have thought so at any time, and under any circumstances; but more especially at this time, and under the present circumstances, as we make the want of justice and moderation the principal cause of the war. I therefore hope, that neither Spain, nor any of the surrounding nations, whether neutral or at war, whether they vie with each other for outrage, violation, and contempt of the law of nations, or for their reverence for them, will not have it in their power to accuse us justly of any outrage, violation, or contempt of the law of nations, or even, of any indifference to the principles of equity and moderation; and I hope that no partiality for our own country will induce us to overlook any of those principles, whether we look towards Spain or any other power; but that we shall view our own conduct as we would that of a nation that was indifferent to us, with a, due regard to the principles of strict justice and absolute impartiality. I would go further, and say, that, under all the circumstances that belong to this contest, I would not insist on strict justice in every particular, against the power in dispute with us; and I hope the question, whenever it comes to be discussed, will be discussed with good temper and propriety.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00707"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;I do not, sir, conceive it necessary, at this time,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0032"/>
<col>35</col>
to trouble the house with any observations, but I think it necessary to allude to a few things which have fallen from the hon. gent, who spoke last. The hon. gent, has expressed some degree of surprize that the nature of those communications with some of the continental powers, alluded to in his majesty's speech, has not been more distinctly explained to the house. He has declared it to be impossible to judge of the necessity of making a communication of the recent overture of the French govt. without knowing on what terms our relations with those powers now stand. I confess it appears to me that the speech does state what is fully sufficient to warrant such a communication. It states distinctly, that confidential communications do subsist betwixt his majesty and some of the continental powers; and it gives the house assurances of the magnanimous sentiments entertained by the Emperor of Russia, relative to the highest interests of Europe, as well as the security and independence of this country. All those then, who agree that in making, any peace we should look to the situation of the Continent, and think of the most effectual means of establishing those ancient relations which French ambition has overthrown, must be of opinion, that the speech does disclose all that it is now necessary to discover, and will acquiesce in the expediency of being satisfied with what his majesty has laid before the house. I admit, that a period will come, when the house will have a fair right to demand much more ample information, but I flatter myself it is fully aware, that circumstances may exist which would render it equally imprudent and impolitic to enter into a minute or particular description of our relations with the continental powers. I hope, therefore) that the information furnished by the speech will, in the mean time, be received as satisfactory under all circumstances.&#x2014;As to the other points to which the hon. gent, has alluded, being connected with subjects which will, in all probability, at no remote period, engage the attention of the house, I think it unnecessary for me to go now into any length of discussion. I cannot, however, help saying a few words on what the hon. gent, has termed omissions in the speech. The hon. gent. began with expressing his astonishment that the state of Ireland was not even alluded to; and argued, that till the situation, of the Irish Catholics was
<col>36</col>
taken into consideration, that country-never can enjoy any thing like permanent tranquillity or repose. In the broad view which the hon. gent, took of the question, it is impossible for Ireland ever to enjoy the smallest advantage from the union, fill the measures which he appears desirous of recommending are actually pursued. For my part, I entertain a very different view of the subject, for though Ireland certainly, has not derived all the advantages from the union, which that measure is capable of affording, I will maintain, that great advantages have already attended it, and many others may speedily be expected. But I beg leave to ask, how it comes to pass, that, though tour years have elapsed since the union, those measures which the hon. gent. now so loudly calls for, have never been even once recommended? What is there at the present moment which renders these measures so necessary now, that did not formerly suggest the propriety of their adoption? If he himself has entertained the same views which he professes to entertain, he could not consistently have suffered the subject to have remained so long dormant. What the reasons are which have induced me, who entertain very different views of the subject, to suffer it to remain dormant, I shall, on a future occasion, have an opportunity of stating, and I flatter myself, that the house and the country, will give me credit for consistency, when I have stated the reasons which induce me still to think that the matter should remain dormant at the present moment.&#x2014;The hon. gent. has adverted to the bill which I last session introduced for the defence of the country, and has expressed a hope that some more efficient bill will be substituted in its room. This is not the time for a discussion of the subject, but I feel myself called upon to state, that I have seen no reason to alter my opinion of the grounds on which that bill was founded, and though I admit that, its effects, in adding to the numbers of our military force, have indeed been exceedingly small, nothing that has happened, considering all the circumstances under which the bill was proposed, and the principles on which it proceeded, induces me to think that it was not a measure which ought to have been adopted. I am ready at any time to meet the hon. gent, and his friends in reviewing the state of the country in all its various relations, I
<image src="S1V0003P0I0033"/>
<col>37</col>
am ready, in particular, to meet the hon. gent. respecting the state of our military force, and the improved condition in which it now stands, compared to what it was last session. I am ready to shew that, at the present moment, we have a regular disposable force far more considerable than many gentlemen seem to be aware of. But, while I say (his, I am also perfectly willing to agree with these gentlemen, that this regular disposable force should be still further augmented. I will not at all attempt to dispute that means, quite independent of the bill which has been alluded to, might with great propriety be employed for augmenting our regular disposable force to an extent which could render it highly serviceable, whether employed for objects connected, with our separate interests, or the interests and independence of the Continent.&#x2014;On the subject of the rupture with Spain, the hon. gent, has very prudently declined offering any opinion till the documents referred to in the speech from the throne are laid before the house. He has, however, in alluding to the detention of the Spanish frigates, thrown out a sort of suspicion that this was a violent and unjustifiable proceeding. In a very short time, I am persuaded that the hon. gent. and his friends will see reason to alter that opinion, and confess that their suspicions were erroneous. I fully agree with the hon. gent, that at all times, but especially at the present moment, it is highly necessary to keep up the high character of the country for moderation, justice, and honour, and I am firmly convinced, that when the whole of the late transactions with Spain come to be explained, the detention of the frigates will not at all appear, even in the smallest degree, a departure from the strictest rules of moderation or justice. At the time these frigates were detained, I am persuaded it will be seen that his Majesty might have seized them by an act of open hostility; for Spain at that time was substantially guilty of acts of open hostility against this country. As to the capture of the Spanish frigates, I trust the house will clearly see, in that circumstance, only an additional instance of the moderation and justice of his majesty, who, in circumstances that would have warranted the most decided hostilities, wished as long as possible to leave the door open to conciliation, at the same time that he was absolutely bound to take such measures of precaution as not to
<col>38</col>
allow an enemy, already too formidable, to acquire any additional means and resources to carry on the war against this country. When all the circumstances of the case, shall be laid before the consideration of die house, I make no doubt but that they will be of opinion, that so far from acting with any violence or injustice towards Spain, his majesty has acted with as much moderation, forbearance, and tenderness, as it was possible for him to do. All these topics may, in their turn, be the subject of discussion in tills house; but I am glad that it appears to be the general opinion at present, that until these subjects come regularly forward for discussion, we should reserve the consideration of them for the present, and postpone debating them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00708"><member>Mr. Fox,</member><membercontribution> in explanation why he had not brought forward the subject of catholic emancipation, stated, that it was perfectly well understood that any man bringing forward this question unconnected with govt. would have had very little chance of gaining the object. It was, besides, very doubtful how far the measure, would be acceptable to the catholic body, if not taken up, as a matter of justice and policy, by the executive govt.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00709"><member>Mr. Windham</member><membercontribution> vindicated the conduct of his hon. friend (Mr. Fox) as perfectly consistent. He had not brought forward the subject of catholic emancipation during the existence of a cabinet avowedly hostile to that measure; nay, whose very elevation to power was founded on their opposition to it; but it was very different when the cabinet professed a desire to have this measure brought about, and when the person at the head of the cabinet had given an open avowed opinion in favour both of its policy and its justice. This was sufficient to justify the consistency of his hon. friend in recommending the subject to the right hon. gent, at the present moment.&#x2014;But, leaving this topic, the right hon. gent, proceeded to make some observations on the information conveyed by the speech, respecting the state of our continental connections. He was free to acknowledge, that he thought the information on this subject extremely scanty and unsatisfactory. He had expected and hoped something distinct and specific, but he had been disappointed. The house were indeed told of the wise and dignified manifestation of the interest entertained by the Emperor of Russia for the independence of the continent; but the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0034"/>
<col>39</col>
house had no means of knowing to what extent that Sovereign was disposed to cooperate with us against France, or what exertions he was willing to make for the restoration of the ancient balance of power in Europe. As, however, a prospect of further information was held out; as the house were led to believe that satisfactory documents would be afforded, he had the less hesitation in agreeing to the address. &#x2014;Having stated this generally, the right hon. gent, went on to make a few remarks on the language of the address, relative to the rupture with Spain, lie was rather afraid that the language conveyed something too much like an approbation of the rupture, even before the house were in possession of the documents necessary to found an opinion. Perhaps he was mistaken in this, but the words sounded in his ears very much as if this were their import, and he was therefore anxious to guard against any idea that the house gave the slightest sanction either to the rupture with Spain or the detention of the Spanish frigates. Though in the absence of all documents the house could not pronounce either final approbation or final disapprobation, yet he must contend, that it was not therefore necessary or proper that nothing should be said. On the contrary, it was is many cases desirable, that an opinion should be given on the successive stages of a business of this sort as they severally appealed at the time. In private causes, where few were interested besides the parties, where the whole was dispatched in a short time, judgment might, and ought, in general, to be deferred to the last. There was nothing to make it necessary that any opinion should be declared, till the whole was gone through. Bui not so in these causes of nations, tried before the tribunal of the world, and where the parts did not succeed each other but at long intervals. It might then be often of great consequence, that the feelings of people should manifest themselves, on the several states of the question as they successively arose. He should be sorry, for instance, in the present case, if, informed of this cause no further than they then were, any sentiment could be felt about it, but that of strong reprobation, and if, moreover, that sentiment were not expressed. It was useful to have it known, how individuals, bow the country felt upon the question such as it then appeared; reserving, of course, their
<col>40</col>
final judgment till the whole of the case should be finally before them. He was anxious, therefore, to be understood as stating his opinion, subject to such explanations as might here after be given, (which he could not deny to lie possible, but was wholly unable to anticipate, and should be most happy to hear) that the principle and policy of the war wre, to say the least of them, highly questionable, and the mode of commencing it the most disgraceful and criminal of any that he could call to mind. This was the feeling which-he had at present, and which, be feared, he must continue to keep, should it not happily be done away by the disclosure of circumstances not now known, nor easily conjectured. He had an observation to make on the description given in the address of the stale of our regular army, which is said to be in a respectable condition. If the respectability spoken of was meant to be applied to the quality of cur regular force, no one could assent to the statement mere cheerfully. No man had a higher opinion than he had of the valour and discipline of our regular army. If, on the other hand, it was applied to their number, he could by no means admit the truth of this assertion. The address spoke of the improved discipline of our numerous volunteers. On that subject he would only remark, that admitting the improvement really to have taken place, the statement should have been, the improved discipline of our less numerous volunteers.&#x2014; He really could not help thinking, that the language of the address respecting the invasion was quite superfluous, and might very easily have been omitted. We had no evidence that the enemy had given up the threat of invasion. We only knew that his preparations were now more complete than at any former period. The enemy had not thought proper to disclose to us when his long threatened attack was actually to take place; and there was no sort of evidence, that if once seriously entertained, it was now seriously abandoned. The wording of the speech was, indeed, cautious in that respect. It did not say that our preparations <i>had</i> deterred him, but that they were <i>sufficient</i> to deter him. But even this had better have been omitted. As we knew nothing about the matter, we had better have said nothing about it, The right hon. gent, next touched on the violent and unjust proceedings of the French govt. mentioned in the address,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0035"/>
<col>41</col>
Among these, there were few more marked and direct, than that which was now operating in the person of Capt. Wright, of the Vincejo ship of war. This of-officer, as the house would probably know, was taken valiantly fighting on board his ship, in circumstances of the most clear and legitimate warfare; but, because the enemy chose to entertain suspicions respecting former services performed by him, and which, if true, would be nothing to their purpose, was detained a close prisoner in the Temple, and threatened even with farther proceedings, contrary to every rule and practice of war, as observed among civilized nations. He had now remained in that situation longer than he (Mr. W.) could immediately state (persons who view misfortunes at a distance do not count the period of their duration, as, it was to be feared, he must do who reckoned his days and hours through the bars of a prison), and far longer than it was for the honour of this country that be should have so remained. The right hon. gent, said, he had brought forward the subject at the close of the last session, and he now renewed it at the commencement of the present. If ministers were doing their duty, as he had reason to hope they were, the mention of the subject, and the manner in which, he was sure, it would be received by the house, would give support to their endeavours. If they were not, the same circumstances would serve as an admonition, and co-operate with the opinion which be wished to impress, that if other means failed, it was high time to have recourse to measures, which, whether effectual or not, must at last be resorted to, namely, the use of a similar treatment to all those officers whom the fortune of war had thrown into our power. These were the only means which nations had of enforcing a due observance of the laws of war, in favour of those who risked themselves honourably in their service. &#x2014;The right hon. gent, before he sat down, expressed his regret that his hon. friend (Mr. Fox) had not given notice of the renewal of his motion, for a committee to examine the state of the national defence. He thought such a committee fully as necessary now as at the period when it was proposed last session. If his hon. friend, or some other gent, did not take up the business, he should certainly think it his duty to bring it under consideration on an early day. The right hon. gent, afterwards
<col>42</col>
named Monday se'nnight for that purpose. The question was then put upon the address, and agreed to <i>ncm. con.</i>&#x2014;Adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

The bill of last session was brought in, he observed, at so very late a period, that the house was unavoidably deprived of the assistance, in its discussion, of several of its most able and best-informed members (of that of his noble and learned friend, for instance), who were absent on calls of indispensable duty; he wondered not, therefore, at the late act requiring so much amendment. To this was to be added another consideration, that acts of that description, when passed towards the close of a session, generally create an idea that the relief is meant to be extended farther than is really the case. On these grounds he highly approved of the present bill, and begged leave to repeat his thanks

tion, last session, to have given notice of a motion respecting the state of Ireland, but upon communicating with some noble lords, he had thought it advisable to defer it for the moment. Circumstances had since undergone an important change. Fortunately for this country, fortunately for Europe, and, he trusted, fortunately for that part of the united kingdom, a minister was placed at the head of affairs, who had pledged himself, in some measure, to support the cause of that country. As the thing stood at present, he wished, as far as was practicable, to ascertain the intentions of govt. on that important point before he should proceed further, or to see what steps the executive govt. should take in the business. Another consideration with him would be the result of the petition on the part of the Roman Catholics in Ireland. If the prayer of it was acceded to, he should not, perhaps, have any occasion to trouble their lordships on that point. But, should no petition be presented, or, if presented, be rejected, then he should feel it his duty to make the motion, of the necessity of which he had long been convinced by observation and experience. Indeed he could not well bring himself to imagine that it would be opposed by a minister who had given a solemn pledge to use his best and incessant endeavours in support of the measure which he was anxious should be submitted to their lordships; more especially when he recollected, as their lordships must also recollect, that without the influence of that pledge and promise, that minister could never have succeeded in bringing about the great measure of the union.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[Additional Force Bill.]&#x2014;</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00718"><member>Earl Darnley</member><membercontribution> said, that he was desirous to be acquainted with the effect of a measure brought forward last session, commonly known by the name of the additional force bill. He had reason to apprehend that this measure was far from having attained its object, or rather that it had proved wholly inadequate to it. Should there be no objection to such a motion, he would now give notice, that it was his intention in a few days, to move, That there be laid before the house, an account of the number of men raised through the operation of the said act. That motion he should follow up with another, respecting the operation of the same measure with regard to Ireland. The noble lord was desirous to make the motions separately; because,
<col>46</col>
with regard to Ireland, at least it would appear, that the provisions of that bill were net only inadequate for the defence of that country, but proved moreover, an onerous and oppressive tax on that part of the united kingdom, and fat beyond that proportion which by the articles of the union, it was bound to bear.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00719"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> did not conceive there would be any objection to the motion; the noble lord might make it now, if he thought proper, nor was it necessary, in his opinion, to make separate motions on the same subject respecting the two countries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00720"><member>Earl Darnley</member><membercontribution> acquiesced in part of the noble secretary's suggestion, but persisted in dividing the two motions. His lordship then moved "that an humble address be presented to his majesty, praying that his majesty would be graciously pleased to give directions, that there be laid before the house an account of the number of men raised in pursuance of the additional force bill." This motion was agreed to, as also a similar one with regard to Ireland.</membercontribution></p>

His lordship then presented the heads of the charges made against justice Fox, and concluded by moving, that the house should resolve itself into a committee on Thursday next, to consider the said papers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00722"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution> observed, that the business before the house was one of the most important that could come under their lordship's deliberation. It was therefore of the greatest importance that they should consider well what mode of proceeding ought to be adopted. By the act of the 1st of his present majesty, by which it was enacted that the commissions of the judges should not be terminated by the demise of the crown, it was proved that a judge might be removed upon an address to his majesty from both houses of Parliament, praying for such removal. The question, therefore, in this case, must ultimately be, whether the facts alledged against Mr. Justice Fox were such as to-call upon their lordships to concur in as
<image src="S1V0003P0I0038"/>
<col>47</col>
address for his removal. An important question, however, arose as to the mode of proceeding, in the first instance, and it would probably become a subject for their lordships deliberation on Thursday next, whether they should call upon Judge Fox to answer to the facts as alledged by the noble marquis, or whether they ought not first to proceed some length in the investigation of those alledged facts, in order to ascertain if such a case was made out as entitled them to call upon that judge to defend himself. This was a subject of the Utmost importance, and demanded grave and serious consideration. He was happy that this was the only instance that had hitherto occurred since the passing of the bill alluded to of the conduct of a judge becoming the subject of a discussion like the present, and it was certainly incumbent upon the house to determine as to the mode of proceeding with the greatest caution and deliberation.&#x2014;The motion of the noble marquis was then agreed to; and their lordships were ordered to be summoned for Thursday.&#x2014;Adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

It affords me the greatest satisfaction to receive the declaration of your full concurrence in the sentiments which have dictated my answer to the communication from the French govt. The conviction you express that the safety and permanent interests of this country are closely connected with the security of Europe, and the cordial assurances of your zealous support in enabling me to prosecute the war with vigour till it can be brought to a safe and honourable termination, are calculated to produce the happiest effects in the present situation of affairs."&#x2014;A new writ was ordered for Droitwich, in the room of sir E.

<title>[WAR IN INDIA.]&#x2014;</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00724"><member>Mr. Francis.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;Sir; the motion which I mean to submit to the house will not make it necessary for me to trouble you with many reasons in support of it, or for more than a few minutes; and, indeed, it appeared to me so much a matter of course, that I should not have thought it required a previous notice, but for a suggestion which I am always desirous to comply with. In the course of the last session, the house thought fit to order a great variety of papers to be laid before them, to explain the causes of the war which began in 1803, against two of the principal Mahratta chiefs, Scindia and Boosla. By the papers before the house it appears, that those chiefs were subdued and reduced to submission, and that treaties of peace had been signed with them about the close of the same year; and it was natural to conclude that there was an end of the war in India. Nothing could be more improbable than that any of the remaining Mahratta powers should take up the contest, where
<image src="S1V0003P0I0039"/>
<col>49</col>
the others had left it; and especially against an enemy flushed with success, and which the greatest powers of the Mahratta empire had not been able to resist. Neverthless it is known, that another war with another chief, called Holcar, immediately, or soon after, succeeded to the pacification with Scindia and Boosla. I consider it as the final act of the same transaction, and that the information before the house would not be complete without the papers relative to these last hostilities, which I propose to move for. I hold it to be of importance to the good govt. and safety of our possessions in India, that a regular communication of all material transactions should, at proper intervals, be made to parliament, and that the record of them should be preserved in this house. I have no doubt that Holcar has been subdued; his force, compared with ours, is so inconsiderable, that one can only wonder at his venturing, at such a time especially, to provoke a quarrel with a power so much superior to him. Nevertheless he has certainly been able to make some resistance, and we know that many lives have been lost already in the course of this petty war. In one of the provinces ceded to us, called Bundalcund, a party of his cavalry surrounded a detachment of ours, consisting of two complete companies of sepoys, some cannon, and fifty European artillerymen, every man of whom were cut to pieces. The loss of the sepoys is to be lamented; that of the artillery-men is invaluable. The main body, from which this little force was detached, immediately retired, and the officer who commanded it was put under arrest. I need not say more to prove that these transactions deserve the attention of the house. I am not aware of any reasonable objection to the motion, but if any should be made, I hope the house will permit me to reply to it. I move you, sir, "That there be laid before this house, copies or extracts of all letters or correspondence received from India, since the last session of parliament, relative to hostilities between the British govt. and a Mahratta chief, called Jesswunt Rao Holcar, and the causes thereof, as far as may be consistent with the public service, and with the good faith due to persons from whom secret intelligence may have been received."&#x2014;Before I sit down, I wish to mention a subject connected with the Mahratta war, on
<col>50</col>
which the house has received no information. I expected to find it explained in the printed papers, but in them there is no mention of it. In the country of Guzzerat, to the north west of Bombay, there is a prince called the Gwicowar: a part of his territory has been ceded to the company, partly to make good the pay of our subsidiary force stationed at Poona, and for no other objects of indemnification. Out of that fund we ought to have received a considerable revenue; but to that prince the govt. of Bombay have lent a sum not much less than 360,000l. The documents relative to this extraordinary transaction, I think, ought to have been laid before the house under the orders already given, which would save time and trouble; if not, it must be the subject of a particular motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00725"><member>Lord Castlereagh</member><membercontribution> had no objection to the production of the papers the hon. gent, had referred to, but was sorry the hon. gent, had introduced other circumstances that were not necessarily connected with the motion. The observations he had thrown out respecting the defeat of that unfortunate detachment went, the house would feel, to involve the character of an officer, whose conduct was now the subject of military inquiry. But, considering this event in a more general view, he did not see that it afforded so much room for complaint as the hon. gent. would, have us believe. Great successes had been obtained in other quarters, which much more than counterbalanced that unfortunate circumstance. The hon. gent, had also gone out of his way in the observations he had made respecting the territories that had been ceded as indemnities, and the sums granted to a prince of the Guzzerat. These, the noble lord thought, would come more properly under discussion when the India budget should be submitted to the house. He had no objection, however, that the house should be in possession of all the information the hon. gent. could wish. Indeed, the qualification the hon. gent, himself had annexed to his motion, removed every objection that could be made to it, as he wishes only to have such papers as may not interfere with the arrangements of govt. or put them in an awkward predicament in regard to the quarter from which they may have received secret information.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00726"><member>Mr. Francis.</member><membercontribution> I beg leave to assure the house that I had no thoughts of reflecting
<image src="S1V0003P0I0040"/>
<col>51</col>
on the officer to whose misfortune I have alluded. I do not even know his name, nor is it possible that any thing said of him, at this time and at this distance, can affect his situation or character in India. My sole object in mentioning the fact was to justify the motion, and to exculpate myself from having intruded on the house without a strong case, or without sufficient reason.&#x2014;The question was then put and agreed to.&#x2014;Adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[INSOLVENT DEBTORS BILL.]&#x2014;</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00727">After several private bills were forwarded in their respective stages, and some routine business disposed of, their lordships, pursuant to the order of the day, resolved into a committee on the insolvent debtors' amended bill, lord Walsingham in the chair.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00728"><member>Lord Ellenborugh</member><membercontribution> rose and stated, that in consequence of a gross misrepresentation of the nature and object of the present bill, which had been allowed to go abroad, he found it necessary, both for the public information, and that those unfortunate persons who might suppose that they were meant to be relieved by the bill might not be deceived, or entertain false hopes, to explain the whole extent of the object which he had in view, in submitting this bill to their lordships' consideration. The bill now on their lordships' table, was not meant to extend in the most distant degree the benefits of the act of last session to any persons not expressly and in the true spirit and meaning of the act, comprehended in the bill passed last session. In fact, the insertion of a single word, or rather of a single letter ("prisons" for "prison") into that act, would; have rendered the present bill unnecessary. From the whole tenor of the act, it was evident that its benefits were meant to be extended to all persons, not otherwise disqualified, who had been in prison previous to the 1st Jan. 1804, and still continued there. Yet, by the wording of the oath required to be made by the jailors of the different prisons, with the list of prisoners in their custody, it is narrowed in such a manner as to seem to apply merely to persons who, during the period specified in the act, have been in that individual prison of which the person making the return is jailor. To rectify this narrowed interpretation of the act, and to give it the full scope which its other clauses imported
<col>52</col>
it was meant to convey, was the sole object of the present bill. In the court in which his lordship presided, numberless applications had been made by persons who had been in prison during the full period required by the act, praying for a mandamus on the keepers of the different prisons, to rectify their lists, according to the different circumstances of the cases which presented themselves. But, after the most deliberate consideration, and after a consultation of all the judges on the subject, it had been deemed beyond the power of a court of justice to afford that relief which, they were nevertheless convinced, it was in the contemplation of the legislature to have bestowed. Persons who had been in prison, probably in the Fleet, previous to the 1st of Jan. 1804, and had afterwards been removed by <i>habeas corpus to the King's Bench,</i> or <i>vice versa,</i> it was obvious from the whole tenor of the act, of parliament, were not meant, merely on account of such removal, to be excluded from the benefit of the act; yet, on the other hand, it was impossible for the keeper of any particular prison to swear, as was required by the act, that a person so removed had been in his custody during the whole of the period specified, nor could any court of justice so far annul an act of parliament as to dispense with so special an enactment. In this situation, he had thought it his duty to endeavour to procure the earliest possible relief to unfortunate persons in the predicament he had mentioned. He was in his place on the day of the meeting of Parliament, had it been competent then to have brought forward the measure. He had been applied to by gentlemen desirous of extending the benefits of the act to persons not at present comprehended under it: but, however much he might have been disposed to concur in any measure of the kind, he could not conceive it proper to clog with such a burden the present bill, which was meant only to supply an omission, and to place persons in the way of profiting by the act who already clearly fell under its spirit and meaning, but were prevented, by the wording of a particular clause, from availing themselves of its privileges. He therefore hoped no delay would be suffered to take place in giving effect to the present bill, by engrafting on it measures with which it was totally unconnected.&#x2014;The bill then went through a committee without any amendment, and was reported.&#x2014;Adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

Cavendish, esq. who had accepted the office of steward or bailiff of the three Chiltern Hundreds of Stoke, Desborough, and Bonenham, in the county of Buckingham, was issued, directed to the sheriff of York, and which was, on the 23d of July last, delivered to James Fox, esq. then sheriff of the same county of York, who thereupon issued his precept, directed to the bailiffs of the said borough of Knaresborough, the said bailiffs being the returning officers of said borough, requiring them forthwith to cause a burgess to be elected for the said borough, in the place of the said W. Cavendish, esq. according to the command of the said writ; and which precept was on the 23d of July delivered to John Carr, one of the bailiffs of the said borough; and that, on the 25th of the same month of July, James Collins, the other bailiff of the said borough, together with the said John Carr, did cause proclamation to be made, on the Market Cross in Knaresborough, that the election would be proceeded in on Monday the 30th of the same month of July, at 11 o'clock in the forenoon, at the Tolbooth there; and that the petitioners, and several other persons having, or claiming to have, a right to vote for members of the said borough, were proceeding to the Tolbooth on the morning of the said 30th of July, in order to give their votes at the said election; but in consequence of a very great riot arid tumult, raised by a very large number of persons, who were not electors for the said borough, and in consequence of violent assaults and ill-treatment committed on several of the electors, and on the magistrates and constables intended to keep order at the said election, and by blocking up the passage to the Tolbooth at the said borough, and preventing the bailiffs, magistrates, and electors, from entering the same, the said election could

not be proceeded in; and that the said bailiffs made the following return to the sheriff of the said county of York, who transmitted the same to the clerk of the crown, annexed to the writ where it is now filed, "We the bailiffs of the borough of Knares-borough, in the county of York, having received the precept of the sheriff of the said county for the election of a member for the said borough, hi the place of William Cavendish, esq. did, on the 25th of July inst. make a proclamation at the Market Cross in Knaresborough aforesaid, that the election would be proceeded in on the day of the date hereof, at eleven, o'clock in the forenoon, in the Tolbooth there: that, in pursuance of the said proclamation, we attempted to proceed to such election with the assistance of sir John Ingilby, bart a magistrate for the West Riding of the said county, and of 20 special constables, but were unable to get to the court room by the violence of a mob, consisting of several hundred people, who had previously obtained possession of the stairs leading thereto, headed and instigated by the following persons, namely, J. M. Allen, attorney at law, R. Dewes, an ensign in the Kuaresborough volunteer infantry, R. Walker, half-pay quarter-master in his majesty's forces, T. Abbot, Serjeant of a volunteer corps of cavalry, W. Whitehead, corporal of a volunteer corps of infantry, M. Lewty, J. Turnbull, and W.

Charles Knowlton, clerk, two other magistrates for the said West Riding, finding that it would not only endanger the lives of themselves, the returning officers, and voters, it they attempted to proceed in the election, or read the riot act, but would be absolutely useless, as there were no soldiers nearer than the barracks at York, being 20 miles from this place, except the volunteers of Knaresborough, several of

<title>PAPERS RELATIVE TO THE DISCUSSION WITH SPAIN IN 1803, AND 1804, PRESENTED BY HIS MAJESTY'S COMMAND TO BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, 24th JAN. 1805.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00740">No. 1&#x2014;<i>Extract of a Dispatch from Ld.</i> Hawkesbury to J. H. Frere, Esq. duted Downing-Street, June 2, 1803. I shall new proceed to signify to you his majesty's pleasure with respect to the conduct which it will be proper for you to observe at the court at which you reside.&#x2014;It is the king's sincere and earnest desire that the Spanish govt. may be enabled to maintain the strictest neutrality in the war which has commenced between G. Britain and France. You will therefore endeavour, by all the means in your power, to impress upon the Spanish ministers the expediency of their adopting this system; and you will assure them, that, if it be adopted, his majesty will respect it with the most scrupulous good faith.&#x2014;His majesty's govt. having no means of deciding how far his Catholic majesty may consider himself as bound by the treaty of defensive and offensive alliance which was concluded at St. Hdefonso on the 19th Aug. 1796, it is indispensably necessary that you should lose no time in ascertaining this important point. If the Spanish govt. should
<col>62</col>
State to you, that they conceive themselves to be under the obligation to furnish to France the number of troops and ships which are stipulated in the treaty above mentioned, but that their co-operation will extend no further, you will refrain; from giving any opinion upon this measure, but will content yourself with signifying that you will transmit the information of it to your court. You will, however, watch, with the most unremitting vigilance, the progress of any preparations which may be made for carrying it into execution; and you will, from time to time, transmit such intelligence as you may be able to acquire upon the subject, to the commanders of his majesty's ships in the Mediterranean, at Gibraltar, and at Lisbon, in order that those officers may be enabled to pursue such measures as may be best calculated to intercept the Spanish auxiliary ships, on their attempting to sail from the ports either of the Mediterranean or of the Atlantic; a proceeding which would be in strict conformity to the most rigid principles of neutrality, and could not be construed into an act of direct aggression against Spain herself.&#x2014;If, however, you should learn from the Spanish ministers, that the French govt. will not be satisfied with the definite succours stipulated, but will require his Catholic majesty to place a greater proportion of his naval and military force at the disposition of France, you will state to them, unreservedly, that his majesty will consider a compliance with this requisition as equivalent to a declaration of war, and as justifying his majesty in proceeding to immediate hostilities against Spain.&#x2014;The next object to which his majesty has commanded me to direct your particular attention, is the situation of Portugal. It is extremely important that you should take the earliest opportunity to desire the Spanish govt. to explain to you, without reserve, their sentiments and intentions in this respect. In any conversations which you may have with the Spanish ministers upon this subject, you will observe to them, that his majesty having consented to respect the neutrality of Portugal himself, he cannot suffer it to be molested by any other power whatsoever; he relies upon the justice and magnanimity of his Catholic majesty, that he will neither of himself, nor in "concurrence with France, Carry into execution any measures which may endanger the security and independence of that country. You will, however, not conceal from the Spanish ministry, that if the King of Spain should allow the entrance of any French troops into his territories, or
<image src="S1V0003P0I0046"/>
<col>63</col>
should not resist it by force, the king would consider it as imposing upon him the necessity of regarding the conduct of Spain as a justifiable ground of war on his part. In regard to Portugal, I have still further to signify to you his majesty s pleasure, that you cultivate the most cordial understanding with the minister of that power at Madrid, and that you concur with him in promoting the security of her Faithful majesty's dominions.&#x2014;Having now stated to you such proceedings on the part of Spain, as would render it expedient for his majesty to commence hostilities against that power, I have to signify to you his majesty's pleasure, that if any of these events should occur, you should make the strongest representations against them, and, in the case of your not receiving a satisfactory answer, you will immediately quit Madrid, and proceed to Lisbon, whence you will return to England. Previously to your departure, you will apprize the officers commanding his majesty's ships in the Mediterranean, at Lisbon, and at Gibraltar, of your intention, in order that they may proceed to hostilities against Spain without delay.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00741">No. 2.&#x2014;<i>Extract of a Dispatch from J. H. Frere, Esq. to 14. Hawkesbury, dated Aranjuez, 3d June 1803.</i> Upon a former occasion I had pressed the Prince of Peace to an explicit declaration of the intentions of his court, upon the ground that, under the conditions of the 8th Art. of the Treaty of St. lldefonso, the hostility of Spain was so inseparably connected with that of France, that G. Brit, once engaged in a war with France, would be justified in commencing immediate hostilities against Spain. To this he replied, that it might appear so; but that the execution of treaties must not be considered as absolutely indispensable, but dependent upon the circumstances of the times; and with some other expressions of the same kind, seemed to wish me to understand that be did not consider the present situation of things as admitting the execution of the treaty. Upon this occasion he took a new and very perplexed ground; 1st, he said he wished to know the grounds of the present dispute, whether it was to be considered as the continuation of the former war, as in that case Spain would not take any part; but that if it was a new war upon new grounds, she might in that case be forced to consider the treaty as obligatory; 'that it was necessary, therefore, upon this head to know the opinion of the other powers concerned in the Treaty of Amiens. He continued to say, that the King of Spain had
<col>64</col>
not entered into the last war as the ally of France in virtue of that treaty. I quoted the last art. which is directed particularly against England, and which he seemed not to recollect; and seeing no end to th discussion at the time, I determined in my next conference to return to it. In my next interview, however, he anticipated me, and, on my first coming into the room, he said, "Well, it seems we are to have war." I said, that I hoped that by we, he did not mean Spain and England. He answered, No; that Spain was determined to preserve her neutrality. I replied, that if they were determined upon a neutrality, it only remained for us to know whether we agreed in our idea of neutrality, and whether they would consider the granting permission for the passage of French troops as included, in their definition of it. I added, that the means of guaranteeing and securing that neutrality must be concerted with G. Brit. Here he again declined entering into the discussion, and referred me to official communications with Mr. Cevauos. I accordingly prepared the inclosed note, which I confined purposely to the simple question of the interpretation of the Treaty of St. lldefonso.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00742"><i>Translation qflnclosure referred to in No* 2, dated Aranjuez, 3d June, 1803.</i> Sir, The present situation of affairs, being of a nature to render an explanation between our two governments necessary, I find myself called upon to address myself directly to your excellency, not doubting, that, in consequence of the friendly sentiments which your excl. has already done me the honor to declare to me on the part of his Catholic majesty, I shall find in your exc.'s explanations the same frankness which I think it my duty to employ in those which I have the honor to submit to you.&#x2014;The court of Spain being connected with France by a recent treaty, which renders it liable to be called upon for its co-operation by the simple requisition of that'power; your excl. will doubtless perceive, that the literal construction of, and formal adhesion to this stipulation would to identify Spain with France (at least with regard to its hostile relations) as to render a state of warfare with the latter sufficient to constitute Spain in a state of hostility with the power at war with France; would even authorize that power to consider in the first instance as an enemy, a power, whose hostile efforts, depending solely on the will of a declared enemy, would only war a convenient moment foraction.&#x2014; Your excl. will do me the justice to believe, that I am far from reflecting on this idea

with satisfaction, and that if I dwell upon it, it is solely in order to repeat to your excl. in a more formal manner, the assurances which I have already had the honor to make verbally; namely, that his majesty's govt. has no intention whatever of giving such a construction in the first instance to the art. of the Treaty of St. lldefonso, or to pursue a step founded upon the reasoning (in other respects just and conclusive), which I have just, pointed out. I would then endeavour to make your excl. Sensible, that, notwithstanding the just value I attach to the indirect declarations which your excl. has already made me, as to the amicable and pacific intentions of his Catholic majesty, nevertheless, in consideration of the existence of a recent and formal treaty, the stipulations of which are incompatible with the execution of the intentions which I have just quoted, it would be important and even necessary, that the Brit. govt. should receive from that of Spain a declaration, the formality and' authenticity of which should be capable of removing the distrust, which her ancient connexion and existing trea;ies with the enemy of G. Brit, might naturally inspire.&#x2014;It only remains for rac to express to your excl. the anxious solicitude with which await your answer, and to repeat the assurances, &amp;c. J. H. FRERE.

Brit, are not conformable to the stipulations of the treaty of Amiens, and that France has not thought herself able to subscribe to them without the concurrence of Spain and Holland, as contracting parties, and of Austria, Russia, and Russia, as guarantees of that treaty: that in such circumstances, nothing would have been more conformable to the reciprocal relations resulting from a treaty; to the principles which constitute its force; and to the legal means of dissolving it; than that G. Brit, should have explained her wishes to the king, my master, in so far at least, as being a principal in the treaty of Amiens, he is concerned in the observance of the articles which compose it. And lastly, that his maj. being, as I have observed, in want of all official and authentic information upon the state of the negotiations, which is necessary for returning a proper answer upon the weighty question treated of in your note, he can take no resolution Without this indispensable information, which you may be able to furnish me, by asking of your govt. for that purpose, a relation of the progress and termination of the negotiation.

Frere, Esq. to Don Pedro cevallos, dated Madrid,</i> 10th June, Sir; I lose no time in answering your excl.'s note of yesterday's date. In order not to importune your excl. by an idle and useless discussion, it had appeared to me necessary to propose to you a previous question, resulting from the existence of the public treaties between his Catholic maj. and the Fr. Republic; namely, to know whether his Catholic maj.'s govt, still considered itself as bound by the letter of the treaty of St. Hdefonso, and particularly by that of the 8th. art. the effect of which absolutely identifies the two govts. in the event of hostilities.&#x2014; Notwithstanding the confidence with which his Britannic maj. would have submitted to
<image src="S1V0003P0I0048"/>
<col>67</col>
his Catholic maj.'s equity, and to the discernment of his govt. so just a cause as that which involves him in the present hostilities, it would have appeared to me superfluous to lay before the court of Spain an explanation of his maj.'s motives, if indeed it was true that this court did not retain the right to demand a similar explanation from its ally, nor to act according to the decision which its own principles of justice might suggest; if, even in doing justice to the conduct of the Brit. govt. it should nevertheless feel itself obliged to take up arms in support of a cause which it had acknowledged to be unjust. &#x2014; As it is impossible that these considerations can have escaped the penetration of your excl. it is with real satisfaction that I perceived, by your note, that the court of Spain expects some farther explanations on the nature of the discussions which have subsisted between England and France, before it could decide on the part which it should take in the war which has terminated them. I accept i: as a proof that Spain feels she still bas a free choice; and, as such, I stall not delay transmitting it to my govt. not doubting, but that as soon as it shall be informed of these dispositions of his Catholic maj. I shall be authorized to give him the most satisfactory explanations on the considerations which have determined his majesty again to take up arms against France, and which cannot make any alteration in the sincere desire with which he is animated to maintain and increase more and more the bonds of friendship and good understanding already established between the two countries. And if such instructions have not yet been transmitted to me, your excl. will feel, from what I have just mentioned, that this delay cannot be imputed, either to an unwillingness on his Brit, maj.'s part to concert with the court of Spain those measures, which he has never ceased to pursue, for the preservation of peace, or still less to a fear of not being able to justify in the eye of his Catholic maj. the decision which he found himself at last obliged to take. Your excl. will find the motive of it in the nature of the political relations of your court, and in the impossibility there existed of submitting to it discussions, in which its connexions with France did not permit k to have a voice, unless Spain should free herself from those laws she had imposed on herself, and should claim that right of free judgment, which a nation only loses with its independence.

Sir; I have just received accounts, of the accuracy of which I cannot doubt, informing me of the preparations made by the Spanish govt. to facilitate the passage of a considerable body of marines and artillery-men destined to reinforce the French fleet now at Ferrol.&#x2014;The instructions with which my court has furnished me for my conduct in the event of French troops entering the Spanish territory, are so clear and positive, and the present case is so analogous thereto, that I have little doubt of the light in which this proceeding will be looked upon by my govt. and at the same time that I hasten to communicate it to you, I must protest, in the most formal manner, against such a flagrant breach of the neutrality of Spain.&#x2014;It would probably be superfluous, in this place, to attempt to do justice to the scrupulous respect which the officers of his Brit. maj. have shewn for the Spanish territory, since your excl. is already well convinced, that such is the intention of the govt. under which they serve. I cannot, however, refrain from quoting a recent instance, in which, during the heat of the pursuit, and even on the very point of capturing the prize, the English fleet respected the neutrality of the Spanish coast, and permitted an enemy's frigate to take refuge in the very port: whence by means of the succours which arrive there from France, she will put to sea for the purpose of combating that same fleet.&#x2014;It has been the constant object of all my efforts, to cause this govt. to feel the real interest it has in-preserving the friendship and good understanding which subsists between the two crowns. His maj. has already proved to the whole world, by a moderation uuex-ampled, the high price which he attaches to this system, and which he wm continue to attach to it, as long as he shaft see any hope of a reciprocal disposition on the part of Spain; but I dare not believe that he will see with difference a conduct so little conformable

to his own, or that he can acknowledge the neutrality of that power, whose ports shall have become, not the asylum, but the dock yards and arsenals of his enemy. I avail myself, &amp;c. J. H. FRERE.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00748">No. 5.&#x2014;<i>Extract of a dispatch front Lit. Havkeibury to J. H. Frere Esq. dated Downing Street,</i> 24<i>th Nov.</i> 1803. Your dispatches to No. 40. inclusive have been received, and laid before the king. I have great satisfaction in communicating to you his maj. entire approbation of the line of conduct which you have adopted, and the language which you have held in your different conversations with the Spanish ministers. In the uncertainty which appears yet to prevail, whether any treaty or convention has actually been concluded between Fr. and Spain, and what are the precise conditions of such treaty or convention, it is extremely difficult for me to give you any instructions which must not be dependent upon circumstances, of the particulars of which his maj. is not yet correctly informed.&#x2014;The preservation of peace with Spain has, from the period of the commencement of the present war, been the constant object of his maj. policy; but the Spanish govt. must themselves feel, that this object can only be attained by their earnest endeavours to do every thing which depends upon them for the maintenance of a fair system of neutrality, and by their causing that neutrality to be respected by the other belligerent powers. When the question, therefore, occurs, how fat his maj. would consent that the Spanish govt. should purchase their neutrality by an advance of pecuniary succours to the Fr. govt. and would still regard them in the character of neutrals, this must be considered as, in some degree, depending on the amount of the succours so to be advanced, and likewise On the determination of the Span. Govt. to ensure, their neutrality in all other respects; for, at the time when his maj. might be disposed to disregard any small or temporary advance of money, if essential to the attainment of such an object, it would be impossible for him to consider a permanent advance to the extent of that stated by you, in any other light than as a subsidy to the Fr. govt. and as possibly the most effectual assistance which the Span. govt. could afford them for the prosecution of the war.&#x2014;In the event of your being convinced that any arrangement of the nature alluded to by you has been concluded between thcSpa&#x2014;nish at Fr. govts. or of your having reason to believe that such an arrangement, if not absolutely concluded, is likely to take place, you will conform yourself to the following instructions: 1st. you will protest against the measure, as a violation of neutrality on
<col>70</col>
the part of Spain, and as consequently a justifiable cause of war on the part of his maj. 2nd. You will explain distinctly that his maj. can only be induced to abstain from immediate hostilities, in consequence of such a measure, upon the consideration that it is a temporary expedient from which the Spanish govt. arc determined to extricate themselves as soon as possible, and that his maj. must be at liberty to consider a perseverance in the system of furnishing succours to France, as, at any future period, when circumstances may render it necessary, a just cause of war. &#x2014;3rd.His maj. expects that the Spanish govt. will persevere in their intention of refusing the admission of any Fr. troops into the Spanish territories:&#x2014;4th. Any measures taken by the Spanish govt. towards naval preparation, must be considered, under the present circumstances, as objects of the greatest jealousy, and any attempt to furnish naval succours to France as an immediate cause of war. &#x2014;,5th. His maj. has a right to expect, not only that tie ports of Spain should be open to the commerce of his subjects, but that his ships of war, and the ships of his subjects, shall receive the same treatment as those of his enemies.&#x2014;These are the instructions which you will adopt for the regulation of your conduct. In the event of a Fr. army entering the Spanish territories, or of authentic information being received of any naval succours being in preparation for the purpose of affording assistance to his maj. enemies, you will consider your mission as at an end; and after the proper official communications, you will leave Madrid.&#x2014;In the event of your being under the necessity of leaving Madrid, you will give previous notice to the commanders of his maj. forces in the mediterranean, at Gibraltar, at Lisbon, and off Ferrol, that they may procceed without delay to measures of hostility.</p>

The instructions which I had the honour of receiving from your ldp. by the messenger Basset, were received by me with the Highest gratitude for the gracious expressions of his maj. approbation of my conduct; and with no less satisfaction on account of the precise and detailed rules laid down for my guidance, and their fortunate adaptation to the state of things in this country-at the present juncture.&#x2014;M. Cevallos had for some time answered all my representations with an air of so much satisfaction and superior information, that I was almost fearful that, in the warmth with which I had urged the several topics, which are pointed out in your ldp's dispatch, I

<col>71</col>
might hare gone beyond the feeling of his maj.'s govt. &#x2014;When I received your Idp's. dispatch, I made it the subject of a note to M. Cevallos as plain and short as the subject would admit, and almost entirely copied from your ldp's instructions.&#x2014;On the following day I called upon M. Cevallos, and, in speaking on the subject of the note, observed to him that I trusted he would now do justice to the intentions which had dictated the language I had formerly held to him, when he saw its precise conformity with the instructions which I had received from my court. M. Cevallos went into a long dissertation upon neutrality, and a recapitulation of the sacrifices, as he called them, which the king of Spain had made to preserve a neutrality. I answered with the obvious arguments which I do not now repeat, as they are nearly the same as those contained in a note which I have since delivered, and which your ldp. will find enclosed. M. Cevallos answered, that his Catholic Maj. had done everything in his power to preserve a neutrality, and that if his endeavours failed it would not be his fault, but that of his maj's govt. who would be responsible in the eyes of Europe. To this I replied, that Europe would certainly judge which of the two govts. was in the right, and that I conceived, that G. Brit, had little to apprehend from such a judgment; and that what he called a neutrality, was in fact a subsidy, which the French would, whenever they pleased, convert into active co-operation, by making a passage through this country into Portugal; an event which the late convention did not provide against, and which they knew, and had been repeatedly warned, that England would consider as a breach of neutrality on the part of Spain.&#x2014;After closing this part of the subject M. Cevallos questioned me in return, and desired me to tell him positively, whether the affording the pecuniary succours to France would be considered as a ground of war, and whether I was authorized to declare it? to this i answered distinctly that I was; and that a war would be the infallible consequence. In that case, said he, his Maj. is bound by solemn treaties, which he cannot depart from; but if the pecuniary succours are themselves thought a motive for war by G. Brit, the ground of our engagement is altered. I answered, that it was not the wish of England to crush Spun, and still less to crush her in favour of France; that it could answer no purpose that Spain should exhaust herself by first furnishing a subsidy and afterwards a contingent; and that if he wished therefore to have a clearer and more distinct declaration than that contained in my note of the
<col>72</col>
day before, I would give it him. He said he thought that was unnecessary, that the note was strong enough.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00750">(<i>Translation of first inclosure in No. 6.</i>) Note from J. H. Frere Esq. to D. P. Cevallos, dated, Escuriol, 18th Dec. 1803&#x2014;Sir, I obey the orders which I have just received from my court, by transmitting to your excl. in an authentic shape, the declarations which have frequently had the honour of making verbally, and in a manner less positive and precise.&#x2014;Since the commencement of hostilities, his Maj. has never ceased to consider the preservation of good understanding with Spain as a principal object of his political views. This court, indeed, has never refused to acknowledge the justice of his maj.'s intentions and good will towards it. But it is equally manifest, and the court of Spain itself cannot but admit it, that the effect of this good will, and of these intentions, must depend upon that of the efforts which Spain is bound to make on her side; in the first place, to maintain a system of absolute neutrality, and, secondly, to cause it to be respected by the other belligerent powers.&#x2014;With regard to the former, his maj. is perfectly sensible of the difficulties of the situation in which Spain is placed, as well by reason of her ancient ties with France, as on account of the character and habitual conduct of that power, and of her chief. This consideration would induce him to act with forbearance to a certain degree, and particularly to overlook such pecuniary sacrifices, as should not be of sufficient magnitude to force attention on account of their political effects. But it is expressly enjoined me to declare to your excl. that pecuniary advances, such as are stipulated in the convention recently concluded with France, cannot be considered by the Brit. govt. but as a war subsidy; a succour the most efficacious, the best adapted to the wants and to the situation of the enemy, the most prejudicial to the interests of his Brit, maj.'s subjects, and the most dangerous for his dominions; in fine, more than equivalent to every other species of aggression.&#x2014;Notwithstanding his personal sentiments, imperious necessity, and that first duty which compels a prince to consider, above and before all things, the nation whose interests are committed to his care, have prescribed to his maj. that conduct from which he cannot depart.&#x2014;With regard to the 2nd art. that of causing this neutrality robe respected by the other belligerent powers, it appears superfluous to repeat to your excl. the declarations which I have already made on the subject of Portugal; nevertheless, since this object is again pointed out in. my last instructions, I cannot refrain from re-

peating to your excl. the declaration, that the passage of Er. troops through the territories of Spain would be considered as a violation of her neutrality, and that his maj. would find himself compelled to have recourse to the most decisive measures, in consequence of such an event. Such, sir, is an abridgment of the instructions which I have just received from my court, and which I communicate nearly in the same terms. There arc others, of inferior importance, upon which I shall have the honour to converse with you in the conference of to-morrow.&#x2014;Whilst I attach the utmost importance to these interesting subjects, it affords me much satisfaction to think that your excl. will at length be persuaded that I have been far from exceeding the views and sentiments of my govt. in the declarations which I have formerly made, and that the advice which I have thought it right, in consequence, to suggest, has been founded upon ideas sufficiently correct, and inspired by the sincerest desire of perpetuating the continuance of harmony and good understanding between the two countries. I have the honor, &amp; c. J. H. FRERE.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00751">(<i>Second Inclosure in No. 6.</i>)&#x2014;<i>Translation of a Note from Don Pedro Cevallas to J. H. Frere, Esq. dated Escurial, l6th Dec. 1803.</i> Sir; As soon as the war began between France and England, Spain was required by the former power to furnish the defensive succours stipulated by the treaty of 1796, the execution of which, in as much as if is a consequence of engagements previously contracted by Spain, and a fresh proof of the king's good faith, presents in no degree an obstacle to the continuance of friendship and good understanding with G. Britain, with whom his maj. has endeavoured to maintain them by every means of conciliation, G. Brit, corresponding to the same object, by punishing the privateers who transgress the law of neutrality, according to repeated official accounts, and chiefly those of the 29th Nov. a later date than the expedition of the courier who has given rise to the note which you have just sent me.&#x2014; Although the Spanish cabinet is penetrated with the maxim, that the idea of aiding France is compatible with that of neutrality towards England, his maj. has thought that he could better maintain these two objects by a method, which, without being disagreeable to France, strips her neutrality towards G. Brit, of that hostile exterior which military succours necesarily present, which sometimes, in spite of friendly protestations, leads the minds of neutral sovereigns to mistrust, to the hazard of the wished-for peace. Such have been the king's political views in
<col>74</col>
agreeing to a treaty of subsidy to France, equivalent to the military succour. Neither before nor since this treaty has the Spanish govt. omitted any of those means which lead to the preservation of good understanding with G. Britain, as is proved to you by the imprisonment inflicted upon the Spaniard who dared to insult the British flag.&#x2014;Tbe British cabinet in its conferences with the Spanish minister, has not considered that Spain violated her neutrality by the act of assisting France with the military succour stipulated for her defence.&#x2014;The pecuniary aid substituted in its place, besides that it carries no hostile appearance, neither compromises the good understanding of those who are neuter, nor gives to France such ready and expeditious means of hostility against G. Brit.&#x2014;The king has employed his offices with the French govt. to avoid the entry of her troops into Spain, and to calm the apprehensions of the court of Portugal, obtaining from the first consul that this point should become an object of negotiation between the two governments, and his maj. offering to co-operate with his good offices for the conclusion of a treaty which is to shelter the kingdom of Portugal from any attack; the favourable effects of which that monarchy has already begun to feel, and it is in her power to derive from it all the advantage which site desires.&#x2014;In this situation of things I receive your note, which represents that Spain, in having substituted pecuniary supplies for her defensive engagements, has displeased the English cabinet in a degree the most unexpected, under pretext that they exceed her engagements; whereas to represent them under this point of view, it would be necessary to know their amount, which is not known; or knowing it, to compare it with the expence of furnishing the defensive succours due to France.&#x2014;This comparative statement of what has been hitherto executed by Spain, and the contents of your note, and what is more the contradiction which there is between the equitable and conciliatory conduct of G. Brit, in sentencing to punishment the privateers who have violated the Spanish flag, according to the accounts of the 29th Nov. and the alarming expressions in which your note of the 13th inst. is conceived, obliges the Spanish cabinet to require of you more clear and decisive explanations of the ideas of your cabinet, which I hope you will be pleased to communicate to me with the dispatch which their importance demands.</p>

<col>75</col>
<i>Cerallos, dated Madrid, 26th Dec.</i> 1803.&#x2014; Sir; I comply with your excl.'s request, in communicating to you the explicit and decisive explanations of the ideas of my cabinet, mentioned in my note of the 13th inst. They are nearly the same with those which I had the honor verbally to address to you in our conference on this subject. Your excl. then remarked, and the same observation again occurs in your note of the l6th inst. that the furnishing the succours stipulated by the treaty of 1796, being but a consequence of engagements previously contracted, is in fact only a fresh proof of the good faith of his catholic maj. and can in no wise be prejudicial to the continuance of good harmony with his Brit, maj.&#x2014;I confess to your excl. that without having too favorable an opinion of my own abilities, I could not nevertheless help feeling a degree of humiliation, on seeing that a person, whose judgment I infinitely respected, set so little a value on mine; and that he thought he might hazard with me a sophism, from which, if the gravity of the subject could allow of it, it would not be difficult to draw the most absurd consequences.&#x2014;In fact, it remains to be known, whether a power can acquire the right of attacking another, and at the same time impose on her the obligation to abstain from every species of reprisals. It cannot surely be necessary seriously to discuss a similar question: it suffices simply to say, that such a right cannot exist; that nature and common sense reject it; that all political combinations are inadequate to bestow it; and that most certainly no nation can acquire it by an act of its own judgment, such as the signature of a treaty concluded voluntarily, and without necessity.&#x2014;But, it may be asked, should not the stipulations of a treaty be complied with? I do not examine, if in the present case the stipulations of the treaty, which binds Spain to France, have not been annulled by reiterated acts of this very power. It may be granted that this treaty is of the utmost validity; it may even be admitted that it is most strictly obligatory; and that the Spanish govt. is bound to execute most scrupulously all its articles; but after all these concessions, it remains for me on the other hand to remark, that this obligation is absolutely foreign to G. Brit, and that its govt. is not bound to respect the execution of a treaty, to which it has been far from contributing, which has been made without its knowledge, against its consent, and even in opposition to its power. An individual who yesterday was free, enters to-day a volunteer, to-morrow he receives orders to
<col>76</col>
march to the attack of a place; his honor and his engagement oblige him to fulfil his duty; but he would be in the wrong to suppose that this obligation ought to be respected by the besieged, or that it will protect him against the natural consequences of a vigorous resistance. If in fact any misfortune should befal him, he ought to consider it solely as the consequence of the engagement he had entered into&#x2014;The same reason applies to the substitution of pecuniary subsidies, and still more strongly, if these subsidies, by their amount, of by the effect of other circumstances, become more than an equivalent for the stipulated contingent; but in the present case, France has shewn a marked eagerness to obtain this substitution; the court of England has lately declared, in a formal manner, that it considers such a substitution as more prejudicial than would be the supplying the contingent itself. These two govts. are assuredly the best and only judges of what is conducive to their respective interests: and their opinions, so unequivocally declared, render it unnecessary for me to reply to your excl.'s arguments. There still remains one remark more to be made on this subject; and your excl. will the more readily pardon me, as it may in some degree be considered as necessary to my personal justification. When your excl. expresses to me the surprize which the declaration I made on the 13th of this month had caused, you will allow me to call to your recollection, that this declaration merely contained the formal expression of the same ideas and of the same language which I had held on every occasion when I had the honor of speaking to you on the subject of the enormous subsidies lately demanded by France. It was perhaps natural, that your excl. should at that time have referred to other information, rather than to verbal assurances on my part. I certainly regret it; but neither my govt. nor myself can be responsible for it. With respect to that part of your excl.'s note, which says, that the Brit, cabinet, in its conferences with the Spanish minister, was not of opinion that Spain infringed its neutrality by affording the stipulated succours, it appears to me no easy task to understand clearly the precise force of the expression made use of by your excl. in the original; but if I am to understand it, as alluding to any declaration whatever on this subject on the part of his maj.'s ministers, I will venture to take upon myself, under the most formal responsibility, to deny the existence of such a declaration.&#x2014;Net to omit any thing on the several points con-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0053"/>
<col>77</col>
tained in your excl.'s note, it will be necessary to say a word on the subject of Portugal. At the very commencement of hostilities, I obeyed the orders of my court, by declaring both to your exc. and to mon signeur the prince of peace, that his maj. in pursuance of his alliance with the court of Portugal, found himself obliged to consider the non-passage of the French troops through the Spanish territories as indispensable to the maintenance of the neutrality of that court. It appears then, that in a convention, the ostensible and acknowledged design of which were to secure the tranquillity of Spain, it would have been natural to introduce an article that might secure her against a similar infraction of her neutrality; it being manifest, that such an infraction would determine the Brit. govt. no longer to consider Spain as a neutral power. On the contrary it appears, that the treaty contains only one art by which Spain engages herself to interpose her good offices with Portugal, in order to prevail upon her also to furnish France with a subsidy against her own ally. I have just stated to your excl. the sentiments of my court on the granting of these subsidies by Spain, in reply to your excl.'s arguments, which dwelt solely upon the existence of prior treaties. It may therefore be permitted me to remind your excl. that Portugal is bound by prior treaties to furnish succours to England. That Portugal has no neutrality to purchase: That if Portugal is to conform to the system adopted by Spain, that is to say, the substitution of pecuniary succours for a contingent, these succours are due to England. If, on the contrary, her neutrality is to be purchased by furnishing succours to the enemy of her ally, as is now proposed to Portugal to do, it would thence result that Spain should likewise furnish succours to England, and not to France; if Spain should reject such a demand as an insult, the ought not to endeavour to induce Portugal to submit to it. Two opposite principles can never be admitted in two cases precisely similar. Let not insinuations, founded on a pretended disparity between the forces of the two Belligerent powers, be put in opposition to this just and natural consequence! Such considerations have not been admitted by England. She has, by a Solemn defiance, proved the falsehood of the vain and groundless assertion, that England was unable to cope single-handed with France. She has given this defiance. She will maintain it, or she will fall gloriously. Never will she admit the idea of an humiliating inferiority, either as the basis of her own conduct, or of her relations with foreign
<col>78</col>
powers. Too well I know the respect which is due to a great and powerful monarchy, to dwell upon injurious comparisons, especially in an official and permanent form: But your excl. will doubtless recollect the observations which I have verbally made to you respecting the relative situations of Portugal and Spain, with regard to France and England. If I do not think it proper to repeat them on this occasion, I can assure your excl. that I am far from concealing them, or from apprehending that they can be disavowed by my govt.&#x2014;It appears to me, that the above statement will answer your excl.'s ideas: but I cannot close it without affording myself the satisfaction of rendering justice to the upright and friendly intentions of his Catholic maj. manifested on several occasions, and almost uniformly in your excl.'s language and conduct.&#x2014; Your excl. has likewise afforded the same testimony in favour of the principles and conduct of his Brit, maj.'s govt. Such is, unfortunately, the temper of mankind, that rivalry and hatred are not the sole motives which give rise to hostilities. Doubtless, had a national hatred, or an opposition of interests been necessary, one might have expected an uninterrupted continuance of that harmony, which is so perfectly suitable to the habits and interests of the two nations. In all cases, and under all circumstances, his maj. will be very far from laying any thing to the charge of his Catholic maj.'s wishes, or of the intentions of his govt. He will attribute it to a fatal combination of circumstances, and to the consequence of the unfortunate engagements which have reunited a friendly power to his natural enemy. I am, &amp; c. J. H.

Your dispatches, to No. 54. inclusive, have been received and laid before the King. His maj. feels additional reasons (conformably to the system of policy which he has already laid down) for endeavouring to preserve the relations of peace with Spain as long as is compatible with his honour, and a due attention to the essential interests of his dominions. The information, however, contained in your last dispatches is not sufficient to enable his maj. to decide how far it may be possible for him to extend his forbearance. The pecuniary succours to be afforded by Spain to France unquestionably furnish in themselves a justifiable cause of war; but considering the light in which they were explained on a former occasion, his maj. is unwilling to proceed to extremities under the present circumstances, on this measure alone, provided, he can obtain a satisfactory explanation on other points, and that he can be convinced of the sincere intention of the Spanish govt. to cause their neutrality to be respected in every other particular. His maj.'s final decision, however, on this point, must depend on circumstances, of which he has, not at present sufficient information to enable him to form his judgment. 1st, What, is the purport of the other stipulations contained in the treaty between the King of Spain and the French govt.? Whether any obligations are imposed by them on his Catholic maj. inconsistent with the rights or just pretensions of this country? 2d, What are the extent and amount of the naval preparations in the ports of Spain, and what are the explanations given of those preparations by the Spanish govt.? His maj. cer-
<col>80</col>
tainly has a clear right to demand the fullest explanation on both these points, before he can be expected to answer the question of M. Cevallos, Whether the pecuniary succours afforded by Spain to France will be made by his maj. the ground of war? You will therefore state to the Spanish govt. that his maj. conceives he has a right, before they can claim any forbearance at his hands, to a full and entire communication in confidence of all the engagements subsisting between the Spanish govt. and that of France (particularly of the whole of the treaty recently concluded), and of the principles upon which the Spanish govt. intends to regulate its conduct, as well with respect to armaments, as in all other particulars; that when the whole case is laid before his maj. he will be enabled to determine what conduct it may be proper for him to adopt; but that it cannot possibly be expected that his maj. should acquiesce in one stipulation of a treaty, and that of a nature highly injurious to his interests, and submit at the same time to remain in complete ignorance of all the other stipulations it contains; that the circumstance of armaments in the ports of Spain cannot but afford to his maj. very serious ground of jealousy, and the greatest suspicion that the Spanish govt. has in its contemplation some ulterior projects of hostility against his dominions; that an unreserved confidence on the part of the govt. of Spain will not fail to be met by a reciprocal conduct on the part of his maj.; and that whatever maybe the issue of the present discussions, neither party will be in danger, by these means, of being hurried into hostilities from a misconception of the views, intentions, and engagements of the other.&#x2014;I cannot too strongly recommend to you to avoid bringing these discussions to a sudden and unfavourable issue, except in the two cases stated in your former instructions, viz. the entrance of a French army into Spain, or authentic information of a naval armament being in such forward preparation, for the purpose of supporting the views of France, or for other purposes hostile to this country, as may speedily require the exertions of his maj.'s forces.</p>

This system is rendered still more necessary, by the impossibility of obtaining from Spain any substantial pledge for her future conduct; so long, at least, as she continues to follow the same system of subordination to France. The consequence, therefore, of any explanation or understanding between the two courts, would be only to bind his maj.'s govt. gratuitously, while Spain would remain in her present state as long as the French govt. might find it convenient, and would afterwards, without shame or hesitation, plead necessity as a sufficient excuse for any violation of faith which her ally might think proper to dictate.&#x2014;it will be proper to mention to your Idp. a circumstance, which shews the importance of attending to the first consideration which I mentioned, namely, that of the entire subordination of this country to France under its present system. When, in conformity to your Idp.'s instructions, I applied for a communication of the treaty, it was replied, that it was impossible; that when it was first made, the necessity of making such a communication to the Brit. govt. had been insisted upon, but that Gen. Bournonville had positively overruled this proposal. In the course of the same conversation, when I insisted strongly upon the two points of the cessation of naval armaments, and the sale of prizes, in answer to what I said upon the Litter point, it was said, "Well, we must tell the French that you will not put up with it, and that it cannot be." These expressions so strongly mark, both the value which the French attach to the continuance of the present state of things with respect to Spain, and the perfect dominion which they exercise over this govt. that I cannot but conceive that, even if they stood alone, they would be a
<col>82</col>
sufficient proof of the instability of any engagement with this court, and of the disadvantage which his maj.'s govt. would be exposed to by being bound to an arrangement, which the French certainly consider as, in a high degree, favourable to their own interests, and which they will find no difficulty in violating, whenever in their opinion it ceases to be so.&#x2014;Of the notes, copies of which are inclosed, No. I, was written upon a report which reached me of orders having been sent down, and of great activity prevailing in the ports, which I thought it my duty to take notice of in pretty strong terms. M. Cevallos' reply is, as your Idp. will observe, in the same style, and in his note he does not dissemble, that the preparations are made, with a view to vindicate and assert their present pretended system of neutrality. This note appeared to me, both from its substance and tone, too much like a defiance, and so impossible to be passed over, that I conceived it my duty to return a very decided and peremptory reply; in which, at the same time, I took an opportunity of stating, as clearly as I was able, the evident justice of the demand which I was charged to make on the part of his maj.'s govt, concluding with a positive intimation of the immediate bad consequences which would ensue in case of a negative or unsatisfactory answer. The answer from M. Cevallos is, as your Idp. will perceive, very different, in tone, though in fact conceding very little, and perfectly nugatory and trifling upon the two important points, of a cessation of naval preparations, and the sale of prizes, and concluding by desiring an explanation of the intentions and views of England with respect to the present situation of Spain. In my answer, which I have framed in a correspondent tone of moderation, I avoid taking any notice of this question, and insist upon the difference between the concessions of the Spanish govt. on the other points, and the demands of his maj. and argue them at some length, concluding with a repetition of the same intimations of the dangerous consequences to be apprehended from a perseverance in the present measures.</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-00762">(<i>Translation of third inclosure in No. 10.</i>)&#x2014;<i>Note from J. H. Frere, Esq. to D. P. Cevallos, dated</i> 24th Jan. 1804. Sir, After having very deeply reflected on the subject of your excl.'s note of the 13th inst. I find myself at last under the necessity of coming to a clear and explicit explanation.&#x2014;In my note of the 13th of last month, I declared to your excl. by order of my govt. that the supply of pecuniary succours, such as had been stipulated by the treaty recently concluded with France, was considered by his maj. as the kind of succours the most efficacious and best adapted to the wants of the enemy, the most prejudicial to the interests of his Brit, maj. subjects, and the most dangerous to his dominions; in short, more than equivalent to every species of aggression&#x2014;I again repeated the same declaration, supported by arguments in detail in another note, dated the 26th, to which your excl. has not thought proper to reply. Indeed, it was not of a nature to require an answer. G. Brit, there declared, that she saw in the conduct of the court of Spain a just motive for war; she makes no reproaches, she demands no satisfaction, she confines herself to a declaration of the wrongs she has suffered; and were she compelled to commence hostilities, she would need no other declaration than that which has already been made. Nevertheless, it is pointed out in this declaration itself, and your excl. cannot be ignorant, that his Brit. maj. was by no means disposed to precipitate this crisis, to which it appears that we are now approaching with hasty strides&#x2014;His Brit. maj. fully persuaded that this truly hostile conduct of the court of Spain was by no means in union with the principles and intentions of his Catholic maj. was desirous of listening to every admissible arrangement, in order to prolong for an indefinite term the suspension of hostilities, in the reasonable hope that the fluctuating state of the continent might at last be settled in such a manner as to secure the tranquillity of Spain, and to afford her the means of extricating herself from that situation which your excl. is pleased to term neutrality, in order to place herself in a state of real and respectable neutrality.&#x2014;This conduct is the most convincing proof of the value which England attaches to the friendship of Spain, and of the interest which she takes in its independence. In every other view such forbearance would be absolutely inexplicable.&#x2014;His Brit. maj. however, cannot avoid insisting upon conditions founded in justice and in reason, and which are very far from, being equivalent to the advantages which Spain derives from the inaction of the British
<image src="S1V0003P0I0057"/>
<col>85</col>
forces. Indeed, it does not appear just, that Spain should take advantage of the good dispositions of England, to carry on against her a twofold warfare: the 1st, the most prejudicial of any, by furnishing pecuniary succours to the enemy; and the 2nd, by admitting the enemy into its ports upon a more favourable footing, by permitting the sale of prizes made by their privateers, and by encouraging the fitting of them out; and, in fine, by shewing them, on all occasions, a decided preference. Another condition, not less equitable, is that of the suspension of all farther armin a-in the ports of this kingdom. In every case wherein hostilities are suspended between two powers, it is invariably agreed, that they should remain in <i>statu quo</i> relative to their military preparations. As to England, she is neither in the intention, nor under the necessity, of increasing her's; all her preparations have long since been completed: the peninsula is closely blockaded by her squadrons, whose commanders wait only orders for acting.&#x2014;I have thus, sir, without reserve, laid before you the ideas of my govt. on the actual relative situation of the two countries, as well as on the principles resulting therefrom, and on the indisputable pretensions founded upon those principles. These pretensions extend to two objects; namely, the cessation of all naval armaments, and a perfect equality in the treatment shewn to the vessels and subjects of his Brit. maj. and to those of the enemy. I must likewise inform your excl. that, in proposing the above conditions, I communicate the ultimate resolution of my govt. with the certainty that a negative or unsatisfactory answer would immediately produce the consequences which I have so long endeavoured to avert.

Frere, Esq. dated Aranjucz,</i> 27th Jan. 1804.&#x2014;Sir, I have received three notes from you, dated the 23d and 24th inst. and having given account of their contents to the king, my master, I have the honour to reply to you hi the following terms: you complain that, notwithstanding our colonial system, a French privateer has received shelter in the bay of Cumana, and been permitted to sell an English vessel captured in the gulf of Paria. Although our legislation does not permit foreign ships to enter the ports of our colonies, there are certain cases, recommended by humanity and natural right, which form many exceptions to that general rule. The French privateer sheltered in Cumana will probably have found herself in some such situation; and in order to examine into the affair, and to take
<col>86</col>
such measures as may be suitable to the result, his maj. has commanded me to transmit the strictest orders to the minister of war, &#x2014;The purchase of prizes brought into neutral ports has never been looked upon as an act of hostility, or infraction of neutrality, but as a lawful speculation of the commerce of neutral nations.&#x2014;The king, my master, has recognized the justice with which you claim that his Brit. maj. subjects should be treated throughout Spain with the same consideration as French citizens; and, since the date of the treaty of neutrality with France, has given the strictest orders to avoid every predilection, which can appear in the least degree inconsistent with our system of strict neutrality.&#x2014; As soon as his maj. had notice by his minister in London of the occurrences which have taken place in the island of Teneriffe, which form the subject of the note which you were pleased to send me on the 24th, without waiting for the complaint contained in that note, he commanded me to transmit an order to the governor of the said island, to give satisfaction as to the charges, and information upon the acts which are attributed to him. These orders are now repeated, accompanied by the deposition of two subjects of his Brit. maj. which you are pleased to transmit to me, in order that the governor's justification may correspond to each of the subjects of complaint.&#x2014;You judge, with your known prudence and discretion, that these abuses, if they exist, cannot originate in orders issued by the Spanish govt. and you do it the justice to believe that it will punish them as soon as the result of its enquiries shall put it in a situation to shew its severity towards those who may have merited it.&#x2014;You are pleased to transmit to me another note of the same date, in which you assure me that his Brit. maj, duly appreciating the principles and pacific intentions of the king, my master, has wished to lend himself to every admissible measure for the sake of prolonging the suspension of hostilities to an indefinite period; a suspension which, if indeed it is founded upon those <i>data,</i> will have no period, and will be as firm as are those principles which essentially constitute the policy of the king, my master.&#x2014;Another subject of complaint is the permission to sell prizes in our ports. I have had the honor to say in answer to another note, that the purchase of prizes is an act of authorised commerce, free from all hostility, when the permission of selling is not confined to one of the belligerent powers, but common to both.&#x2014;With regard to the complaint that the French ship? are received in our ports upon a more favour
<image src="S1V0003P0I0058"/>
<col>87</col>
able footing, and that a decided preference is given to them, I have the honour to repeat to you, that the orders of the king, my master, are confined to an equality of protection, and the most strict neutrality.&#x2014;Besides these conditions for the continuance of neutrality, you demand a suspension, on the part of Spain, of all further armament in the ports of this kingdom, founding your demand upon the identity of the principle, by which, when hostilities are suspended between two powers, they are fixed in <i>statu quo</i> with regard to their military preparations. The principles which hold good in a suspension of hostilities, cannot be applied to a case of neutrality, without infringing which, a power may arm, in order to be prepared for every event or even to preserve the neutrality which she desires.&#x2014;The intentions of the Spanish govt. are very far removed from all hostility. His Brit. maj. could not do less than recognise the. pacific views of the king, my master; his maj. has given irresistible proofs that he does not desire to change them, both in the sacrifices which have been made to procure the neutrality of this kingdom, and a free and secure circulation for the commerce of his subjects; as well as in the prompt justice, which has been executed, before it was demanded, upon those of his subjects, who have forgotten the duties which the neutrality imposes.&#x2014;These <i>data</i> being laid down, I do not find how it is possible that you should apprehend that Spain is occupying herself with further armaments, with which she may act in a sense contrary to her pacific system.&#x2014;The official correspondence, by which you have endeavoured to maintain a good understanding, whilst it claims my acknowledgments, forms the glory and constitutes the essence of your mission; but you will agree with me, that your note abounds in phrases of a contradictory signification; some assure the continuation of a goad understanding between the two powers, at others breed apprehensions that it may be disturbed; and this collision of security and mistrust is a great impediment to the advantages which the king proposed to himself from his neutrality.&#x2014;In order that they may be no longer thus embarrassed, I hope, sir, that, making a due estimate of the frankness, and precise and positive terms in which I have had the honor to declare to you the invariable system of the Spanish cabinet, you will in return declare to me in like terms, whether G.

Cevallos, dated</i> 18th Feb. 1604.&#x2014;Sir, considerations, on which it is at present unnecessary, to dwell, have induced me to defer the execution of my instructions, as to the answer which I am to give to your excl.'s note of the 27th ult. The friendly form and the flattering personal expressions of this note, render it an infinitely painful duty to me to discharge, in representing to you the extreme difference which exists between the conditions proposed on the part of his Brit. maj. and those to which your excl. has thought it right to agree. I regret it the more, from the knowledge that these propositions form the ultimatum of my govt. and that the resolutions which it has taken in this respect are not susceptible of any alteration. In fine, sir, I should absolutely despair of seeing things remain longer in their present situation, if the Confidence with which the principles of his maj. and the discernment of your excl. inspire me, did not hold out to me the prospect, that an arrangement might possibly be made, in conformity with the demands of his Brit. maj. and with that justice upon which they are founded.&#x2014;The naval armaments of Spain in the actual situation of affairs, cannot fail to excite apprehensions on the part of his Brit. maj. The question of Louisiana being now terminated, these armaments can only have England or France for their object. Whilst the discussions with the American states still existed, it might be supposed that these preparations were for an unavowed destination. Should they still continue, it would be no longer possible to attribute them to any other motive than that which your excl. announces, namely, a jealousy of the intentions of England, and a determination to maintain by force a state of things qualified by the name of neutrality, but to which the necessary conditions of neutrality are totally wanting. This pretension is not less injurious to the interests of England than offensive to its honour. There is another, consideration still more important. His maj. at the same time that he does justice to the dispositions of his Catholic maj. and to the intentions of his ministers, Cannot be blind to the influence which his enemies have obtained in this country, and the species of authority which they exercise in it. This consideration has been the motive of great forbearance on his Brit, maj.'s part, to which he would certainly not have condescended, had he imagined that the dispositions of the court of Spam were in unison wall its measures. But this same consi-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0059"/>
<col>89</col>
deration must necessarily inspire his maj.'s ministers and counsellors with a just distrust of the future conduct of Spain. Your excl.'s assurances would certainly be a sufficient guarantee of the intentions and wishes of his Catholic maj: but unfortunately these cannot answer for the will of France, nor for the exercise of an influence which may be paramount to the former decisions of that court. It would therefore be proper, nay, an indispensable duty, on the part of the Brit. govt. to watch the armaments and the movements of the squadrons already equipped in the ports of this kingdom, by employing squadrons of equal force: I say, that the minister who should neglect such precautions, would render himself responsible to his country in the highest degree. Therefore, I entreat your excl. to consider what would necessarily be the relative situation of the two countries. Spain would furnish to France those pecuniary succours which are indispensable to her carrying on an active war against England. She would moreover oblige England to support a most burdensome defensive establishment, in order to watch the squadrons which she might have equipped in her ports. I demand of you, sir, if such a state of things is politically or morally admissible, and upon what pretence can be founded the desire that it should be tolerated by any govt.? Would not this consequence necessarily result from it, that the forces which should be employed to watch the ports of Spain, would at the same time receive a commission to act? If this consequence be inevitable, the Brit. govt. holds its conduct to be more just, more frank, nay, more amicable, in representing, in the first instance as immediate, a consequence, which, although certain, might perhaps appear less striking in a more distant prospect. It is for this reason, sir, that I am ordered to declare to you, that the system of forbearance on the part of England absolutely depends "on the cessation of every naval armament within the ports of this kingdom, and that I am expressly forbidden to prolong my residence here, if unfortunately this condition should be rejected.&#x2014;There is likewise another condition equally essential and indispensable. The principle upon which G. Brit, has justly manifested the utmost jealousy, is the maintenance of the ancient maritime law, established for centuries, and universally acknowledged by all Christian states, until these latter days. The Fr. Repub. finding herself cramped by the superiority of her adversary, has endeavoured to remedy that inconvenience, by destroying
<col>90</col>
the ancient code, the principles of which, since they authorised the advantages resulting from a superiority of force, would necessarily appear inimical to her. She has, in consequence, endeavoured to establish two principles; the first of which, by covering the effects of a belligerent power, under the safeguard of a neutral bottom, would secure to the weaker power an efficacious protection. This principle was capable of a cerain colouring of humanity and public good; since it had an immediate tendency to withdraw the property of individuals from the calamities of war, and to confine the effects of this scourge within a narrower compass. But respect for ancient usages and a more enlightened justice have prevailed, and this innovating principle has been generally rejected. France had also need of a principle of offensive war, equally favourable to the weaker power. She trusted she had found it, in the right which she arrogated to herself of condemning and of selling her prizes in neutral ports; but as this principle is very far from having the same advantages as the preceding one, since it extends without bounds the ravages of war and the losses of individuals, it was rejected and disclaimed, more promptly and in a more forma manner. One of the most respectable powers has felt that she was obliged, in justice and in honour, to give satisfaction for the wrongs which had been occasioned by the inconsiderate admission of this principle. This power is now herself prosecuting claims at this court, with the just confidence of being able to obtain a compensation, similar to that she thought it incumbent on her to grant. But Spain is the power of all others the most interested in the preservation of ancient principles. What, indeed, would be her situation with regard to those powers,, whilst she possesses no means whatever of attacking, if, in the event of war, the ports of Jamaica, of Trinidad, and of Gibraltar, were open to their privateers? Moreover, this usage necessarily produces an infinity of abuses. Privateers are frequently the property of neutral subjects, and manned with a neutral crew. Examples of this atrocious proceeding have been proved in several instances of captures of American vessels, and even recently privateers have been fitted out at Teneriffe and at Tarifa, which could not have been on account of French individuals, who were the ostensible proprietors. It is evident, that Spain, owing to her distant and extensive possessions, would be of all powers the most liable to become responsible for the abuses of her neutrality, in case
<image src="S1V0003P0I0060"/>
<col>91</col>
this new principle was established. She would likewise be subjected, in the event of war, to be attacked by powers whose activity, happily for her, is restricted by ancient principles; nevertheless, she is the only one who thinks she has the right and the power to infringe them. I do not suppose that your excl. can flatter yourself, that G. Brit, having so tenaciously persisted in opposing the establishment of the first of these principles, can be disposed to admit the establishment of the second, infinitely more pernicious, more unreasonable, and which has already been rejected by every other power.&#x2014;My orders on this head are equally-positive with those on the subject of the armaments. I communicate them to your excl. with that confidence which your wisdom and penetration inspire; but I must also explicitly declare, that I am not authorised to admit any modification; and that, if I am unable to obtain from your excl. the admission of these two conditions, namely, the cessation of all armaments, and orders to stop the sale of prizes brought into the ports of this kingdom, I am to consider all negotiation as at an end, and to think only of returning to my superiors, to render an account of my mission.</p>

The accounts which I receive from the ports do not indicate any preparation on the part of this govt, and M.

Gen. of Gallicia will not have failed to communicate to your excl. the representations which have been made to him by the commander in chief of his Brit, maj.'s Fleet stationed off Ferrol, with regard to the reinforcements of soldiers and sailors who traverse Spain, in order to reach the French squadron now in that port. Admiral Cochrane, on his side, has transmitted to me his correspondence; and although I should have desired to be enabled to verify with more precision what foundation there might be for these complaints, before I laid them officially before your excl. I have thought it more conformable to the dispositions of my govt. to endeavour to prevent, by remonstrances, which may be premature, an act so decidedly hostile to England, than to risk being under that still more painful necessity which the certainty of its having been performed would impose upon me. I will also confess to your excl. that the private information I possess on the passage of French soldiers from Malaga to Ferrol, has seemed to me to confirm the other accounts which have been given to adm. Cochrane. And it is possible that, as this govt. did not oppose this indirect violation of its territory, France may have been encouraged to try a still more open and flagrant one, by obtaining a passage through Spain for troops going from France itself, in order to reinforce its squadron at Ferrol.-&#x2014;As the commander in chief, in communicating to me his correspondence with the capt. gen. of Galicia, informs me,

Sir; I flatter myself, that your excl. will not blame my impatience to receive some satisfactory answer on the subject of my note of the 20th of this month. I have since that day received authentic accounts of the passage of several small detachments of Frenchmen going to Ferrol; and I believe that this circumstance is not at this moment unknown to his Catholic maj.'s govt.; but in any case, should they think propel to make inquiries into the fact, it would afford some satisfaction to me, to receive, in the mean while, your excl.'s assurance, that measures were already taken to put a stop to this abuse, of the continuance of which the Spanish govt. must henceforward charge itself with the consequences.

Cochrane, that orders have been given by the court of Madrid, for arming without loss of time at Ferrol 4 ships of the line, 2 frigates, and other smaller vessels; that similar orders have been given at Carthagena and Cadiz; and particularly that 3 first rate ships of the line are directed to sail from the last-mentioned port; and as an additional proof of hostile intentions, that orders have been given to the packets to arm as in time of war.&#x2014;In consequence of this information, I am commanded to signify to you his maj.'s pleasure, that as soon as you receive this dispatch, you should request an audience of M. de Cevallos.&#x2014;You will express to him the surprise and concern with which the intelligence of these unexpected and unjustifiable measures has been received in this country.&#x2014;You will recal to the recollection of that minister, the grounds* upon which his maj. has hitherto forborne from considering Spain as an enemy. That nothing Could have induced him to continue this forbearance, but a sincere desire to avoid extending the calamities of war, and a willingness to confide in the assurances of the Spanish govt. that the payments made to France were only intended to gain time, until circumstances should enable them to adopt measures more consistent with their
<col>96</col>
interests and their wishes. That his maj. had repeatedly required a communication of the engagements entered into with France, but had only received in answer to such demands an indefinite assurance, that whatever might be the amount of the payments to be made by Spain to France, they had been calculated with a reference to the expence of the military and naval succours stipulated by treaty. That no means had been afforded to his maj. of judging whether the payments were in fact only an equivalent for the succours, or whether they so far exceeded that amount as to make it impossible to consider Spain otherwise than as a principal in the war.&#x2014;That his maj. therefore had been under the necessity of expressly reserving to himself the fall right of regulating his conduct towards Spain, according to the appearance of existing circumstances; but that the abstaining from all naval preparations on the part of that power had been distinctly declared to be one of the indispensable conditions annexed by his maj. to the continuance of his forbearance. &#x2014;You will state to M. de Cevallos, that, after such declarations had been made, it would be difficult to suppose that any explanation could be given of the present naval preparations, which would render such a proceeding consistent with the neutrality which is professed; but it is manifestly impossible to consider it, unaccompanied as it has been by navy previous explanation, whatever, in any other light than as a menace, directly hostile, and imposing upon his maj. the duty of taking, without delay, every measure of precaution; and particularly of giving orders to his admiral, off the pore of Ferrol, to prevent any of the Spanish ships of war from sailing from diat port, or any additional ships of war from entering it. &#x2014; The whole conduct of his maj. towards Spain has abundantly proved his earnest desire to carry that forbearance to the utmost limit which a due regard to the safety and interests of his people would admit: but he cannot depart from the declarations he has already made, nor allow Spain to enjoy all the advantages of neutrality, and, at the same time, to carry on against him a double war, by assisting his enemies with pecuniary succours, to which no limit is assigned; and by obliging him, at the same time, to divert a part of his naval force from acting against those enemies, in order to watch the armaments carried on in ports professing to be neutral.&#x2014;You are, therefore, directed to require from the Spanish govt. the immediate recal of all orders for the naval armaments at Ferrol, Cadiz, and Carthagena, as well as for sending reinforcements from.

<col>97</col>
some of those ports to others; and you will apprize M. de Cevallos, that, unless you receive a satisfactory answer without delay, you are ordered to quit Madrid. If positive and unequivocal assurances are given, not only that the present naval equipments shall be discontinued, but that the naval armaments in the ports of Spain shall be placed upon the same footing on which they were previously to the commencement of hostilities between G. Brit, and France, you will engage to transmit such assurances to his maj. and you will take upon yourself to answer for its being the intention of his maj. in case there appears sufficient reason to believe that they will be strictly fulfilled, to send a minister to Madrid, for the purpose of entering into an amicable discussion of all other points of difference.&#x2014;It must, however, be distinctly understood, that no such discussion can be entered into, unless the court of Spain is prepared to give such an explanation of its engagements with France, and of the system which it intends to adopt, as may enable his maj. to ascertain the nature of the relations which are to subsist between himself and his Catholic maj.&#x2014;If the answer given by M. de Cevallos should be negative or equivocal, you will demand your passports, and leave Madrid.

The total cessation of all preparations in the ports having been the principal condition required by England, and agreed to by Spain, as the price of the continuance of that system of forbearance which England has hitherto observed, the violation of this condition, against which I now protest, can be considered in no other light than as a hostile aggression on the part of Spain, and a defiance given to England.&#x2014;It is in vain that I seek to interpret this precipitate measure in a manner more conformable to the wishes of ray govt. and less disastrous to the two nations. It
<col>98</col>
becomes still more menacing, in consequence of a squadron of the enemy being in the port where it is carrying on. Having discharged my duty towards my own govt. in protesting against this measure, it still remains for me to fulfil the one I owe to that of his Catholic maj. namely, to apprize them, that in no case can England be indifferent to the armament which is preparing, nor consent to its being carried on; and I entreat that your excl. previous to giving me an answer, will duly consider the serious consequences which will result, if it be determined to complete the misery which presses so heavily on this country, by plunging it unnecessarily into a ruinous war.

Hamond, arrived at Portsmouth on Wednesday morning with the Fama, a Spanish frigate, laden with dollars, from the Rio de la Plata, and brought information of the action which took place on the 5th inst. between 4 of his maj.'s frigates, and the same number of Spanish frigates, in which 3 of the latter were captured, and I unfortunately blew up.&#x2014;Although, from the situation of the ships when this action happened, it is probable that the event is known at the court of Madrid, I have thought it necessary to give you this information without loss of time, in order that you may be able to explain to the Spanish govt. the principles upon which the orders given to his maj.'s naval commanders are rested, and the effect which this event is here considered to have upon the relative si-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0064"/>
<col>99</col>
tuation of the two countries.&#x2014;As the subject was fully discussed in a conference which took place yesterday, between the Spanish minister and myself, I cannot point out to you more distinctly the language which his maj. thinks proper to be held upon this occasion, than by stating to you the substance of this conversation.&#x2014;In answer to the first question of the Spanish minister, in what light this event was to be considered; I informed him, that it was an act done in consequence of express orders from his maj. to detain all ships laden with treasure for Spain. That such orders had been issued as soon as intelligence was received of the equipment of naval armaments in the ports of Spain, and particularly at Ferrol, without any previous explanation. That the court of Madrid could have no reason to be surprised that such a step was taken, as it had been repeatedly stated to die Spanish govt. and particularly in a note delivered by Mr. Frere on the 18th of Feb. last, that as long as they continued in a situation of merely nominal neutrality, any naval armament in their ports must be considered as putting an immediate end to the forbearance of England, and as necessarily producing consequences that were distinctly pointed out. I added, that upon the first intelligence of the armament, adm. Cochrane had been directed to communicate to the govt. of Ferrol the orders he had received to oppose the sailing of any Spanish ships of war to or from the port of Ferrol; and Mr. B. Frere had also been directed to inform the court of Madrid of the orders given by his maj. that all necessary measures of precaution should be taken, and particularly those notified by adm. Cochrane. The Spanish minister then observed, that his court was not apprised of the orders given to detain the ships laden with treasure, which being ships of war, their resistance to any attempt to detain them must have been foreseen. I observed in reply, that this was the first and most obvious of those measures of precaution which had been announced. That it had been thought right to announce precisely the intention of engaging the ships of war which might attempt to sail to or from Ferrol, because it would depend upon the Spanish govt. after receiving such an intimation, to give such orders as to their sailing as it might think proper, and to prevent a hostile meeting between the two squadrons; but that to have announced more particularly the intention of detaining the treasure ships, must either have been perfectly useless, if the Spanish govt. had no means of giving them notice of such intention or must have afforded the opportu-
<col>100</col>
nity of rendering it completely abortive. That Spain having violated one of the conditions upon which the forbearance of his maj. depended, it became immediately necessary for him to prevent the continuance of those succours which were furnished by Spain to France. That these succours were of two kinds; naval armaments and treasure. That his maj. had hitherto submitted' with unexampled moderation, to connive at the payment of a subsidy by Spain to France, upon the grounds which have been often stated; but that, from the moment Spain had manifested the intention, instead of confining herself to pecuniary assistance, to add her naval forces to these of France, and had manifested it in the least equivocal manner, by equipping a considerable squadron in the port of Ferrol, where it would be ready to join a squadron of French ships, and to outnumber the British force employed in blockading them; from that moment his maj. could no longer delay carrying into execution every measure of necessary precaution; and he had as just a right to detain treasure destined to increase the means of his enemies, as to attack the ships of Spain sailing in conjunction with those of France. I expressed in strong terms his maj.'s concern at the loss of so many valuable lives in the conflict, and particularly at the unfortunate accident, which destroyed one of the Spanish frigates (the Mercedes), with nearly the whole of her crew. I did not controvert his observation, that it was impossible for those frigates not to resist, when they were met by so equal a force; and I thought it right to avow without hesitation, that, although it was hoped the treasure might have been brought in single ships, of a force so inferior to his maj.'s squadron as to justify the expectation that they might be detained without violence, yet that his maj.'s govt. were aware that this expectation might be disappointed, and as the act itself was thought necessary, had determined to incur the hazard of what might follow from resistance.&#x2014;To the question put by the Spanish minister, in what state the Spanish frigates and their crews were to be considered; I replied, in the same state as ships and crews detained under similar circumstances upon former occasions. That the officers and men would be treated with every possible attention, and the treasure would be transported to a place of security, to await such orders as the issue of the present discussions with the court of Madrid may appear to his maj. to require.&#x2014;After these points had been discussed, the Spanish minister desired to know, whether this event was to be considered as putting an
<image src="S1V0003P0I0065"/>
<col>101</col>
end to all further explanation, and placing the two countries in a state of war.&#x2014;To this I replied, that it was certainly by no means so considered on our part. That it was still the earnest wish of his maj. that such explanations, assurances, and securities, might be given by the court of Madrid respecting their naval armaments, present and future, and respecting all other subjects of discussion between the two govts. as might not only maintain an amicable intercourse between them, but establish it in future upon a more distinct and permanent footing. An explanation of the naval armaments alone, would not then (replied M. d'Anduaga) now Satisfy the English govt.?&#x2014;To this I answered, that such an explanation alone would not now satisfy us, nor would it have been satisfactory at any former period. The court of Madrid had repeatedly been informed, that his maj. could not be satisfied without being made completely acquainted with the relation in which Spain stands with respect to France, in order to be enabled to judge upon a full view of all the circumstances, in what relation he could consent to consider Spain as standing with respect to G. Brit&#x2014;In reply to several observations which fell from the Chev. d'Anduaga, that assurances had been given, as to the amount of the subsidy which was stated to be only an equivalent for military succours; as to the contents of the treaty with France, which was alledged to contain nothing injurious to the interests of G. Brit.; as to the innocent destination of any armaments which might be made; as to the decided intention of his Catholic maj. to preserve the strictest neutrality; and as to the injustice of any suspicions which could attach to Spanish honor and veracity, I assured him, in return, that both the govt. and the nation had the highest value and respect for Spanish honor and veracity; but that we had too much ground from experience to be slow in trusting the ability of Spain to act up to the honorable and independent principles by which her conduct would naturally be guided. That I sincerely wished the armaments in question might prove to have been really, as he had endeavoured to represent them, only the consequence of an order given under the pressure of necessity, for the purpose of transporting troops to subdue the revolters in Biscay; but that if this were really the intention of the order, it was inconceivable, that no notice should have been given to the British minister at Madrid, or to the admiral off the port of Ferrol, who might have conveyed the explanation of the armament at the same moment with the news of its existence. That
<col>102</col>
it was singular, if ships of the line were to be used for this purpose, that they should not have been equipped merely as transports. That although the orders were received at Ferrol on the 7th of last month, and must consequently have been given at Madrid some days earlier, yet up to this moment he was possessed of no direct information from his court, was authorised to give me no explanation, and was reduced to state upon this subject his own conjecture, founded upon imperfect intelligence, and upon his own earnest wishes to explain the transaction in a manner calculated to prevent a rupture between the two countries. Having dwelt upon the various grounds, which made this explanation improbable and unsatisfactory, I concluded the conversation by expressing my fears, that the orders would be found to have proceeded from that influence, which had unfortunately so long diverted the Spanish councils from an attention to their real interest and dignity; that the measure, if dictated by that influence, would probably be persisted in; and that a breach would then become inevitable; but that the moderation and forbearance of his maj.'s conduct hitherto, (to which the Spanish minister bore the fullest testimony), would be a sufficient security, that no reasonable means of accommodation would be rejected; and that I should be equally desirous with himself to be the instrument of establishing between our respective countries a greater degree of harmony and cordiality than could exist between a nominal neutrality on the one side, and to jealous forbearance on the other.&#x2014;I am in daily expectation of hearing from you what passed at Madrid upon the receipt of the communication made by adm. Cochrane to the Spanish govt. off Ferrol; until that information is received, I have nothing to add to my former instructions.&#x2014;P. S. Since this was written, an account was received of the arrival of his maj.'s ships, the Amphion and Indefatigable, with the Spanish frigates, the Medea and the Clara. I am, &amp;c.</p>

Cevallos, which he gave me on the 21st, I told him that I believed he would find by his letters from England that the sensation which the late unexpected armament at Ferrol had caused
<image src="S1V0003P0I0066"/>
<col>103</col>
there, had been by no means over-rated in the note which I had addressed to him upon the subject some weeks ago; that I was now charged to declare to him formally his maj.'s surprise and concern at such a measure having been adopted without any previous communication to him, and unaccompanied by any explanations of its object; and to require the immediate recal of all orders which might have been given at Ferrol or elsewhere, for increasing their naval force, or for altering its position; and that it should be reduced to the state in which it was at the beginning of the war. M. Cevallos said, that he found that there had been a great deal of misrepresentation and exaggeration upon the subject of this armament, which he affected to treat very lightly; he said, that the expedition consisted of a few ships, which were already armed at the time, whose destination I must be well acquainted with; that the project was now given up, and he wished to infer that there was therefore no ground of complaint for what had passed. I replied, that I knew no more of the destination of this expedition, than what I had learnt from public report, which was, that it was meant to convey troops to quell at; insurrection in Biscay; but that it had appeared to me so incredible that ships of war should be aimed to carry forces to a province which had no ports to receive them, which was already in the possession of their troops, and which was so situated, that the march by land might be performed in a much shorter time than was necessary for preparing for and making the voyage; that I had not ventured to write this report home to my govt. M. Cevallos, however, assured me that this was the design, and extravagant as it was, the march by land into Biscay of the troops before destined for the embarkation seems to confirm his assurance. I observed, that whatever might have been the object of this armament, it was equally a breach of the convention which Spain had entered into with England; and as M. Cevallos maintained that the engagement had been only contracted for not arming against G. Brit. I referred him to my brother's note of the 18th Feb. in which the cessation of all armaments is demanded in the clearest terms. I told him at the same time, that if he was now inclined to dispute this point. I must revert to the instructions upon which the demand was framed, and which were to the full as positive as those which I had now received. He protested against the extravagance of such a pretension, which he said would reduce them to the lowest state of humiliation if Spain could not arm to repel the insults of
<col>104</col>
a foreign enemy, or to quell her own rebellious subjects. I repeated the assurances of his maj.'s disposition to make every possible concession in favour of Spain; but that this was an engagement which the security of his kingdom called for, and that Spain might rely upon its being pushed no further than that object required. Finding that it was needless to attempt drawing any satisfactory assurance from M. Cevallos in conversation, I told him that my instructions related likewise to some other important points; that if he pleased I would read them over to him, after which, if he thought it necessary, I would deliver to him in writing a summary of their contents.&#x2014;In treating of the subject of the money furnished to France, he affected much surprize at its being considered merely as a temporary measure, and asked from whence my court could have got that idea, of which he himself disciaimed any share. I told him that I knew my brother had repeatedly received similar assurances at the very time when the treaty was negotiating, from a person high in authority, whose assurances were then esteemed authentic, and that as such he had transmitted them to his govt. M. Cevallos repeated that they had no such views; that the treaty was concluded for the whole of the present war; that it contained no art. whatever hostile to G. Brit, and as to the amount of the subsidies, he could only repeat what he bad already said, and what M. d,'Anduaga had stated to your 1dp. that they are calculated with a reference to the expence of furnishing the succours stipulated by treaty. This assurance, he said, he trusted I should think sufficient, and that England would so far do justice to the good faith of the Spanish cabinet as to pronounce herself satisfied with such a declaration. I observed to him, that my govt. was already in possession of thus much information upon the subject, when my present instructions were forwarded to me, and therefore that I must expect a more explicit answer, or comply with the orders to demand my passports; that in the terms in which he stated it, the amount of the succour stipulated was without any limit, since the treaty provides that in case of necessity the auxiliary power is liable to be called upon to assist her ally with all her forces; in which situation there would be no bounds to the sums which Spain might furnish to the enemy under the denomination of an equivalent for these succours. I did not, however, succeed in obtaining any further explanation upon the subject; and there was in M. Cevallos' manner a more decided determination not to give way upon this point, and more dis-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0067"/>
<col>105</col>
position to ill humour at being pressed upon it, than upon that of the total cessation of all armaments in the ports. He took no other notice of the orders given to Adm. Cochrane to shut the port of Ferrol to their ships of war, than by asking me to read that paragraph a second time; and when I had finished the dispatch, he said that Spain would continue to act with the same good faith which she had always hitherto done; that England ought to be perfectly at ease upon the subject of the armament, which had never been of any consequence, and was now laid aside; that upon the question of the subsidies, she had all the satisfaction that she could reasonably require; and that it was time that she herself should give some assurance of her own dispositions, without which a neutrality, restless and disturbed as that which Spain now possesses, would prove as prejudicial to the country as war itself. I answered, that the dispositions of my govt. towards Spain were not less friendly than they had always been, and that it was to the conduct of Spain herself that he must attribute the unsettled state of the connexion between the two countries; nor could it be otherwise, as long as she maintained this reserve upon a point which affects so essentially the interests of G. Brit, as that of her pecuniary engagements with France; and I left him, by saying, that I hoped that upon consideration he would lee it in the same light, and that I should receive a more satisfactory answer to the note which I should transmit to him, than I had been able to obtain from the conference. Your 1dp. will observe an interval of some days between this conference and the date of my note, during; which I have been confined by a return of indisposition which disabled me from writing, however, stated so fully before hand the nature of my instructions to M Cevallos, I am in hopes that no time will have been lost by this circumstance, and that I shall receive his answer as soon as if my note had been presented immediately after our conference.

<p id="S1V0003P0-00784">(<i>Translation of inclosure referred to in No. 18.)&#x2014;Note from B. Frere Esq. to D. P. Cevallos, dated Escurial, 26tn Oct.</i> 1804.&#x2014;Sir; In consequence of the desire your excl. has expressed to me, I have the honour to transmit to you in writing; the substance of the representations which I have been directed by my govt. to make to you.&#x2014;It is with equal surprise and concern that his Brit. maj. received the account of the naval preparations which have been carrying on in the ports of Spain, having on his part omitted nothing, from
<col>106</col>
the very commencement of hostilities with France, which could contribute to remove from Spain those calamities of a war, in which, owing to her treaties, she was in fact placed in the number of this enemies. Nothing, indeed, could have induced his maj. to persevere in this system of moderation, except the same benevolent motive, supported by a disposition to give credit to the assurances of the Spanish govt. that the sums furnished to France were only paid under the idea of gaining time, until circumstances would enable her to follow a system more congenial to her wishes and her interests.&#x2014;His maj. has repeatedly requested a communication of the engagements concluded with France; but the only answer has uniformly been a vague assurance, that, whatever might be the amount of the sums to be paid by Spain, they were calculated according to the estimate of what the succours, naval and military, stipulated by treaty, would amount to. But his maj. has never been furnished with any means of judging, whether these payments are in fact only a fair equivalent for those succours, or whether they so far exceed it, as to render it necessary to consider Spain a principal in the war.&#x2014;In this state of uncertainty, his maj. has been compelled expressly to reserve to himself the full right to regulate his conduct towards Spain according to the appearance of circumstances at the moment. But be has ever declared, unequivocally, that the discontinuance of ail naval preparations on the part of that power was an indispensable condition of the continuance of his moderation. Such a declaration having been made, it would be difficult to account for a naval armament on the part of Spain, in such a manner as to reconcile it with her pretended system of neutrality; and it becomes impossible to consider the present armament, which was unaccompanied by any explanation, in any other light than as a measure decidedly hostile, and which calls upon his maj. to take, without delay, every step which prudence may dictate; and more especially to give orders to his admiral, off Ferrol, to prevent any ship of war from, entering or leaving that port.&#x2014;His maj.'s uniform conduct towards Spain has abundantly proved his ardent desire to carry his moderation to the utmost extent, which a due regard for the interests and security of his people will permit. But his maj. cannot depart from the declaration which he has made, nor permit that Spain shall enjoy all the advantages of neutrality, whilst she wages a two-fold war against him, first by furnishing to his enemies unlimited pecuniary succours; and, secondly, by compelling

<col>107</col>
him to divert a part of his naval force to act against the enemy, in order to watch the armaments which are preparing in ports pre-1 tending to be neutral.&#x2014;I have in consequence received orders from his maj. to require of the Spanish govt. the immediate recal of all the orders which have been given at Ferrol, at Cadiz, or at Carthagena, as well for the equipment of ships, as for sending reinforcements from one to the other of those ports, and not only that such preparations be stopped, but that the naval armaments in all the ports of Spain shall be put precisely on the same footing as before the commencement of hostilities between England and Fiance.&#x2014;I flatter myself, that I shall not be under the necessity of announcing to your excl. more formally than I have hitherto done, what must be the inevitable consequences of a refusal of this demand. If it is fully complied with, I can answer for the intentions of his maj. to send to Madrid a minister authorised to discuss, in an amicable manner, every other subject of dispute; but still this discussion cannot take place unless Spain be prepared to give a distinct explanation of her engagements with France, and of the system which she proposes to adopt, according to which his maj. may be enabled to judge of the nature of the relations which should subsist between him and his Catholick maj.&#x2014;Your excl. may conceive the impatience with which I shall expect your answer; and some days having already elapsed since I had the honour to converse with you on the subject of this note, I hope that your decision his been already taken, and that I may flatter myself in some degree to have contributed towards the extinction of the daily alarms which trouble the good understanding between the two countries, and which are the necessary consequence of the obstinacy of Spain in refusing to give that satisfaction so justly due to the conduct of his Brit. maj.

Harrowby, dated Madrid,</i> 8<i>th Nov.</i> 1804.&#x2014;My Lord; I have the honour to inclose a copy and translation of M. Cevailos' answer to my note of the 26th, which was delivered to me on the morning of the 30th. Your Idp. will find, that neither this note, nor the paper which it inclosed, and which is a copy of M. Cevallos' instructions to M. d'Anduaga, contain any satisfaction whatever upon the two principal points, viz. a stipulation to abstain from all naval preparation; and a disposition to enter upon some fuller explanation of their pecuniary engagements with France. On the contrary, M. Cevallos observes to M. d'Anduaga,
<col>108</col>
that the explanations which have been given upon the latter point are sufficient, if the complaints of England are made with good faith; and throughout both papers there is a tone of irritation, which shews a disposition far from conciliatory. Under these circumstances I have thought that my instructions left me no choice, but to repeat distinctly my former proposals, and at the same time to demand my passports, if they were not acceded to. This I accordingly did, without the least delay in the note, of which the inclosed is a copy; and having observed that M. Cevallos affected to attach the highest importance to a slight, and, I am persuaded, accidental variation between the conditions which I was instructed to demand, and the convention before agreed to, I trust that I shall not be thought to have taken too much upon myself in venturing to make, the alteration necessary for reconciling them. Having delivered this note, I returned to Madrid to finish my preparations for dispatching the messenger, and expecting in the interval to receive M. Cevallos' reply. 'After having waited in vain till the 2d, I determined to write again to him, to press him for an answer, and accordingly sent the note. No. 5, by courier, who returned the next day, (the 3d,) bringing me M. Cevallos' note, of which I inclose a copy and translation, and in which, after a very formal introduction, and much parade of precision in the terms of his answer, he leaves the two principal questions exactly in the same state as before. I, therefore, on the same day, returned a short note, repeating my demand for passports, of which no notice having been taken, on the evening of the 5th, I determined once more to send the messenger down to the Escurial with a still more pressing renewal of my application; and after having been delayed upwards of two days, he returned this morning, bringing me my passports, which were accompanied by the inclosed note (No. 10.) In consequence of this, I propose to leave Madrid on the day after to-morrow, and Mr. Hunter will follow me as soon as he conveniently can. I am unwilling to delay the messenger a moment longer than is necessary for making your Idp. acquainted with the final determination of the Spanish govt. but I cannot help expressing my confidence that his maj.'s govt. will not see, in the course of this negotiation, any foundation for the charge of precipitation, which is brought against me by M. Cevallos. If I have any apprehension, it is lest my hopes that a more deliberate re flexion upon the fatal consequences of a rupture, and a due sense of the moderation of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0069"/>

the proposals made by his maj. with a view of avoiding such an extremity, would induce this govt. to admit my demands, should have led the to be less decided than the urgent terms of my instructions will strictly justify. I have the honour to be, &amp;c. B. FRERE.</p>

Frere, Esq. dated San Lorenzo,</i> 29<i>th Oct.</i> 1804.&#x2014;Sir;As soon as you knew that preparations were making at Ferrol for the transport of troops, ignorant, without doubt, of their destination, you sent a note to me, expressing the apprehensions which this occurrence inspired, and demanding from me an explanation of the intentions of Spain. I gave you such as the circumstances permitted, and fully sufficient to tranquillize your apprehensions, assuring you that his maj. had no ideas that could offend the harmony and constant friendship offered to his Brit, maj. Nothing was more natural than that the British cabinet should have waited the result of the representations made by its minister to the king, my master, disregardins; in the mean time all advices which were not authentic, and paying this deference to the tried good faith of the Spanish cabinet. Unhappily it has not been so; for, without other than mercantile advices, which are generally fabricated through interest, the English govt. has formed its complaints, laying down, ascertain, the fact of an armament, and styling it hostile, whereas its object was not so, neither, as it was, did it take effect.&#x2014;Notwithstanding that I had tranquillized the apprehensions which you shewed that this armament caused in you, his maj. having learnt from the conference which I had with you, that the court of London being ill informed, raised complaints which are as ill founded as they are unconformable to the true designs of Spain, by his royal order I have sent to Don Joseph D'Anguada, his. minister at that court, the proper instructions, with a view to dissipate the apprehensions of G. Brit, and declaring the true limits of the engagements of Spain in favour of France, and likewise in favour of England, as you will see by the copy which I have the honour to inclose.&#x2014;By its contents you will be undeceived, in finding that Spain has not given the subsidies to France with a view to gain time, and of waiting for an opportunity of displaying a system more analogous to her wishes, as you have permitted yourself to assert; it being difficult to conceive how you can associate the idea of momentary subsidies, and such as are furnished purely in expectation, with the knowledge and assurance of there
<col>110</col>
having been concluded a treaty of subsidies between Spain and France, equivalent to the naval and military succours determined by the alliance of the two nations, for the case of the present war.&#x2014;England agreed to the neutrality of Spain, upon condition that she should cease her armaments, which should remain in the state in which they were at the time of the convention; and notwithstanding its specified terms and religious observance of it by the Spanish govt. you claim that the armaments should he reduced in the ports of this kingdom to the state in which they were before the beginning of hostilities between England and France. The king cannot but sec in this demand a notorious infraction of the convention of neutrality proposed by England herself, and in this view he orders me to direct his minister in London to protest against a pretension, which is the more unseasonable, inasmuch as the apprehensions are greater of a desire on the part of Enland to alter the stipulated relations between herself and Spain.&#x2014;It is a measure not less infractory which you tell me your govt. have taken, in order that the commander of the fleet before Ferrol should prevent the sailing of the Spanish ships of war which are in that port, and the entrance of others of the same description. This measure, besides being nugatory (supposing the good faith of Spain,) is offensive to her honour and dignity, and truly hostile. In which view, I communicate to the king's minister an order to protest against it, and to exact from the English cabinet clear and precise explanations concerning her ideas with regard to Spain, whose neutrality is absolutely unproductive, if she is to continue in the uncertain, agitated, and equivocal state in which she has hitherto been. PEDRO CEVALLOS:</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00787">(<i>Second inclosure referred to in No. 19.)</i>&#x2014;<i>Translation of a Note from D. P. Cevallos to Don Joseph d' Anduaga, dated San Lorenzo,</i> 26<i>th Oct.</i> 1804.&#x2014;Sir; The assurances which England has received from Spain upon, her exactness in fulfilling the stipulated neutrality, and the good faith which is as it were characteristic of the Spanish cabinet, ought to have inspired the British cabinet with more circumspection, so as not to give credit to the authentic news of armaments in Cadiz and Ferrol. Spain obliged herself to cease her arming, and she has fulfilled it, since the 2 or 3 vessels which she thought to destine to the coast of Biscay were armed before the epoch of the agreed cessation of armaments.&#x2014;The idea of this agreement was to assure G. Brit, that Spain, with the knowledge and assurance of there I under the colour of neutrality, should not
<image src="S1V0003P0I0070"/>
<col>111</col>
arm her ships to unite them to those Of France when it might suit that power. To wish by this agreement that Spain should not arm even when she sees herself offended by any power, or when the tranquillity of the state requires it, is to strain the letter and spirit of the treaty, and to disregard the invariable principles which declare and explain treaties between sovereigns. In such a case the lot of a neutral power, considered until now as the most advantageous, would be the most fatal. Her enemies might commit hostilities against her with impunity; her subjects might refuse fidelity to the sovereign, assured that force could not reduce them to their duty. Under these principles, and granting for a moment the reality of the supposed new armaments, it would have been becoming that the English cabinet, less apt to give credit to news (which is easily fabricated by those who are discontented with the peace, or those who make it contribute to merchantile profit) should have asked of Spain what were her designs, before she made public demonstrations of suspicion and distrust, always injurious to the mutual commerce of the two nations. On the other hand, she ought to believe that her minister would ask, as in effect he did ask, in proper time, explanations of this much talked of (decantado) armaments, which were given conformably to what I have said; and by these the English govt. will have confirmed itself in the confidence which it owes to the promises of his maj. In this conception I replied to the English Charge d'Affaires, who read to me the dispatch of his govt. He renews the solicitation that I should declare to him the sum which, under the title of subsidies, is contributed to France, as an equivalent for the succours stipulated by the treaty of alliance; and I have repeated to him what on this point I have said to your excl. and it is what is sufficient if the complaints are made in good faith, and if it is wished to do justice to that which is as it were the characteristic of the Spanish govt. That govt. has also raised a doubt, whether our subsidy in favour of France is indefinite, or limited to the time of the present war; and I have answered, that it does not extend to other wars than the present. In fine, I told him that England might rely on the morality and good faith of Spain in the fulfilling of her obligations, but without giving to them an extension that humiliates and degrades her from the rank that belongs to her; that G. Brit, was the most interested in not altering the state of neutrality with this kingdom, from which by commerce she
<col>112</col>
draws immense sums with which she maintains her fleets; that the prejudices are incalculable which she brings upon our commerce, by her exaggerated complaints and unfounded suspicions of the ideas and views attributed to the Spanish govt. since, being known and published by those who derive benefit from them, they prevent the merchant from giving to his negotiations all the activity of which they are susceptible; that Spain having complied with the two conditions, namely, cessation of armaments, and prohibition of the sale of prizes in her ports, under which G. Brit, promised to respect the neutrality, it becomes absolutely necessary that this power should adopt towards Spain a style of greater frankness; and that in like manner, as we have protested that we will maintain our pacific relations with England, so also she should confirm to us clearly and definitively that her views are equally pacific, and the more so, when she has seen that we have not infringed any of the conditions of the neutrality agreed on. All which, by royal order, I transfer to the notice of your excl. for your information, and the correspondent use in your conferences and conversations with that ministry. PEDRO CEVALLOS.</p>

His Brit. Maj. has in fact announced to the Spanish govt. the conditions without which it would be absolutely impossible for him any longer to pursue that system of forbearance which he has hitherto followed; but he has never offered to Spain the hope of a neutrality, which treaties, ever with his enemies, rendered her incapable of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0071"/>
<col>113</col>
enjoying. Spain has been placed on her proper footing, that is to say, on that of a power with whom there was a suspension of hostilities; and the agreement made under this idea had for its object not only, as your excl. says, to prevent the equipment of her ships of war, and their junction with the French forces, but also to place herself in a better position both offensive and defensive with respect to England, than that in which she found herself at the commencement of hostilities; and how could she expect to see herself more closely connected with England, whilst her engagements with its enemies, and the sums with which she furnished them, remained a secret to England. True it is, that his Brit. maj. has received vague assurances as to the amount of these sums; but these assurances are insufficient to enable him to decide upon the nature of the permanent relations which should subsist between him and his Catholic maj. especially as, should these assurances be exact, no reason remains to refuse the communication of the treaty, since your excl. has assured me, that it does not contain any stipulation hostile to G. Brit.&#x2014;I have had the honour to inform your excl. that nothing could have engaged his maj. to persevere in his system of moderation, but his well-known benevolence, supported by a disposition to give credit to the assurances of the Spanish govt. that the payments furnished to France were only made in the intention of gaining time, and till circumstances would enable her to follow a system more congenial to her interests and her wishes. Your excl. does not appear to comprehend, whence I have derived this assertion; and although I should have supposed, that I had already pointed out its source so clearly as to exculpate my self from the imputation of having fabricated it myself, I must inform you, that his excl. the Prince of Peace gave similar assurances to the minister of his Brit. maj. whenever mention was made of the payment of the subsidies to France. It appears to be since ascertained, that the assurances of his excl. were not those of his govt. by which therefore it cannot be called upon to abide: but this explanation will doubtless make an essential alteration in the ideas of my govt. respecting the future projects of Spain, which must henceforward be considered as irrevocably connected with France, during the whole war by a treaty of subsidy, the stipulations of which she will not avow.&#x2014;In this state, of inquietude, which is the natural consequence of the silence observed by Spain list its engagements with the enemy, his Brit. maj. having received from his admiral
<col>114</col>
off Ferrol authentic accounts of an armament fitting out in that port, was in no wise called upon to wait for the explanations that Spain might offer thereon, and which have never been offered; it is sufficient, in order to justify the measures which he has taken, nay still more decisive ones, to know that an armament was fitting out, and that the engagements were violated.&#x2014;I have thus endeavoured to give an exact idea of the nature of the relations which have subsisted between the two countries from the commencement of hostilities with France, since it is from this consideration alone, that a just opinion can be formed of the present conduct of the two governments; and if your excl. is not prepared to give me an assurance, that no armament whatever shall be carried on in the ports of Spain; that the ships of war shall be put precisely in the state in which they were at the conclusion, of the convention with England; that no alteration shall take place in the distribution of force, nor indeed any naval preparation; if your excl. is not ready, at the same time, to afford my govt. the satisfaction which have had the honor to demand as to the engagements with France, I must consider, my employment here as at an end, and there only remains for me the painful duty of requesting your excl. to send the necessary passports for myself and servants, in order to return as soon as possible to England.&#x2014;our excl. complains of my having in my note demanded the reduction of the marine to the state in which it was previous to the war, whilst the period pointed out in the convention for fixing the establishment to which it was to be reduced, was that of the convention itself. It is true, that this first period was named in my instructions; but bearing in mind that another has been already agreed upon, and too well convinced of the good faith of ray govt. to believe that the substitution could have been made otherwise than by mistake, I have not hesitated to restore the period of the convention, too happy, if this trifling change can remove any obstacle to the satisfaction of my demands.

To the 2d; That there is not a greater number of ships armed than there was at the epoch of the said convention. To the 3d; That no change, infractory of the neutrality, shall be made in the distribution of the ships already armed; nor is it likely that there should be any need to change the said distribution under the supposition of neutrality. To the 4th; That the treaty of subsidies with France contains nothing offensive to, our neutrality with G. Brit, and that the subsidies are equivalent to what would be the expence of the naval and military succours, stipulated in the treaty of alliance with the French Republic.&#x2014;As my answers are not less distinct than satisfactory, for they hive been formed in no other style
<col>116</col>
than that of good faith, I think I have a fresh right to be satisfied by you in regard to the measure taken by the Brit, cabinet, in order that the commander of its forces before Ferrol should prevent the entrance of the Spanish ships in the said port; a complaint which I have not had the honour to see satisfied by you, as becomes a measure which carries with it mistrust of the Spanish govt., and offends its honour and dignity, by shackling the exercise of its domestic authority. I do not believe that you will have any difficulty in recognizing the violence of which this measure of your govt. partakes, when I observe, by your note of the 30th, (which did not reach me till after a delay of two days,) that your good faith and conciliatory spirit have prompted you to do away the equivocation which there was in the instructions of your court, with regard to the epoch which is to regulate the reduction of the maritime forces of Spain, making a due appreciation of my observations, which were founded in the express determination of the compact of neutrality.

<title>DECLARATION, DATED DOWNING-STREET, JAN. 1805.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00819">From the moment that hostilities had commenced between Great Britain and France, a sufficient ground of war against Spain, on the part of G. Britain, necessarily followed from the treaty of St. Ildephonso, if not disclaimed by Spain.&#x2014;That treaty, in fact, identified Spain with the republican govt. of France, by a virtual acknowledgment of unqualified vassalage, and by specific stipulations of unconditional offence,&#x2014;By the articles of that treaty Spain covenanted to furnish a stated contingent of naval and military force for the prosecution of any war in which the French republic might think proper to engage, She specifically surrendered any right or pretension to enquire into the nature, origin, or justice of that war. She stipulated, in the first instance, a contingent of troops and ships, which, of itself, comprises no moderate proportion of the means at her disposal; but in the event of this contingent being at any time found insufficient for the purposes of France, she fur-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0077"/>
<col>125</col>
ther bound herself to put into a state of activity the utmost force, both by sea and land, that it should be in her power to collect. She covenanted that this force should be at the disposal of France, to be employed conjointly or separately for the annoyance of the common enemy; thus submitting her entire power and resources to be used as the instruments of French ambition and aggression, and to be applied in whatever proportion France might think proper, for the avowed purpose of endeavouring to subvert the govt. and destroy the national existence of G. Britain.&#x2014;The character of such a treaty gave G. Brit, an incontestible right to declare to Spain, that unless she decidedly renounced the treaty, or gave assurances that she would not perform the obligations of it, she would not be considered as a neutral power.&#x2014;This right, however, for prudential reasons, and from motives of forbearance and tenderness towards Spain, was not exercised in its full extent; and, in consequence of assurances of a pacific disposition on the part of the Spanish govt. his maj. did not, in the first instance, insist on a distinct and formal renunciation of the treaty. It does not appear that any express demand of succour had been made by France before the month of July 1803; and on the first notification of the war, his maj.'s minister at the court of Madrid was led to believe, in consequence of communications which passed between him and the Spanish govt. that his Catholic maj. did not consider himself as necessarily bound by the mere fact of the existence of a war between G. Brit, and France, without subsequent explanation and discussion, to fulfil the stipulations of the treaty of St. Ildephonso, though the articles of that treaty would certainly give rise to a different interpretation. In the month of Oct. a convention was signed, by which Spain agreed to pay to France a certain sum monthly, in lieu of the naval and military succours which they had stipulated by the treaty to provide; but of the amount of this sum, or of the nature of any other stipulations which that convention might contain, no official information whatever was given.&#x2014;It was immediately slated by his maj.'s ministers at Madrid to the Spanish govt. that a subsidy as large as that which they were supposed to have engaged to pay to France, far exceeded the bounds of forbearance; that it could only meet with a temporary connivance, as, if it was con-
<col>126</col>
tinued, it might prove in fact a greater injury than any other hostility. In reply to these remonstrances, it was represented as an expedient to gain time, and assurances were given, which were confirmed by circumstances, which came to his maj.'s knowledge from other quarters, that the disposition of the Spanish govt. would induce them to extricate themselves from this engagement, if the course of events should admit of their doing so with safety. When his maj. had first reason to believe that such a convention was concluded, he directed his minister at the court of Madrid to declare that his forbearing to consider Spain as an enemy must depend in some degree upon the amount of the succours, and upon her maintaining a perfect neutrality in all other respects; but that it would be impossible for him to consider a permanent payment, to the amount of that which was stated to have been in agitation in any other light than as a direct subsidy for war. His maj.'s envoy was directed, therefore, first to protest against the convention, as a violation of neutrality, and a justifiable cause of war; secondly, to declare, that our abstaining from hostilities must depend upon its being only a temporary measure, and that we must be at liberty to consider a perseverance in it as a cause of war; thirdly, that the entrance of any French troops into Spain must be refused; fourthly, that any naval preparation must be a great cause of jealousy, and any attempt to give naval assistance to France an immediate cause of war; fifthly, that the Spanish ports must remain open to our commerce, and that our ships of war must have equal treatment with those of France. His maj.'s minister was also instructed, if any French troops entered Spain, or if he received authentic information of any naval armaments preparing for the assistance of France, to leave Madrid, and to give immediate notice to our naval commanders, that they might proceed to hostilities without the delay that might be occasioned by a reference home.&#x2014;The execution of these instructions produced a variety of discussions; during which his maj.'s minister told M. Cevallos, in answer to his question, Whether a continuance of such pecuniary succours to France would be considered as a ground of war, and whether he was authorised to declare it? that he was so authorised, and that war would be the infallible consequence.&#x2014;It was, however, still thought desirable by
<image src="S1V0003P0I0078"/>
<col>127</col>
his maj. to protract, if possible, the decision of this question; and it was therefore stated in the instructions to his minister at Madrid, that as the subsidy was represented by the Spanish govt. to be merely a temporary measure, his maj. might still continue to overlook it for a time; but that his decision hi this respect must depend upon knowing the precise nature of all the stipulations between Spain and France, and upon the Spanish govt. being determined to cause their neutrality to be respected in all other particulars. That until these questions were answered in a satisfactory manner, and the convention communicated to him, he could give no positive answer whether he would make the pecuniary succours a cause of war or not.&#x2014;Before the receipt of these instructions, dated Jan. 21, 1804, the report of some naval armaments in the ports of Spain had occasioned a fresh correspondence between his maj.'s minister and the Spanish govt. In one of the notes presented by the former, he declares, that if the king was forced to begin a war, he would want no other declaration than what he had already made. The answers of the Spanish govt. were at first of an evasive nature; his maj.'s minister closed the correspondence on his part by a note delivered on the 18th Feb. in which he declares that all farther forbearance on the part of England must depend upon the cessation of all naval armaments, and a prohibition of the sale of prizes in their ports; and unless these points were agreed to without modification, he had orders to leave Madrid. On the 2nd of these points a satisfactory-answer was given, and orders issued accordingly; on the 1st a reference was made to former declarations. To the question about disclosing the treaty with France, no satisfactory answer was ever given. As, however, no naval preparations appeared to be proceeding at that period in the ports of Spain, the matter was allowed to remain there for a time.&#x2014;In the month of July 1804, the govt. of Spain gave assurances of faithful and settled neutrality, and disavowed any orders to arm in their port; yet in the subsequent month, when these assurances were recent, and a confident reliance reposed in them, the British charge d'affaires received advice from the admiral commanding his maj.'s ships off the port of Ferrol, that reinforcements of Soldiers and sailors had arrived through Spain for the fleets at Toulon and Ferrol.
<col>128</col>
On this intelligence, two notes were presented to the Spanish ministers, but no answer received to either of them. Towards the end of the month of Sept. information was received in London from the British admiral stationed off Ferrol, that orders had actually been given by the court of Madrid for arming, without loss of time, at that port, 4 ships of the line, 2 frigates, and other smaller vessels; that (according to his intelligence) similar orders had been given at Carthagena and Cadiz, and particularly that 3 first-rate ships of the line were directed to sail from the last-mentioned port; and, as an additional proof of hostile intentions, that orders had been given to arm the pacquets as in time of war.&#x2014;Here then appeared a direct and unequivocal violation of the terms On which the continuance of peace had been acquiesced in; previous notice having been given to the Spanish govt. that a state of war would be the immediate consequence of such a measure, his maj. on this event stood almost pledged to an instant commencement of hostilities; the King, however, preferred a persevering adherence to the system of moderation so congenial to his disposition: he resolved to leave still an opening for accommodation, if Spain should be still allowed the liberty to adopt the course prescribed by a just sense of her own interests and security. It is here worthy of remark, that the groundless and ungrateful imputations thrown out against his maj.'s conduct in the Spanish manifesto, are built upon the foundation of this forbearance alone. Had his maj. exercised without reserve his just rights of war, the representations so falsely asserted, and so insidiously dwelt upon, could not have been even stated under any colourable pretext: the indulgence, therefore, which postponed the actual state of war, was not only misrepresented, but transformed into a ground of complaint, because the forbearance extended to the aggressors was not carried to a dangerous and inadmissible extreme. In consequence of the intelligence above stated, directions were sent to his maj.'s minister at Madrid, to make representations and remonstrances to the Spanish court, to demand explanations relative to the existing conventions between Spain and France; and, above all, to insist, that the naval armaments fit their ports should be placed on the same footing as they were previous to the com-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0079"/>
<col>129</col>
mencement of hostilities between G. Brit, and France: and he was further directed, explicitly to state to the Spanish govt. that his maj. felt a duty imposed upon him of taking, without delay', every measure of precaution; and particularly of giving orders to his admiral off the port of Ferrol, to prevent any of the Spanish ships of war sailing from that port, or any additional ships of war from entering it.&#x2014;No substantial redress, no satisfactory explanation, was afforded in consequence of these repeated representations; whilst, under the cover of his maj.'s forbearance, the enemy had received considerable remittances of treasure, together with the facility of procuring other supplies.&#x2014;Every circumstance of the general conduct of Spain was peculiarly calculated to excite the vigilant attention of the British govt.: the removal of Spanish ships out of their docks, to make room for the accommodation of the men of war of France; the march of French troops and seamen through the Spanish territory; the equipment of naval armaments at Ferrol; the consideration that the junction of this armament with the French ships already in that harbour, would create a decided superiority of numbers over his maj.'s squadron cruising off that port; the additional naval exertions, and the consequent increase of expence which this conduct of Spain necessarily imposed upon G. Brit. All these together required those precautions, both of representation and action, to which his maj. had immediate recourse. While official notice was given of his maj.'s intention to adopt those necessary measures, the Spanish govt. was at the same time assured, that his maj. still felt an earnest desire to maintain a good understanding with Spain; but that the continuance of such a state of things must be subject to the condition of abstaining on their part from all hostile preparations, and on making, without hesitation or reserve, that full and explicit disclosure of the nature and extent of the subsisting engagements with France, which had hitherto been so frequently and fruitlessly demanded; The precautions adopted by his maj. were such only as he deemed indispensably necessary to guard against the augmentation by Spain other means of naval preparation during the discussion, and against the possible consequences of the safe arrival of the expected American treasure in the Spanish ports; an event which, has more

than once, in former times, become the epoch of the termination of discussions, and of the commencement of hostility on the part of Spain.&#x2014;The orders issued by his maj. on this occasion, to the admirals commanding his fleets, afford the most striking example of a scrupulous and indulgent forbearance; the most strict limitation was given as to the extent and object of the measures proposed; and the execution of those orders was guarded with the strongest injunctions to avoid, by every means consistent with the attainment of their object, any act of violence or hostility against the dominions or subjects of his Cath. maj. The hostile preparations in the harbour of Ferrol rendered it necessary, in the first instance, that a reinforcement should be added to the squadron cruizing off that port; and orders were, at the same time, conveyed to the British admirals, to send intimation to the Spanish govt. of the instructions they had received, and of their determination in consequence to resist, under the present circumstances, the sailing either of the French or Spanish fleets, if any attempt for that purpose should be made by either of them.&#x2014;His maj.'s pleasure was at the same signified, that they were not to detain, in the first instance, any ship belonging to his Cath. maj. sailing from a port of Spain; but to require the commander of such ship to return directly to the port from whence she came, and only, in the event of his refusing to comply with such requisition, to detain or send her to Gibraltar, or to England.&#x2014;Further directions were given not to detain any Spanish homeward-bound ships of war, unless they should have treasure on board, nor merchant ships of that nation, however laden, on any account whatsoever. That, in the prosecution of these measures of precaution, many valuable lives should have been sacrificed, is a subject of much regret to his maj. who laments it as an event produced alone by an unhappy concurrence of circumstances, but which in no degree affect the merits of the case. The question of the just principle, and due exercise of his maj.'s right, rests upon every foundation of the laws of nature and of nations, which enjoin and justify the adoption of such measures as are requisite for defence, and the prevention of aggression.&#x2014;It remains only further to observe, that if any additional proof were requisite of the wisdom and necessity of precautionary measures, that proof would be found even

in the declaration relied upon in the manifesto of Spain, in which its govt. now states itself to have contemplated from the beginning of the war, the necessity of making itself a party to it, in support of the pretensions of France, expressly declaring, that "Spain and Holland, who treated conjointly with France at Amiens, and whose interests and political relations were so closely connected with her, must have with difficulty refrained from taking part against the injuries and insults offered to their ally.&#x2014;It will further appear by a reference to the dates and results of the several representations made by his maj.'s charge d'affaires at the court of Spain, that the detention of the Spanish treasure ships never was in question during the discussions which preceded his departure from Madrid. That ground of complaint, therefore, which has since been so much relied upon, formed no part of the motive of the previous hostile character so strongly manifested by the Spanish court in their mode of treating the points in discussion, nor, as will appear in the sequel, of the final rupture of the negotiation at Madrid.&#x2014;On the 26th of Oct. 1804, his maj.'s charge d'affaires presented a note to the Spanish minister, in which the following conditions were insisted upon, as preliminary to the appointment of a minister from G. Brit, who might treat of the adjustment of other matters which remained for discussion. The conditions were three, first, "that the orders given at Ferrol Cadiz, and Carthagena, should be countermanded, as well for the equipment of ships of war in any of those ports as for their removal from one of those ports to another. 2d, that not only the present armaments should be discontinued, but that the establishment of ships of war in the different ports should be replaced on the footing on which they stood at the commencement of hostilities between England and France. 3d. that a full disclosure should be made of the existing engagements, and of the future intentions of Spain with respect to France. From the period above-mentioned to the 2d of Nov. several official notes passed between his maj.'s charge d'affaires and the Spanish minister, consisting, with little variation in their tenor, of urgent demands of satisfaction on the one side, and of evasive and unsatisfactory replies on the other. After repeated delays and reiterated applications, his maj.'s charge d'affaires received his passports on the 7th of Nov. and departed from Madrid on the 14th of that month, During
<col>132</col>
the whole of this negotiation, no mention was made of the detention of the Spanish treasure ships, nor does it any where appear, that an account had been received at Madrid of that transaction. It is evident, therefore, notwithstanding the attempt made by the Spanish court to avail itself of that event, in the manifesto which has been since published, that the state of war must equally have arisen between G. Brit, and Spain, had the detention never taken place; and that, in point of fact, the rupture ultimately took place upon grounds distinct from, and totally unconnected with, that measure.&#x2014;The leading circumstances which characterise the reiterated abuse of his maj.'s moderation, were each of them of a nature to have exhausted any less settled system of lenity and forbearance. Succours afforded to his enemies; explanations refused or evaded, after repeated demands; conditions violated, after distinct notice, that on them depended the continuance of peace. Such has been the conduct of the Spanish court; and it is, under these circumstances, that his maj. finds the domineering influence of France exerted, and the Spanish nation in a state of declared and open war.&#x2014;His maj. appeals with confidence to all Europe for the acknowledgment of his exemplary moderation in the whole course of these transactions. His maj. feels, with regret, the necessity which places him in a state of hostility with Spain; and would, with heartfelt satisfaction observe, on the part of that country, the assumption of a more dignified sense of national importance, and a more independent exercise of sovereign rights.&#x2014;His maj. would, indeed, be most happy to discover in the councils of Spain, a reviving sense of those ancient feelings and honourable propensities, which have at all times been so congenial to the Spanish character, and which, in better limes, have marked the conduct of its govt. His maj. will, on his part, eagerly embrace the first, opportunity thus offered, of resuming a state of peace and confidence with a nation, which has so many ties of common interest to connect it with G. Brit, and which he has hitherto been ever disposed to regard with sentiments of the utmost consideration and esteem.</p>

<col>134</col>
panies of the city of London, in common council assembled, at the Guildhall of the said city, on Wednesday, the 29th of Sept. 1802.&#x2014;<i>Resolved unanimously.</i> "that the thanks of this common hall be given to Sir W. Rawlins, knt. and R. A. Cox, esq. late sheriffs of this city, and late sheriff of the county of Middlesex, for their firm, manly, and conscientious discharge of the various important duties of that high office, in a year of unprecedented public duty, for their-liberality and humane attention to the several prisoners confided to their care; and for the zeal they have manifested in support of the rights and privileges of their fellow citizens, and of the British constitution, by preserving inviolate that great bulwark of public liberty, the freedom of election&#x2014;Woodthorpe;" and the petitioners state, that while in the execution of such office of sheriffs of the city of London, the petitioners having, upon the election aforesaid of four citizens to represent the said city in parliament, returned sir W. Curtis, bait, sir J. W. Anderson, bart. H. C. Combe, esq. and sir C. Price, bart. to represent the same, a petition was, by sir W. Lewes, knt. an unsuccessful candidate at such election, presented to the house against the return of the four citizens aforesaid, and against the petitioners, for making such return as sheriffs of the city of London aforesaid; which petition being by the house referred to a select committee appointed to try and determine the same, was by such committee voted frivolous and vexatious; and the petitioners were thereby entitled to be reimbursed the heavy costs and damages they had been put to in defending themselves against such unjust charge so brought against them.; but, from the distressed circumstances of the said sir W. Lewes, knt. the petitioners have not to this hour, nor are at any time hereafter likely to be, reimbursed the same, or any the smallest part thereof; and that two other petitions were presented to the house; the one by W. Mainwaring, esq. the unsuccessful candidate at the said election for the county of Middlesex; and the other by certain freeholders of the said county in his interest, complaining of the return made by the petitioners of sir F. Burdett, bart. And charging the petitioners, as sheriffs of Middlesex, and returning officers at such last-mentioned election for that county, with great partiality in favour of the said sir F. Burdett, and with other undue conduct in the course and progress of the said
<image src="S1V0003P0I0082"/>
<col>135</col>
election and poll; which said two petitions were by the house referred to a select committee of the house, which was duly ballotted for and appointed on Friday, the 3d of February, 1804, and continued from that day to sit on the trial of the same petitions until Monday the 9th of July last; and that, on the said 9th of July, the chairman of the said committee acquainted the house (among other things) that the committee had determined, that the said election and return for the said county of Middlesex were void, so far as respected the said sir F. Burdett; and that the committee had also come to the four following resolutions relative to the petitioners, viz. 1st. That on the 13th, 14th, and 15th days of the poll, on the first of which days there was a considerable majority of votes in favour of W. Mainwaring, esq. the sheriff R. A. Cox, esq. and sir W. Rawlins, knt. wilfully, knowingly, and corruptly, did admit to poll for Sir F. Burdett, bart. upwards of 300 persons claiming to vote under a fictitious right, as proprietors of a mill purported to be situated in the parish of Isleworth, and called the "Good Intent Mill," by which means a colourable majority was obtained in favour of sir F. Burdett, 2d. That on the 15th day, towards the close of the poll, after such majority was established, they rejected persons tendering their votes under the same circumstances. 3d. That the sheriff at the poll acted in a judicial capacity, by admitting counsel to argue the validity of votes, and by deciding, in some instances, on the validity of such votes; that in other instances they refused to decide on the validity of votes which were objected to, and stated that they would admit any person to poll who would take the oaths, declaring themselves to be only ministerial officers, thereby acting in a manner contradictory to their practice in other cases, and in flagrant violation of their duty. 4th. That the obvious tendency of their conduct was to admit persons who had no right to poll, and to afford the greatest encouragement to perjury; and that the petitioners, being ignorant of the law, did, during the whole course of the said election, constantly and invariably act under the advice of their under-sheriffs and deputy under-sheriff, all of whom are attornies, highly respectable in their profession, and long conversant in the law, and one of them for above 20 years practised in the judicial decision of questions of the greatest value and importance; and
<col>136</col>
that on the 13th of the said last-mentioned election, when the proprietors of the mill, as mentioned in the above report of the said select committee of the house, first tendered themselves to vote, their right to vote at such election, for such freehold was argued very much at length by different counsel on each side; and alter such argument the petitioners did (by the advice of the aforesaid deputy under-sheriff, and one of the under-sheriffs, who were then and there present during the whole course of such argument, the other under-sheriff not being on the said 13th day in attendance) uniformly admit such of them to vote as stated themselves upon oath to have been 12 months in possession of shares of the value of 40s. a year, and did as uniformly reject such of them as appeared not to have been 12 months in possession, or not to have shares of that annual value, the petitioners acting therein in conformity to the advice aforesaid, and that the petitioners admitted the said last-mentioned persons to vote, from, a full and perfect conviction at the time of the legality of their claim, established in the minds of the petitioners by the repeated arguments of counsel, and the solemn oath of the parties; and they do conscientiously and sacredly declare, that, in the admission of those, as well as all other voters during the whole continuance of the aforesaid election, they acted with the most pure and upright intention, without partiality to one candidate, or prejudice against the other; and that the petitioners humbly state, that, though in particular instances they did heap questions argued by counsel, yet they did not consider themselves invested with a judicial authority, for the petitioners were instructed to conceive, and did and do. still conceive, that any freeholder, who tenders himself to take the respective oaths required by divers acts of parliament, to be taken at a county election, is entitled to have such oaths administered to him, and to vote thereat, and that such persons would be rejected at the peril of an action for damages, to be brought against the returning officers so rejecting them; nevertheless the petitioners confess that, in divers instances, they did take such peril upon themselves when the justice and equity of the case seemed, to warrant them in so proceeding, though not compellable by law so to do; and, in order to satisfy and protect themselves in the execution of this part of their office, they were frequently willing and de-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0083"/>
<col>137</col>
sirous to hear the arguments of counsel as a guide and assistance to the conduct of the petitioners, but not as a right to be claimed by either candidate; and that the petitioners further state, that they, in divers instances, as well relating to other tenements as to the mill tenement aforesaid, when it appeared to them, by the confession of the parties claiming a right to vote, that they had not been in possession of their freehold for 12 months, or that it was not of the annual value of 40s. did reject such persons; and the petitioners submit to this house that, from the aforesaid causes, they may seem sometimes to have acted ministerially, and at other times judicially, but at no time did they act from any interested or unworthy motives, but, on the contrary, from an anxious and earnest desire to do justice to all parties, though at the peril of an action against themselves; and the petitioners pursued this line of conduct equally in respect to voters tendering their votes for the aforesaid W. Mainwaring, esq. and sir F. Burdett, particularly in respect to very many persons claiming a right to vote by virtue of certain offices, some of which were held under the dean and chapter of Westminster, such as bell-ringers and butlers, organ-blowers and choiristers, cooks and gardeners, and who were admitted by the petitioners on the poll for the said W. Mainwaring, esq. and afterwards struck off such poll by the committee aforesaid; and that the petitioners humbly hope, since the greatest legal characters have differed concerning the nature of the duties, and power of a returning officer at an election of a knight to represent a county in parliament, that they shall not incur the censure of the house if, in the execution of their office, they sometimes appear to have been misled by contradictory arguments, which in the case of Ashby and White divided the opinions of the court of king's bench, where Lord Holt at that time presided as chief justice; and that those persons who, on the 15th day, claimed a right to vote for the mill tenement were rejected, because it appeared from their own confession, when the oath was tendered to them, that they had not been possessed of their freehold for the space of 12 months before the election, whereas those who were admitted on the 13th and 14th days, took the freeholder's oath, of the nature and effect of which they were solemnly warned and instructed at the time; and that the votes of the description above-
<col>138</col>
mentioned were not rejected on the 15th day, because sir. F. Burdett had then secured a majority of numbers on the poll, for the petitioners humbly state, that many of that description were rejected both in the early and latter part of that day, as well before as after such majority appears to have been obtained; and that the petitioners are informed that, at the election in July last of a knight of the shire in the room of sir F. Burdett, several of the proprietors of the said mill, called the Good Intent, tendered their votes, and that by the advice of Newman Knowlys, esq. barrister at law, and common serjeant of the city of London, who was assessor to the then sheriff, the then sheriff did not consider such proprietors to be fictitious voters, but did, after various arguments on each side, admit such of the said mill proprietors to poll who stated themselves upon oath to have been in possession 12 months of shares of the value of 40s. a year, and rejected others who had not been for that length of time in possession of such shares, or whose shares were not of that annual value, pursuing therein the same rule and line of conduct that the petitioners had adopted in the former election; and that the petitioners, with all humility, submit themselves to the sentence of the house, assured as they are that in its wisdom and its justice it will consider the arduous duty imposed on the petitioners as returning officers at the aforesaid election; and that no evidence whatever was, or has been, or could have been adduced, to shew any interested motive, personal or political, by which the petitioners were influenced in their conduct, and the petitioners solemnly declare, and are ready, if they might be permitted, to attest the same on oath, that, throughout the whole of such conduct, they never did in a single instance willfully transgress the line of their duty, but uniformly acted to the best of their knowledge, and that without favour or affection, prejudice or malice, towards any, person or party; and that the petitioners most humbly state to the house, that whatever may have appeared blameable in the execution of their office has arisen from the difficulty and novelty of their situation, and from their general ignorance of the law, which, however, they most anxiously endeavoured to correct (but are sorry to have found how unsuccessfully) by acting under the immediate judgment of professional persons, of great character and long ex-

perience; and that the petitioners are in formed, that the said report of the said select committee is ordered by the house to be taken into consideration on Tuesday, the 29th of Jan. inst. and therefore praying to be heard, by themselves, or by their counsel, at the bar of the house, and that the house will grant them such relief in the premises, as to its justice shall seem meet."&#x2014;Ordered, that the said petition do lie upon the table.<lb/>
A petition of the several persons, whose names are thereunto subscribed, was delivered in at the table, and read; setting forth, "that the petitioners are freeholders of the county of Middlesex, and claim to have had a right to vote at the last election for that county; that at such election sir F. Burdett, bart. and G. B. Mainwaring, esq. were candidates to represent the said county in parliament; that upon a shew of hands the sheriff J. Shaw, esq. and sir W. Leighton, knt. declared the majority, on the view, to be in favour of sir P. Burdett, but a poll being duly demanded for the said election, the same was granted by the said sheriff, and commenced on the 23d of July, 1804; that the said poll continued open 011 the first day till about 5 o'clock in the evening; that on every other day during the continuance of the same, the poll was kept open 7 hours; that on divers days during such continuance, several persons attended at the booth, appointed according to law, to give their votes, and did accordingly declare their votes to be in favour of sir F. Burdett, whose names, places of abode, and freeholds, and in whose occupations their freeholds were, were duly entered on the poll, but the sheriff refused to permit the scratches or marks to be set opposite to their names, denoting the candidate for whom they voted, until their titles to vote had been examined into, although they offered to substantiate their titles by their oaths, nor would the sheriff allow such examination to take place at the booth, but insisted on their attending in a box, placed in a different part of the hustings, to undergo such examination; and although such persons, in compliance with such requisition, did accordingly attend at the said box, yet the consideration of many votes so-circumstanced, was adjourned, for want of time, till the days respectively succeeding, and thereby great delay and confusion arose; that in order to prevent the same in future, application was at sundry times, by the agents, friends, and
<col>140</col>
counsel of sir F. Burdett, made to the sheriff of the said county, to keep the poll; open longer than 7 hours, as by law he was bound to do when upon good and sufficient cause requested so to do; that the said sheriff, at the several times aforesaid, refused to accede to such application, that on the 14th and 15th days of the poll, the said sheriff, together with Newman Knowlys, esq. who then and there sat as assessor, or assistant to the said sheriff, severally, and at sundry times declared, that if at 3 o'clock on the said 15th day the votes of any persons that had been before that time objected to should not have been examined, the said sheriff would proceed upon such examination, and determine on the same after 3 o'clock on the same, or the following day; and the petitioners further state, that at 3 o'clock on the 15th day of the poll, several voters were in attendance at the sheriff's box, in obedience to orders given by the sheriff, waiting to be examined in respect to the titles to their votes, which had been previously entered on the poll, and their votes declared, some for the said G. B. Mainwaring, but many more for the said sir F. Burdett; and the petitioners humbly submit, that if the poll had been cast up at such hour, without any further examination of such voters, the names of such voters ought to have been reckoned, and thereby a majority of votes received on the poll declared, as in foot it was, in favour of sir F. Burdett; but the petitioners further state, that the poll was not cast up, nor the numbers declared, till the following day, and, in the mean time, the sheriff, in compliance with his aforesaid promise, proceeded to satisfy himself respecting the titles of the voters so previously entered on the poll, and, after such examination, directed marks to be set opposite to their names, some in favour of the said sip F. Burdett, and some for the said G. B. Mainwaring, according to the votes previously given for one or other of the said candidates; that a majority of the votes received on the poll did thereby also appear in favour of sir F. Burdett, and the said sir F. Burdett ought to have been returned to serve in this present parliament for the county aforesaid; and that the said sheriff, well knowing the premises, did, on the 16th day of the said election, illegally, wrongfully, wilfully, and falsely declare the majority of numbers to be in favour of the said G. B. Mainwaring, and illegally, wilt fully, wrongfully, and falsely, returned the

<col>141</col>
said G. B. Mainwaring to serve for the said county in the present parliament, although the said sir F. Burdett had a majority in number of votes received on the poll in his favour, and ought to have been returned in the stead and place of the said G. B. Mainwaring to serve in the present parliament for the county of Middlesex aforesaid; and therefore praying the house to order the said false return of the said sheriff to be amended, by directing the name of the said G. B. Mainwaring to be erased there from, and the name of the said sir F. Burdett to be inserted therein in the stead and place of the name of the said G. B. Mainwaring, and that the house will appoint an early day for taking their petition into consideration, and grant to the petitioners such further relief in the premises as to the house shall seem meet."&#x2014;Ordered, that the said petition be taken into consideration upon Tuesday, the 19th of Feb. next, and that Mr. Speaker do issue his warrant or warrants for such persons, papers, and records, as shall be thought necessary by the several parties on the hearing of the matter of the said petition.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-00822"><member>Mr. Windham</member><membercontribution> rose for the purpose of making a motion, to which, he trusted, there could be no objection. It referred to a point upon which, when he brought forward his motions a few days since, it was his wish to have obtained full and distinct information. He was still of opinion, that it would be necessary to procure information separately on this head, in order to enable the house, when the situation of the military circumstances of the country should come to be discussed, to form a clear and impartial opinion upon it. He had been led to give up this motion by a spirit of accommodation to the right hon. gent. on the other side of the house, and to generalise the motions he on that occasion submitted; but as it often happened, that whilst acting under such an impulse, a man might concede more than upon reflection he would deem consistent with prudence or discretion, he proposed in the present instance, to correct his former omission by a specific motion. His object in making it was, to ascertain the number of men that had been raised in col. French's levy. He was aware, that as his former motions took in the new levies in England, Ireland, and Scotland, it might be said that his present motion was included in one of them. But* as the only inconve-
<col>142</col>
nience that could be apprehended from it would be, that col. French's levy would be returned in the double, that inconvenience would be obviated by his moving for a separate return of that levy. He therefore moved, "that there be laid before the house a separate return of the number of effective men raised for the levy now recruiting by col. French, for general service, in the united kingdom; distinguishing the number of recruits finally approved, up to the last return; also the number that bad received bounties as boys, and the number of officers appointed iii that levy."

He wished gentlemen to be put in possession of the most satisfactory and comprehensive information on the subject, and with a view to that object, should move, "that there be laid before the house, an account of the total amount of his maj.'s regular, militia, and provincial forces, on the 1st of Jan. 1804, and the 1st of Jan. 1805, respectively, distinguishing the limited from the unlimited force, and cavalry from infantry; and also those serving in G.

<title>[WAR WITH SPAIN.]&#x2014;</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00824"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> then rose, for the purpose of giving notice of several motions, which it was his intention to submit to the house on Monday. After all the attention which it had been in his power to bestow on the papers relative to the new war in which we were now unfortunately engaged, in the short period since they had been distributed, it appeared to him, that there were many important omissions, which it was material to have supplied before the main question should be discussed, and to enable the house to form a just and impartial opinion on the merits of the case. It could not be denied, that on so solemn and momentous a question, every information ought to be given to parliament, as far as it might be consistent with the interests of the public service. It was with a view, therefore, to supply the omissions which appeared to him in the papers laid before the house, that he proposed to bring forward the motions of which he then gave notice. The
<image src="S1V0003P0I0086"/>
<col>143</col>
precise objects to which they would relate were, some further information respecting the correspondence between lords Hawkesbury and Harrowby, and air Frere, and the discussions, if any, that might have taken place between the Spanish minister here and his maj.'s govt. There were other points, also, on which information was necessary, but as he did not conceive any objection that could be made to granting it, he was not equally inclined to think it necessary to give any previous notice of his motions respecting such topics. It would be felt generally how very desirable it was to have all the information that could possibly be procured on the subject as early as may be, before it should come tinder discussion. As, however, there might be some objection to the immediate production of the information he wished to obtain, which he could not then foresee, it might be more regular to read the motions he proposed to make in that instance, previous to his moving the question on any of them, that he might discover how the right hon. gent, opposite would feel, with respect to them, and if there should be any difficulty in acceding to them he had no objection to let them stand over, noticed with his other motions for Monday. The hon. gent, then read the string of motions he had prepared, the object of which was, to obtain copies or extracts of all dispatches or letters from sir E. Pellew and adm. Cochrane, relative to the state of the ports of Ferrol and Corunna, and the armaments said to have been carried on in them; also relative to the sale of prizes in the ports of Spain, in Europe and America; and to the quantity of naval and military stores supplied to our squadrons from the ports of Spain since the commencement of the present war.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00825"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> expressed a wish, that the hon. member would postpone his motions till Monday, on the ground that it might be necessary to consider how far it would be proper to comply with them, consistently with the public service.&#x2014;The motions were then noticed for Monday.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00826"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> next intimated an opinion, that it would be desirable to have the object of the hon. gent's other motions more specifically stated, in order to afford an opportunity of considering them, previous to their being submitted to the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00827"><member>Mr. Grey,</member><membercontribution> in explanation of his object,
<col>144</col>
stated, that his wish was to have the omissions appearing in the papers before the house, supplied as fully as possible. In the first packet of instructions transmitted by Lord Hawkesbury to Mr. Frere, forming the first document in the published papers, there was a reference to previous communications, which, as they did not appear, it was his wish to obtain. Another object was to obtain copies of the discussions that must necessarily have taken place during the chasms of many months that appeared in the papers, for the purpose of completing the links of discussion, from the first question of difference to the final rupture; and lastly, he wished to have the house put in possession of the discussions that might have taken place between the Spanish ministers and our govt. here; and also the communications that might have been made to our minister by the Spanish govt. after his demand for his passports.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[CONDUCT OF JUDGE FOX.]&#x2014;</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00829"><member>The Marquis of Abercorn</member><membercontribution> moved, that the order for their lordships going into a committee upon the matters alleged against Mr. Justice Fox, and the papers and documents respecting the same, on the 7th of Feb. be discharged. This the noble marquis generally stated, he was principally induced to do by the consideration of the great distance many of the witnesses who were meant to be brought forward on the occasion, had necessarily to travel; some from remote parts of Ireland, and to whom it would be impracticable to arrive in due time, in reference to the day at first appointed for the commencement of the investigation. Under this impression, and with a view to the circumstances of this case, he should propose that a similar order be made for the is 18th of Feb. which his lordship seemed to think the earliest
<image src="S1V0003P0I0087"/>
<col>145</col>
practicable day.&#x2014;This proposition meeting the concurrence of their lordships, the order as above was forthwith discharged, and renewed for the 18th of next month. The noble marquis then moved, that a message be sent to the Commons, requesting they would permit the' attendance of the following members of that house, to give evidence before the said committee, namely, sir T. Featherstone, bart. hon. G. L. Cole, sir James Stewart, bart. and M. Archdall, esq. Ordered.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[ADDITIONAL FORCE BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00830"><member>Earl Camden</member><membercontribution> presented, in pursuance of a recent address of their lordships, accounts of the number of men raised under the provisions of the additional force act passed last session. The accounts were ordered to lie on the table, and to be printed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00831"><member>Earl Darnley</member><membercontribution> observed, that he still found it necessary to ask for further information upon this subject. He wished to know specifically, what number of men had been raised by the parishes; for which purpose he should now make a motion, to which he thought there could be no objection, for an account, distinguishing the number of men so raised by the medium of the parish officers, distinct from those raised by the ordinary means of levy. He did not wish to enter now into the general question upon the subject which he intended to bring forward on Monday next, but upon a very cursory view of the papers upon the table, he could not help observing, that he thought they completely justified the objections which were originally, made to the Addiditional Force Act, as it appeared to him, that out of the number of men raised, since the last session, very few had been obtained within the united kingdom. He should merely, however, now move for the production of the paper to which he had alluded, and he should then move that the lords be summoned for Monday, upon his motion respecting the army.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00832"><member>Earl Camden</member><membercontribution> observed, he saw no objection to the accounts being produced, which his noble friend adverted to; but, with respect to the day upon which the intended proposition should be discussed, the same facility, in his mind, did not seem to obtain. There were, on the other hand, other papers and accounts, which, he thought, were necessary to be produced, and which it might not be practicable to get ready in due time; besides, there was a discussion of great importance
<col>146</col>
pending, and which, perhaps, circumstances might render it necessary to have postponed. He had rather his noble friend would fix upon another day; as, by possible contingency, that mentioned might interfere with the important discussion which he alluded to as pending.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00833"><member>Earl Darnley</member><membercontribution> explained, and expressed himself desirous that no proposition coming from him should stand in the way of any other business of more importance. However, as the thing stood, he did not see what well-grounded objection could be offered to summoning their 1dps. for Monday next. He repeated some of his former observations relative to the inefficacy of parts of the act in question; and concluded by framing a motion for producing the farther accounts, as above described, which, after a few words from Earl Camden, was put and ordered accordingly.</membercontribution></p>

Burdett, bart. and G. B. Mainwaring, esq. were candidates to represent the same county in parliament; that, on the shew of hands, the then sheriff declared the majority to be in favor of the said sir F.

<p id="S1V0003P0-00837"><member>Col.

<p id="S1V0003P0-00839"><member>Col. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> observed, that in that case some degree of blame attached to the secretary at war for not bringing them in sooner. If the public service absolutely required that they should be discussed on Monday next, and if they could not conveniently be printed before that time, then be would acquiesce. But they certainly ought to have been presented in proper time to have them printed. It was impossible that the members of the house could accurately examine their contents while they lay unprinted on the table, and he should therefore think it his duty to persevere in his intention of moving chat they should be printed, unless it was positively 6tated, that this would be injurious to the public service.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[WAK WITH SPAIN.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00841"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> rose and stated, that as he by no means wished to anticipate the full discussion of the Spanish business, which was so soon to take place, and as he understood that no material objections were likely to be made to the motions which he was about to submit to the house, he should not occupy their time with many preparatory remarks. During the long negotiation which had preceded our rupture with Spain, much must have passed of which the house were yet ignorant. In the official correspondence that had been laid before them, there were numerous chasma which he wished to see supplied, and it was for this purpose that he had prepared the motions which he had prepared the motions which he now held in his hand. When our govt. received the first information of the pecuniary succours afforded by Spain to France, it must have been productive of minute instructions to our ambassador at Madrid, and of considerable discussions with the Spanish govt. His first motion,
<col>150</col>
therefore, was, for "copies or extracts of all letters from his maj.'s minister at the court of Madrid, relating to the demands made for succours by France to Spain in July 1803, with the instructions sent to the said minister thereupon, and an account of all the discussions which took place on that subject with the Spanish govt." To Mr. Frere's note of the 9th Sept. 1803, addressed to the Spanish minister, and complaining of the passage of 1500 Trench artillery-men through Spain, no answer appeared; in all probability, some answer must have been received; indeed, lord Hawkesbury, in a subsequent letter, adverts to this subject in such a manner, as to prove that no answer had been received, he should therefore move for "a copy or extract of any answer given by the court of Madrid to Mr. Frere's. note of the 9th Sept. 1803, respecting the passage of a body of artillery-men and marines through Spain to reinforce the French fleet at Ferrol; and also, an account of all explanations which may have taken place with the Spanish govt. and of all assurances received from the same, respecting the passage of French troops or seamen in general, since the commencement of the war with France." There now appeared a vacuum in the correspondence of upwards of 3 months. It was impossible but that, during this long period, a great deal of interesting and important correspondence must have passed between our court and that of Spain, more especially with regard to the pecuniary succours afforded to France by the govt. of Madrid, he should, therefore, move for "copies or extracts of all letters from Mr. Frere to our court, between the 12th Sept. and the 27th Dec. 1803, relative to the money paid by the Spanish govt. for the use of France, together with copies or extracts of the instructions sent to the said minister I thereupon." In lord Hawkesbury's letter of the 21st Jan. 1804, reference was again I made to the pecuniary succours which France had received from Spain. On this subject he thought we ought to receive the; most ample and satisfactory explanation. He would, therefore, move, for "copies or extracts of all correspondence explanatory of the pecuniary succours from Spain to France, alluded to in lord Hawkesbury's f letter to Mr. Frere, dated Jan. 21, 1801." In the course of the correspondence between our ambassador and M. Cevallos, allusions were frequently made to a con-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0090"/>
<col>151</col>
vention between England and Spain. Of every thing relative to this convention, it one did exist, we ought to be most fully and minutely informed; his next motion, therefore, should be for "a copy of any convention, contract, or agreement, which may have been entered into between G. Brit, and Spain, respecting the neutrality to be observed by the latter power during the present war with France." Another long interval now appeared in the correspondence. From the 21st Jan. 1804, to the 22d May, 1804, not a single letter or a. single instruction from our govt. to Mr. Frere was to be found. To fill up this hiatus, he would move for "copies or extracts of all correspondence that had passed between Mr. Frere and lord Hawkesbury from the 21st Jan. 1804, to the 22d May, 1804." At this latter period the new administration came into office. Lord Harrowby succeeded Lord Hawkesbury, but of tins noble lord's letters to Mr. Frere we had but 3 given to us, one on the 22d May, another on the 29th Sept. and the last on the 21st Oct. 1804. It cannot have escaped the observation of the house, that in some of Mr. B. Frere's latter notes to M. Cevallos, his demands for passports are more urgent, and the expression of his determination not to remain in Madrid, unless he obtains a satisfactory answer to his requisitions more strong than what his authority in the letters from our govt. laid before the house seems completely to warrant. There must still remain a portion of the correspondence of which the house were not in possession, and to endeavour to procure this, he would move for "copies or extracts of all instructions to Mr. B. Frere, subsequent to the 22d May." It was highly probable, as the Spanish minister at our court and our govt. must have had frequent discussions on the important negotiations that were going on at Madrid, that some notes expressive of the sentiments of each party must have passed between them; he should therefore move for "copies or extracts of all official notes or letters that may have passed between the Spanish minister at our court relative to the points in dispute." By some accident, as he imagined, the letter of Adm. Cochrane, on which lord Harrowby's dispatch to Mr. Frere, dated the 29th Sept. 1804, sind giving an account of the armaments, or supposed armaments, at the Spanish ports was founded, had been omitted in the papers laid before the house. Tim was a
<col>152</col>
material letter, and it was likewise very material to ascertain the period at which it was received. For these reasons, he should move for "a copy of the letter of Adm. Cochrane, containing the information referred to in lord Harrowby's dispatch of the 29th of September, 1804, respecting the naval preparations in Ferrol." In Admiral Cochrane's letter of the 11th Sep. 1804, he describes the formidable state of the Spanish naval force in the port of Ferrol, and in his letter of 21st of Oct. which is the next in the papers laid before the house, he says," The Spanish ships, here are in the same state as when I wrote last." Now, the fact was, that between those periods of the 11th Sep. and 21st of Oct. those ships had gone back to the arsenal Some necessary, letters therefore, of Adm. Cochrane's, had been omitted; and he should move for "copies or extracts of all letters that may have been received from. Adm. Cochrane, giving an account of the state and force of the Spanish ships in the harbours of Ferrol and Corunna, between Sep. 11, and'Oct. 21, 1804." In Adm. Cochrane's letter he speaks of the preparations in Cadiz and Carthagena. It would be highly desirable to obtain the original authority from which he derived his information, he would therefore move for "an account of all intelligence sent by his maj.'s consuls at Cadiz and Carthargena, and by any officers of his maj.'snavy, respecting any naval preparations there, and of the state of the arsenals." The hon. gent, concluded by observing, that still to add other links to the chain of information which he wished the house to possess, he should move further for "copies of all accounts transmitted by Sir E. Pellew, describing the state of the French and Spanish ships in Ferrol and Corunna. Copies or extracts of all letters from Sir T. Duckworth, respecting the conduct observed by the Spanish governor at Cuba, relative to the sale of British prizes since the commencement of the war with France; and accounts of all supplies of stores and provisions furnished by Spain to the squadrons under the command of Sir E. Pellew, and Adm. Cochrane."&#x2014;On the first motion being put,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00842"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> rose. He said, he allowed, that every means which would enable the house to discuss mope completely the weighty question which was soon to be submitted to it, was of importance; and in this view he was willing to consider the motions which the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0091"/>
<col>153</col>
hon. gent. has framed with the wish of procuring information. With regard to the motions proposed by the hon. gent. no material objection occurred to him at present against their production: but at the same time, from the great number of motions, from the variety of objects which they embraced, and from the very cursory glance that he had been afforded of them, it was impossible for him to undertake to say how far some of them could be complied with. Of many of the papers required, he had no doubt that govt. were not in possession; others, though perhaps not many, might exist; however he trusted that the house and the hon. gent. would be satisfied with his assurance, that every exertion would be made to give them as full information on all the subjects of the motions, as it was in the power of govt. to procure; and that where the whole of the papers could not be brought forward, those parts should be produced which it might be possible to obtain. He should avail himself of the motions being put from the chair, to make' some slight observations on some of them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00843"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> expressed himself perfectly satisfied with the assurance of the right hon. gent, he wished the spirit of his motions to be adhered to rather than the letter.&#x2014;The motions were put separately and agreed to, until that for laying before the house any compact or convention of neutrality that might have been entered into with Spain. On this being put,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00844"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> assured the house that he had not the slightest objection to the production of such a paper if such a paper could be found; but he could not omit the present opportunity of stating, that whatever might have been asserted by the Spanish minister, or however inadvertently the term may have been used by Mr. Frere, it was certain that no such compact, or convention, respecting the Spanish neutrality, had been in any shape entered into. There was not a single note, letter, or word of explanation which at all even alluded to any such compact.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00845"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> thought this part of the subject of infinite importance. From what he could understand of it the Spanish minister had given to something that had passed between the two courts, the name of convention, and this name Mr. Frere, in his subsequent discussions with that minister, is said to have used inadvertently. Though he could not conceive the probability of
<col>154</col>
Mr. Frere's inadvertently using this term in the first instance, when, perhaps, he did not attach to it much importance, yet he confessed he was totally at a loss to conceive the possibility of his making use of it, in serious and repeated discussions, without his having some solid grounds for so doing. It was obvious that Mr. Frere had repeatedly spoken to M. Cevallos of this convention; now, unless it could be supposed that he would talk of that which, had positively no existence, it must be allowed that he had some reasons to induce him to use the term which were kept from the knowledge of parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00846"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, he had before expressed his willingness to give the house all possible information on this subject, but he again assured them, that all the information that govt. could afford them, was already in their possession. However the Spanish minister or Mr. Frere may have dwelt on the word convention, there was no paper or document whatever that bore the slightest reference to such an agreement; there never had been in any shape whatever any recognizance of a treaty of neutrality with Spain. Such a treaty had never existed; and it was merely the expression of his maj.'s inclination to forbear from hostilities against Spain, while she conducted herself within certain limits to which this term convention could have been applied by the Spanish court. Strange as it might appear, it seemed highly probable that the Spanish govt. had confounded this expression of a desire to forbear from hostilities on his maj.'s part to the nominal treaty of neutrality they about that time entered into with France, and chose to give the common name convention to both.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00847"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> said, he should urge nothing further on the subject at present; but on the face of it certainly it seemed to require a great deal of explanation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00848"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> observed, that it certainly seemed very extraordinary that Mr. Frere, who must have been aware of the full meaning of the word, should still have continued to make use of it so repeatedly. There was an ambiguity about this circumstance which he could not explain. The hon. gent, here read several passages from Mr. Frere's correspondence, in order to prove that Mr. Frere had used the term convention in a decided manner; particularly at the conclusion of Mr. Frere's note of the 30th Oct. he says, "he has
<image src="S1V0003P0I0092"/>
<col>155</col>
not hesitated to restore the period of the convention;" and in the answer of M. Cevallos, dated the 3d Nov. 1804, he states, "that Spain, in consequence of the neutrality, concluded the 19th Oct. 1803, will make no armament contrary to the said convention."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00849"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> maintained, that those expressions alluded solely to the treaty which Spain had entered into with France, and not to any engagements with this country.&#x2014;The motion was then put and agreed to.&#x2014;On the motion in which Mr. Grey wished to know the periods at which Adm. Cochrane's letters from Ferrol were received, the Chanc. of the Excheq. observed, that that point would be sufficiently ascertained on the production of other papers that has been moved for by the hon. gent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00850"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> then remarked, that the papers which had been ordered, would take up some time to prepare and print, before they could be presented to the house. As he did not think it likely that they would be in the possession of gent, in sufficient tithe before Thursday, to allow them to derive any benefit from the information they might contain, in the discussion that was fixed for that day, he was sure it would be a convenience to the house, to be informed, on what day it was the intention of the right hon. gent, that the discussion on the papers should take place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00851"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> replied, that it would undoubtedly be impossible that the papers then ordered should be printed and presented in time to afford any light on the discussion then standing for Thursday; and as it was desirable that every information should be communicated to the house previous to that discussion, in order to enable them to come to an impartial 'decision on the whole merits of the case, he was of opinion, that the question fixed for that day's discussion should be deferred to some subsequent open day. The right hon. gent, afterwards moved, that the papers presented, and to be presented to the house, relative to the Spanish war, be taken into consideration on Thursday se'n-night.

<p id="S1V0003P0-00852"><member>Lord Mulgrave</member><membercontribution> observed, that, having learned from the recent votes of the other house of parlt.
<col>156</col>
that certain documents, in addition to those already produced, were deemed essential to the due illustration of the question of hostilities with Spain; and as his anxious wish was to bring that important subject as fully to the consideration of parliament; and to the view of the public, as the case would admit of, he deemed it his duty to make farther inquiries upon the point, in order to learn what farther papers may be necessary. He doubted not he should have it in command from his maj. to produce the documents to which he alluded; they could not, however, be got ready or selected before Thursday, or perhaps before Friday, when it was probable he should have the honour of presenting them to their 1dps. In that view of the case, it was evidently impossible the discussion of the general question could be gone into on Thursday next, as proposed. He should, therefore, propose to discharge the order which at present stood for summoning their 1dps. upon that day, for the purpose of naming a subsequent day. In selecting this, another consideration was to be kept in view. Though he greatly wished to afford full time for the consideration of the documents in question, yet the consideration of having the case decided upon by parliament, with as little delay as its nature would admit, in order that the public mind may be set at rest upon the subject, operated with him very strongly. In that view, he should propose Thursday se'nnight as a proper day for taking the whole into consideration. He observed, that the papers which it was probable he should have occasion to produce, were not comparatively of the importance as those presented in the first instance. His 1dp. concluded, by moving that the order for summoning the lords on Thursday next be discharged,&#x2014;This communication, and its result, gave rise to a conversation of rather an irregular and desultory nature. On the question being put,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00853"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> shortly expressed his coincidence in the idea of its being proper that every information should be given relative to a subject of such importance as that in question, but that due time should be given for its full consideration. He was however sorry the day suggested by the noble lord had been selected; as he understood a noble friend of his had come down that day with the intent of giving notice of a motion on a subject of considerable importance on. Thursday se'nnight</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-00854"><member>Earl Darnley</member><membercontribution> said, it was his intention, to move to discharge the order for his motion on Monday next, with a view of proposing it for Thurdsday se'nnight. He wished at the same time to observe, that he did not intend to make any motion with respect to the general state of the army; to that task he did not think himself competent. He should merely confine himself to moving the repeal of the additional force act, which he still contended had operated as a tax, and had operated partially and unjustly. He concluded by moving to discharge the order for Monday.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00855"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> thought it would be better not to fix any day for the discussion of the question respecting the war with Spain until the additional papers were laid upon their 1dps table.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00856"><member>Lord Mulgrave</member><membercontribution> assured the house of his anxiety to have the subject fully before their 1dps., and to allow full time for its discussion; at the same time he must deprecate, with a reference to the great importance of the question, any proceedings which might interfere with its discussion on a day which might probably be proposed as convenient for that purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00857"><member>Lord Grenville,</member><membercontribution> in explanation, adverted to the competence of any noble lord to move for a summons of the house on any given day. He deemed the opposition which noble lords, over against him, seemed inclined to give to the intended motion of his noble friend, for summoning the house for Thursday se'nnight, as rather extraordinary, even under the circumstances of the case; the option, however, certainly rested with his noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00858"><member>The Earl of Carlisle</member><membercontribution> deemed the opposition which the noble lords in office seemed inclined to give to the discussion of his noble friend's intended motion on Thursday, as most extraordinary, even on their own grounds. They professed their anxious wishes to have the subject fully understood and considered: why not then appoint a later day? Friday, for instance. He saw no necessity whatever for positively fixing Thursday.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00859"><member>Earl Camden,</member><membercontribution> shortly adverted to the great importance of the Spanish question, on the grounds alleged by his noble friends on this bench with him; at the same time, he admitted it to be more regular and consonant to the orders and practice of the house, not to propose any particular day, until the papers were upon the table.</membercontribution></p>

verted to the anxious wish of his noble friend to have a subject of so great importance fully considered and discussed. He did not mean to say the proposition of the noble earl was not of considerable positive importance, but he thought, its discussion should not interfere with the decision of parliament, upon a topic of such peculiar importance as that previously submitted to its consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00861"><member>Lord Mulgrave</member><membercontribution> thanked his noble friend for adverting to his anxiety to have the subject alluded to fully considered and discussed; but he had forgotten his second consideration, which was one that equally operated upon his mind, namely, the propriety of having the question decided upon, with as little delay as the nature of the case would admit, in order, principally, that the public mind should be set at rest upon the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00862"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> observed, that he saw not the least necessity for selecting the day chosen by his noble friend, as that for the discussion of the Spanish question. By what fell from a noble secretary, it appeared, that the papers which remained to be produced were, comparatively, of no great importance; in that case, wiry should not an earlier day be fixed for the discussion? If the remaining papers were of importance, and necessary to the due understanding of the subject, ministers were deserving of censure for not bringing them forward in the first instance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00863"><member>Earl Darnley</member><membercontribution> then moved, that their 1dps. be summoned for Thursday se'nnight for the consideration of the repeal of the defeuce act. Ordered. &#x2014; Adjourned till Thursday.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[MIDDLESEX ELECTION.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00865"><member>Lord Marsham</member><membercontribution> moved, that the order of the day should be read for considering the report of the committee on the conduct of sir W Rawlins, knt. and R. Albion Cox, late sheriffs of the county of Middlesex, relative to their conduct at the election, in which W. Mainwaring, esq. and sir F. Burdett, bart. were the candidates for that county. After the order of the day was read, the clerk, on the motion of his 1dp. read the resolutions of the committee contained in the said report, and which were in effect as follows: "1. That it appears to this committee, that, on the 13th, 14th, and 15th days of the poll, on the first of which days there was a considerable majority of votes in favour of W. Mainwaring, esq. the sheriff, R. A. Cox, esq. and sir W. Rawlins, knt. wilfully, knowingly, and corruptly, did admit to poll for sir F. Burdett, bart. upwards of 300 persons, claiming to vote under a fictitious right as proprietors of a mill purported to be situate in the parish of Isleworth, and called the Good Intent Mill, by which means a colourable majority was obtained in favour of sir F. Burdett, who was thereby returned as having the greatest number of legal votes. 2. That it appeals to this committee, that, on the 15th day, towards the close of the poll, after such majority was established, they rejected persons tendering their votes under the same circumstances. 3d, That it appears to this committee, that the sheriff at the poll acted in a judicial capacity, by admitting counsel to argue the validity of votes, and by deciding in some instances on the validity of such votes; that in other instances they refused to decide on the validity of votes which were objected to, and stated, that
<col>160</col>
they would admit any persons to poll who would take the oaths, declaring themselves to be only ministerial officers, thereby acting in a manner contradictory to their practice in other cases, and in flagrant 'violation of their duty. 4. That it appears to this committee, that the obvious tendency of their conduct was, to admit persons having no right to poll, and to afford the greatest encouragement to perjury." &#x2014;The clerk then, on the motion of lord Marsham, read from the journals the proceedings in the New Shoreham case, in 1771; and that of Great Grimsby in 1803.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00866"><member>Lord Marsham</member><membercontribution> said, he proposed, in conformity with these precedents, to move four resolutions. 1st, That the charge should be heard at the bar. 2nd, That it should be heard on Friday, Feb. 1. 3d, That the sheriffs, sir W. Rawlins, and R. A. Cox, esq. be ordered to attend. 4th, That the said sir W. Rawlins, and R. A. Cox, esq. be furnished with a copy of the charge, and heard by counsel.&#x2014; The noble lord observed, that he proposed an early day for the discussion of this business, as it was desirable that a question of so much importance, which had stood over so long, should be determined as soon as possible; and also, as he understood, that it would be attended with no inconvenience to the parties concerned, but rather agreeable to their wishes to expedite the discussion. Agreeably to the precedents already referred to, the house would perceive that it was usual to move that evidence should be heard at the bar upon such an accusation; but to that part of the course of proceeding the noble lord did not think it at all necessary to adhere upon the present occasion, because the report on the table contained a very full account of all the evidence which related to the conduct of the sheriffs; that account was taken in short hand by a person sworn to report it with fidelity, the several witnesses were interrogated by the members of the committee, who were also on their oaths, and they underwent an ample cross-examination by counsel of the highest ability employed by the accused. The circumstances of the case were therefore already before the house, and there was no necessity for the further examination of any evidence on the subject. An objection, indeed, offered against the further production of evidence, from this consideration, that witnesses not being examined on oath at the bar of the house as
<image src="S1V0003P0I0095"/>
<col>161</col>
they were before the committee, might be induced to prevaricate. On the score of precedent it did not appear to him to follow that a motion for the further hearing of evidence should be made; for in one of the precedents that had been read to the house, the reason alleged to shew the propriety of such a motion was, that the party accused had no counsel present at the committee to cross-examine the witnesses upon whose testimony the accusation was grounded. This consideration could not be urged in the instance then before the house, nor did he conceive any ground upon which such a motion as he alluded to could be fairly sustained. The full investigation of every thing connected with the charge against, and the defence for the accused, which had taken place before the committee, of which he had the honour to be chairman, seemed to him entirely to preclude the necessity of any fresh examination of evidence. The case of a court martial, the minutes of the evidence taken before which formed the ground for the sentence, to be subsequently ratified by higher authority, he thought analogous to that of an election committee. To the committee it did not belong to pronounce any sentence, or to inflict any punishment. They had only to inquire into the subject referred to them, and to report their opinion thereon. Such was the course pursued by the committee whose report was under the consideration of the house, and that inquiry was so minute that he really could not think any farther inquiry by the examination of evidence necessary. Upon these grounds the noble lord said he would decline to make any motion of that nature.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00867"><member>The Speaker</member><membercontribution> called the attention of the house to the course of proceeding which the noble lord had announced his intention of adopting. In every part of that course the noble lord proposed to act consistently with the accustomed order of the house, with the exception of omitting to move for the production of evidence at the bar. This was a departure from the usage observed in the precedents which, according to the motion of the noble lord, had been read by the clerk; and also from that which had been attended to in another instance, since these precedents had occurred. From a just solicitude for the important privileges and order of the house, lie felt it his duty to notice the proposed deviation; at the same time he ob-
<col>162</col>
served that no question would arise upon it to-day. The practical question on this point, as to the sufficiency or deficiency of evidence, would occur when it should be proposed to proceed to a decision, without any farther examination of evidence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00868"><member>Mr. Francis</member><membercontribution> rose to ask, for information sake, for what purpose the business was at all brought before the house for consideration, if evidence was not to be examined; or upon what question the house was called on to decide? If the subject was not to be investigated at the bar the house would have nothing left to do but to adopt the opinion and recommendation of the committee; and there could be no use for the hearing of counsel. But he trusted this measure would be differently considered; for if the course proposed by the noble lord were followed, it did not appear to him that any question would remain for the discretion of the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00869"><member>Lord Marsham</member><membercontribution> stated, in reply to the hon. gent, that the question brought before the house for consideration was this., whether, from the whole body of evidence contained in the printed report on the table, and which comprehended the fullest information on both sides of the case, the committee was justified in the inference they made, and in the opinion they had pronounced upon the parties accused, and also whether any proceeding should be instituted grounded on such opinion. The noble lord repeated his objections to the farther examination of evidence.&#x2014;The resolutions were then put and carried.&#x2014;Adrjourned;</membercontribution></p>

The report was ordered to be received to-morrow.&#x2014;The house' also went into a committee on the pension office, personal estate, sugar, tobacco, and snuff duties bill, in which, pursuant to instruction, clauses of the same description were received as in the former.&#x2014;The report was ordered to be received to-morrow.&#x2014;Mr. Foster moved the order of the day for taking into consideration the message they had received on Monday last from the lords. Sir T. Featherstone and Mervyn Archdall being present, intimated that they were willing to go to the lords, with the leave of the house. It was therefore resolved, that sir T. Featherstone and Mervyn Archdall have leave to wait on the lords; and that a message be sent to their lordships, informing them of this resolution.&#x2014;On the motion of Mr. Rose, the house went into a committee on the quarantine act of the 39th and 40th of the king. Certain resolutions having been read and adopted, the house resumed, and leave was given to bring in a bill accordingly. &#x2014;Mr. Graham presented an account of the number of convicts on the river Thames and at Portsmouth which was laid on the table.&#x2014;Mr. Parr, from the African company, presented certain annual accounts relative to the affairs of that company.&#x2014; Mr. Kinnaird gave notice, that he should move, on Tuesday next, for a copy of the report of the navy board to the admiralty, dated the 24th Nov. 1804, respecting the state of the Romney, the Nassau, and the Sybille, when under the command of sir Home Popham. If the facts in the report should turn out to be agreeable to the information he had received, he should think it his duty to endeavour to induce the house to take some further proceedings in the investigation of this business. &#x2014;Mr. Giles, begged leave to call the attention of
<col>164</col>
the house to a subject of considerable importance. Two years had already elapsed since the board of commissioners of naval inquiry had been established under the authority of parliament. By the provisions of the bill, by which that board was constituted, its operation was limited to 2 years, from the 22d of Dec. 1802, and to the end of the next session of parliament. In consequence of the postponement of the meeting of parliament till after Christmas in the present session, that act would naturally determine with the present session, 12 months earlier than the period that was in the contemplation of parliament at the time of enacting it; for had the house met at the usual time, the date of the lapse of 2 years would have fallen within the present session, and of course the operation of the bill would he extended to the end of next session. His view in rising, therefore, was to ascertain from his maj.'s ministers, whether it was their intention to take any measures to prolong the duration of this beneficial act? Some minutes elapsed after Mr. Giles sat down, without any answer being given to his inquiry, upon which he rose again, observing, that from the silence of the gent. on the other side, he concluded that it was not in the contemplation of his maj.'s ministers to continue the bill. In that case he should feel it his duty to submit a motion to the house on the subject, which he fixed for Monday fortnight.&#x2014;Adjourned.</p>

<image src="S1V0003P0I0097"/>
<col>165</col>
be the reason for the noble lord's proposing, that the house should meet to-morrow, namely, that the additional papers relative to the question with Spain, were expected then to be ready to be laid upon the table. In stating that he did not mean to oppose the motion, he begged it to be understood, that he could not at all reconcile the conduct of the noble lord, and of his colleagues in office, in now wishing to push this matter to so early a discussion, to the effect even of taking precedence of another business, of which he (lord D.) had given notice, and which undoubtedly yielded in interest to none, with their previous proceedings and ideas on this subject. All the correspondence, all the papers at all connected with the Spanish question, were in their power and knowledge, and in the power and knowledge of none else. They ought at the beginning to have laid on the table every paper which was at all essential to the forming of a fair judgment on the question. They did lay such papers on the table, and noble lords on the same side of the house with himself made no objection to them, nor demanded any farther production. They were willing to have formed their judgment on the question, on the evidence which ministers themselves had thought sufficient. Now, however, ministers viewed the matter differently, and they had themselves moved for additional papers. To this his 1dp. said he could have no objection; but he must be forgiven for saying, that the conduct of noble lords on the other side, in his respect, did not correspond with that desire for a speedy discussion of the business which they had been so eager to profess: at all events, he could not see on what grounds their own delay, or want of preparation, ought to be esteemed a reason for postponing the motion on another important subject of which he had formerly given notice. He rather conceived the conduct of noble lords in administration, as a servile imitation of the proceedings in another house, which it was unbecoming the dignity of that house to follow, unless on most substantial and necessary grounds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00874"><member>Lord Mulgrave</member><membercontribution> expressed his surprise at some of the observations which fell from the noble earl. With respect, however, to the papers and documents in question, he would first say, that they were more voluminous than he had formerly occasion to apprehend, snaking a
<col>166</col>
quantity of not less than 70 printed pages. Every exertion was used to get the papers ready for presentation that day, but it was found impracticable; and it was wished the house should meet to-morrow, for the purpose of laying the papers on the table with the earliest possible opportunity. With respect to the blame which the noble earl seemed to impute to him, for his conduct on the occasion, he must say, he thought no blame could fairly be imputed to him, either for what he had done in the first instance, or in the subsequent proceedings. He had certainly, according to what he had professed, laid every information before the house, which he thought necessary, for the due understanding of the subject. He had professed his anxious wish to have the subject fully and completely before parliament and the public, and on that principle he acted. The idea of producing additional information, it should be recollected, did not originate with him; it was deemed, upon maturer consideration of the topics, to be necessary by other persons, and in other quarters. In conformity, therefore, with the wish to have every degree of information which might be deemed necessary before parliament and the public, it was, that he had proposed the production of the additional documents; and this with as little delay as possible: in which view, and with reference to an early discussion of, and decision upon, the subject, it was proposed to meet to-morrow. Such an attack upon ministers as that proceeding from the noble earl, he had never yet heard of. He had heard of attacks upon ministers, for withholding due information in the first instance, and pertinaciously refusing it afterwards; but never, till that day, did he hear them blamed for wishing to give every possible information upon a. subject. He had heard of attacks upon ministers, for wishing to urge a premature discussion of particular topics; but never, till then, did he hear any ministers arraigned for postponing the day, in order to afford a full and ample interval for deliberation. With respect to the noble earl's idea, that a wish existed with his maj.'s present ministers, to induce a servile imitation, on the part of that house, of the proceedings of the other house of parliament, it was entirely unfounded, Did such a desire manifest itself in an obvious wish to give their lordships as full and complete information upon the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0098"/>
<col>167</col>
subject in question, as that which was proposed to be given to the other house? Did a line of proceeding, obviously intended to enable that house to discuss and decide upon the subject, on at least as early a day as the other house, argue a wish to make their lordships the servile imitators and followers of that house? Certainly not. So much for the assertion of the noble earl on that head, and the wish to meet to-morrow being in strict conformity to every principle laid down by his majesty's ministers in that house for their conduct; with respect to the subject in question, he did not see how any noble lord could consistently object to the proceeding.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00875"><member>Earl Darnley</member><membercontribution> said, he did not, nor could he ever have intended to complain, that too much information had been afforded. He would say, however, that it was the duty of ministers to have known what papers were requisite for the discussion of the question; and that they should have come prepared with them in the first instance.&#x2014;Adjowned.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-00878"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> rose, not he said to object to the day proposed, but to state, in a few words, his own opinion as to the mode of proceeding suggested by the noble lord. The noble lord had said it was not the intention to examine any witnesses at the bar on this subject: but he trusted, whenever that house was called on to exercise a jurisdiction, a criminal jurisdiction too, that it would found its decisions on evidence which it had itself heard, and not merely upon the evidence heard by others elsewhere. If, indeed, as he understood, from the noble lord's intimation, the late sheriffs had no objection to admit the evidence before a committee against them, certainly there could be no objection, on the part of the house, to accept that evidence as part of the grounds for its own decisions. But not calling evidence as to any thing already proved before a committee, and calling no evidence to their exculpation now, were, in his own mind, two very distinct considerations. He was decidedly of opinion, that if any matters had come to their knowledge for their own exculpation, even since the decision of the committee, it would be perfectly open for them to bring forward such evidence.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00879"><member>Lord Marsham</member><membercontribution> answered, that when he
<image src="S1V0003P0I0099"/>
<col>169</col>
last mentioned this business to the house, he supposed it to be the intention of the sheriffs to examine witnesses, in their exculpation, at the bar: but having had an interview with their counsel since, he understood it to be their determination not to examine any witnesses at all. The object of his motion to-night, therefore, was to give those gent. full time to make up their minds as to the nature of their ultimate defence, that they might have no cause whatever to complain of being taken by surprise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00880"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> rose, hot to make any objection to the noble lord's motion, nor to delay the house now by any argument upon the subject itself. He rose merely to express his sentiments in the first instance, respecting a principle avowed by the hon. gent, ever against him (Mr. Fox), namely, that the house, when called on to exercise its jurisdiction on this subject, should not be satisfied with the evidence taken elsewhere, but should examine evidence for its own satisfaction. Against such a principle he begged to protest, in the first instance, as contrary to the established usage of parliament, always before, and ever since the passing of Mr. Grenville's act in the year 1770: Previously to that time, it was the constant usage of the house, in deciding upon matters respecting contested elections, to form its judgment upon evidence taken before its' committees, and not to examine evidence to the same points at its bar. The Grenville act created the first alteration in the law and usage of parliament upon this head; and it must be recollected, that a. principal alteration made by that act was, that the committees for investigating such questions must be chosen by ballot, must examine all evidence on oath, and must themselves be sworn to act and decide justly, to the best of their opinion. The house then surely, would not be less inclined to accept the evidence taken before a committee so solemnly bound, now, than they would be to accept evidence before a committee not so bound, previously to the passing of the Grenville act. The precedents only in which the house did act in any degree at all different from this principle, were the Shoreham case, the Liskeard, and the Great Grimsby. In the Cricklade case some such proceeding was proposed, and the house adjourned the consideration of that case from time to time, in order to
<col>170</col>
search for precedents, but came to no final decision. His motive for troubling the house at all, on the present occasion, was au earnest wish to uphold the character and privileges of parliament, and to guard against any innovation which, might tend to alter its established forms of proceeding, or diminish those powers it had always enjoyed and exercised. He had no objection to concur in a motion, having for its object to give those gent. further time till Tuesday, to make up their minds; but his object was not so much the accommodation of individuals, as to maintain the privileges of the house itself.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00881"><member>Mr. Francis</member><membercontribution> thought, that evidence, ought, in every judicial proceeding, to be heard before the judges. This would be a great satisfaction to the house; and be was at present inclined to think that gent, could not, in honour and justice, decide upon a penal case without hearing evidence at the bar. He hoped, therefore, that before Tuesday, the house would deeply reflect upon a question which, independent of the present case, was in itself of so much importance.&#x2014;The order, of the day was then postponed till Tuesday next.</membercontribution></p>

<title>FIRST ADDITIONAL PAPERS RELATIVE TO THE DISCUSSION WITH SPAIN IN 1803 and 1804, PRESENTED BY HIS MAJESTY'S' COMMAND TO BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, 2d FEBRUARY 1805 (see p. 61.)</title>

Hawkesbury, dated Madrid,</i> 10th <i>June</i> 1803,<i>recd.</i>3lst <i>July.</i>&#x2014;It is possible that the inclosed intelligence may have already reached you through lord R. Fitzgerald. On questioning the prince of peace, he declared that the king had made repeated instances to be informed of the assemblage of such a body of troops, but that no explanation had been obtained. This certainly does not appear very probable; but it is a fact, that this govt, are treated with great neglect on the subject of Portugal, and are kept in the dark as to the object of the correspondence which has been passing with such activity between generals Bournonville and Lannes. M. Cevallos, when I mentioned to him the intelligence which I had received, said that he had received the same, but that later intelligence had persuaded him that the assemblage would not be so great or so immediate; and I yesterday received a report agreeing with this latter opinion.</p>

30th May. I have already mentioned to you the arrival of some troops at this place; two other brigades are expected the 13 Floreal, (2d June), the 77th and the 24th. There will be, independently of the two divisions of 25,000 men each, intended for the conquest of Portugal, a body of reserve of 12,000. The camp is already marked out at Bidard, (a league and a half from hence). I believe I have already told you that one of these divisions will march by Perpignan, and the other by Bayonne:, 37,000. men are therefore expected here; but as I have just said, the 12,000 of reserve only will remain. The army will afterwards march into Spain. The command of it is provisionally given to gen, Cara St. Cyr, a relation, I fancy, of him who was ambassador at Madrid. Gen. La Marque is intrusted with the organization of these troops.&#x2014;8th June. There is for the present nothing new, or at least very, interesting. The arrival of some battalions, and of a regiment of Chasseurs cavalry; the 24th, that which in the last war served the campaign of Portugal; they are tolerably well mounted, but badly equipped, or rather badly clothed; We are now assured, that the army which is coming here will not exceed 5 or 6,000 men, although it is 'still reported that it will be augmented to 40,000. I believe it, for I do not see that the govt, has so large a disposable force.</p>

Hawkesbury, dated Madrid, 6th July</i> 1803, <i>reed.</i> 3<i>d Aug,</i>&#x2014;I have to acknowledge the receipt of your Idp.'s dispatch of the 2d ult, and I have great satisfaction in reflecting that the last which your ldp. will have received from me will shew that I have been fortunate enough to conform my conduct to the general spirit and tendency of the instructions which your Idp. had laid down for my guidance. The present state of things is one which it is not very easy to define. The prince of peace has not yet thought proper to commit himself by any distinct proposals upon the subject of obtaining a guarantee for that neutrality which this country professes itself to have adopted; at the same time there is an evident increase in the ill humour of the French ambassador, and some serious altercations have passed between him and the prince of peace, Upon my making some enquiries upon the subject of the French rassemblement at Bayonne, upon which, he had before demanded an explanation of the French ambassa-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0101"/>
<col>173</col>
dor, as mentioned in my letter of the 10th ult. he told me that he at last declared to him that if an army was collected there; he should establish a superior force in camp opposite to them. Some few days since gen. Bournonville declared that the French army was dispersed into cantonments, and the orders for joining it countermanded, and insisted against the establishment of a Spanish camp. The prince of peace, however, told him that it could still be adhered to as a measure of precaution, he has said likewise that if the French attempted to force a passage he would raise an army, and that the king would put himself at the head of it to oppose them. When I last called upon him, after the receipt of your ldp.'s dispatch, I told him, that though I had already explained to him the intentions of his maj. respecting Portugal, yet that I had received such positive instructions from your ldp. upon the subject, that I could not forbear repeating the same declaration in a more formal manner. To this he answered, that he believed that the differences between France and Portugal were in a train of being settled, but that this country would still continue its preparations, and that he had given orders for 12 regiments of militia to be assembled, to form part of a camp in Castile.&#x2014;It should seem singular, and even suspicious, that while language of this kind is passing, no positive declaration should be made to G. Brit, nor any distinct statement made of the means which might be necessary, and which they might expect G. Brit, to contribute in vindication of their neutrality, if attempted to be violated. It is, however, remarkable, that many Spaniards with whom I have conversed, and who were ardently desirous of an alliance against France, have never seemed to look for any assistance from England beyond her co-operation; and the various symptoms of ill-humour on the part of the French minister are evidently real and unaffected; at the same time the attentions of their majesties are marked to the Portuguese minister, and myself, in a manner which has excited general observation.&#x2014;The king has been much irritated, in addition to the former provocations from France, by the violence which has been offered to the independence and neutrality of Tuscany; and both their majesties have been sincerely and deeply affected by the death of the king of Etruria.&#x2014;The disposition of the people has been always favourable to England, and bas been
<col>174</col>
much more so of late; and even among those classes whose politics are not so spirited or so generous as those of the mob, there is a great disposition to take part decidedly with us, and this is only checked by the apprehension of our being perfectly cut off from continental alliances, and that therefore the whole brunt of the war would fall on Spain. The common people are persuaded that there is a secret understanding with England, and that when Spain is completely armed, the two powers are to fall jointly upon France; they add several particulars of the supposed treaty, and are universally delighted with the prospect.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00887">No. 3.&#x2014;<i>Extract of a Dispatch from J. H. Frerc, Esq. to Ld. Hawkesbury, dated Madrid, 7th July</i> 1803, <i>recd.</i> 3d Aug&#x2014;Before I had finished the preceding dispatch, I was called away to the usual audience which M. Cevallos gives to foreign ministers on Wednesday night. I then learned that intelligence had arrived of his maj.'s govt, having accepted the mediation of the emperor of Russia. M. Cevallos communicated the intelligence to me. He expressed his wish for general tranquillity; that it was above all things his maj.'s desire to preserve a good understanding and harmony with England; that war was no advantage to any power, though it might serve to enrich our sailors; that commerce was the true interest of the two nations. I replied, that the sentiments of England were the same; and that his maj.'s govt, had given a fair proof of them in abstaining from the detention of the Spanish vessels at a moment so critical as that of the arrival of all their specie, and under circumstances which would have perfectly justified such a measure; but that his maj. wished rather to trust to the honour and generous feelings of his Cath. maj. persuaded that whatever appeared ambiguous or doubtful, was the effect of circumstances, and not of any unfriendly inclination. He answered with more feeling and openness than I expected, that his Cath. maj. was fully sensible of the confidence and generosity of his maj. and desirous of cultivating the best understanding with his govt.&#x2014;Upon the whole, considering the disposition at present existing here, I cannot but consider it as extremely favourable, at the same time that it will require great attention and management to maintain it for any length of time upon its present footing.&#x2014;It is to be considered that a degree of irritation equal to what exists at present has existed on
<image src="S1V0003P0I0102"/>
<col>175</col>
former occasions, but has as often subsided; and the govt, for want of encouragement or opportunity, and the absence of immediate provocation have again relapsed to their old habit of acquiescence. The degree of provocation which has been given in the present instance, and accumulated in so short a space of time as the affair of Louisiana, Etruria, and Naples, is not likely to recur again. The feeling of resentment against France; therefore, will probably grow weaker, and the present disposition be materially altered, unless it is kept up tin the part of England by marked and particular attention to this court and its minister.</p>

Hawkesbury, dated Madrid,</i> 21st <i>July</i> 1803, recd, 28th <i>Aug.</i>&#x2014;My Lord; I take advantage of a private conveyance, to inform your ldp. of the little Which has occurred since the date of my last. In an interview which I had some few days ago with the prince of peace, I returned to the subject of the situation in which this country stood. He told me that it was his Cath. maj.'s intention to offer his mediation, and that the offer would be made in the form of a letter to his maj. I answered with expressions of great respect for the mediation of this court, and satisfaction at the form in which it was intended to be proposed; but suggested the propriety of departing from their usual system of gaining time, and endeavouring, on the contrary, to hasten this step, so that it might be connected with the mediation of Russia. I did not, however, find him disposed to agree with me in my opinion upon this point; on the contrary, he said, that the chief object of this measure was to gain time.&#x2014;I ought to mention to your ldp. a circumstance which I cannot well account for. The prince of peace has repeatedly; declared, that though some overtures have been made by the French govt, upon the subject of the contingent, yet that no distinct demand has been made.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00889">No. 5.&#x2014;<i>Extract of a Dispatch from J. M. Frere, Esq. to Ld. Hawkesbury, dated Madrid,</i> 5th <i>Aug.</i> 1803, <i>recd.</i> 12th <i>Sep.</i>&#x2014;I take advantage of a courier whom Mr. Frere is now dispatching, to inform your ldp. of the subject of a very important conversation which I had this morning with the Prince of Peace; and which amounted in substance to a declaration, that the demands and menaces of France had become so urgent, as to leave them no alternative
<col>176</col>
between immediate compliance and a declaration of war. He endeavoured to shew me that they had made every proposition which could be thought of, to avert such an extremity; that they had even proposed to estimate the full expenee of the contingent which was demanded of them by France, and to pay it to that govt, as the price of their neutrality. This had been refused, and a demand made in return, of 24 millions per month. To this outrageous proposal an answer has been returned, that, all things considered, it would be more practicable and less ruinous to abide by the terms of the treaty, and to furnish the contingent. He then applied himself to prove to me, that if they were forced to a measure of this kind, and to a nominal declaration of war against G. Brit. it ought not to make any difference in the relations between the two countries, or in the good understanding between them. To this I answered, that I was sorry I could not give the kind of answer which he might expect; that it was my duty to be frank with him; and that, without giving any opinion of my own on the propriety of continuing the system of forbearance, which in the two last wars had been used with respect to Spain, it was not in my power to flatter him with a prospect of its continuance: that as nothing had been gained by so long a perseverance in this system, it was natural to expect that it would be renounced by G. Brit.&#x2014;Having your ldp.'s last instructions upon the subject of the contingent present to my mind, I did not enter further into the discussion, though I was persuaded that what I did venture to say produced a strong impression, and will incline the prince to use every possible endeavour, as he assured me that he would do, to divert the French govt, from the pursuit of their present demands.</p>

Hawkesbury, dated Madrid,</i> 15<i>th Aug.</i> 1503. <i>recd.</i> 20<i>th Sep.</i>&#x2014;I take advantage of the passage of a courier from M. Souza at Paris, whom Mr. Frere has detained for a few hours. Two days after the date of my last I called upon the prince of peace, in order to take leave of him before he set off for St. Ildefonso. I found him in a temper and toner so different from that of our last conference, that I ventured to ask him what could have passed to have made such jut. alteration in so short an interval? He
<image src="S1V0003P0I0103"/>
<col>177</col>
said that the day before he had had al long conversation with the French ambassador, and that he had spoken to him in a tone which had had its weight. It is certain that this conference had been a very long and a very warm one; and the ambassador came away with evident marks of discontent and ill humour. It is certain that, since this conversation and the arrival of some couriers who were supposed to bring very important dispatches, he has very much changed his tone, and has even said to several persons, who he intended should repeat his conversation to me, that he was sorry that the English minister appeared to give himself so much uneasiness; that in fact there was no ground for it; and that there was not any disposition on the part of France to make Spain a party in the war.&#x2014;The present report which I have not the means to verify before the departure of the courier, but which comes to me from good authority, is, that the French govt, have successively reduced their demand to 100 million of rials, or 1 million sterling, and since to 72 million; and that the present offer of the Spanish govt, is 60 million; or &#x00A3; 600,000 to be paid as an annual subsidy in lieu of their contingent.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00891">No. 7.&#x2014;<i>Extract of a Dispatch from J. H. Frere, Esq. to Ld. Hawkesbury, dated Escurial,</i> 9th <i>Oct.</i> 1803, <i>recd.</i> 9th <i>Nov.</i>&#x2014;I have to announce to your Idp. the conclusion of the negotiation between this country and France, agreeably to the conjecture which I stated in my last report to your ldp. upon the subject; namely, that for the present moment, the difference would be patched up with money; and that it can only be for the present moment. Your ldp. will easily conceive from the exorbitance of the sum, which is no less than 6 millions of lives a month; a sacrifice beyond the ability of Spain to furnish, and, as I have distinctly explained to the prince of peace, far exceeding the limits of any thing but a mere temporary connivance on the part of England.&#x2014;On the 3d inst. M. Herman arrived from Paris, and the same evening had a conference with the prince of peace at this Sitio. The next day, there was a second conference; at which M. Cevallos was present. And on the following day, the prince of peace sent to acquaint me that every thing was settled; that they had made every sacrifice to preserve their neutrality; and that they had finally consented to pay 6' millions of livres a month.
<col>178</col>
&#x2014;The terms, it seems, which M. Herman had been instructed to' demand, included the payment of arrears pretended to be due since the beginning of the war, at this same rate, together with a payment in advance, the amount of which I could not learn. The result of these conferences was, to reduce them simply to the monthly payment of 6 millions of livres. Upon M. Herman's return to Madrid, Gen. Bournonville set off himself for Sitio. He had two successive conferences with the prince of peace; which terminated in obtaining some further addition to the terms which, had been extorted by M. Herman, the exact nature of which I have not yet been able to learn. When I pressed the prince of peace upon the subject of the treaty, he said that there was nothing but an additional article about the transit of French woollens to Portugal. I then asked what security was obtained for that country; he said that was settled; Portugal was to pay a million of livres a month; that the demand upon Spain was extravagant in comparison; and that had been made so, he believed, with a view of a future ground ofquarre1,. in case they should find themselves unable to fulfil the engagements which they had been forced to enter into. He said, however, that orders had been sent to M. Azara to sign a treaty; and that they should think no price too great for the maintenance of their neutrality; and he added something which implied a presumption that such a neutrality might continue through the war. I interrupted, and reminded him of what I had said on a former occasion on the same subject, that I thought it possible that G. Brit, might connive at a trifling sacrifice, such as that which was exacted from Portugal, or even at the present, if considered merely as a temporary measure, and intended to give time till the disposition of the great powers of Europe should be more decidedly known, and till those powers themselves should be acquainted with the circumstances and situation of this country. He asked, How was it possible for Spain to act otherwise? That their conduct was the effect of their weakness, and not of any real hostility to England. I admitted it; but added, that the effects were the same: that a subsidy, such as they were about to grant, was a much greater injury to the interests of England than any that could be apprehended from their hostility. He admitted this; but pleaded the utter impossibility
<image src="S1V0003P0I0104"/>
<col>179</col>
of resistance, and the necessity of submitting so demands which were backed by such a force. I said, that I hoped that these considerations would induce England to forbear for a time, and that I would most earnestly recommend it to him to look to something beyond the present, which could serve as nothing but a tempory expedient.</p>

Your ldp. may rest assured that the compliance of the Spanish govt, is the effect of fear and constraint; and that fear is nothing less than the apprehension, by no means an exaggerated one, of seeing a French army at Madrid, before there could be any possibility of their receiving support or assistance from abroad. Under these circumstances, and knowing the character of this govt, it will not appear extraordinary to your ldp. that they should have preferred a remote danger to one which was pressing and immediate. At the same time I can venture to say, that there never was a time in which the Brit. govt, or the Brit, nation were more popular here; not only with the country in general, but with the court, with the person in power, and with the royal family; and it is but doing them justice to say, that the liberality and generosity of his maj.'s conduct has been felt in the manner it ought; while, on the other hand, the disgust which, has been created by the brutrality and insolence of the French, has risen to such a pitch as to break through all disguise.</p>

that our conference must be as short as possible; that he had only, to tell me, that he had not yet signed any thing, and that most probably he should not; but that all depended upon the disposition of Portugal, and upon the answer which he might get from Mr. Frere when he should see him the next day. I asked him what the additional terms were? He answered that they were wholly inadmissible; that they demanded, "l'eloignement des troupes et le passage." I said, the passage through Spain to Portugal? he answered, "le passage partout&#x2014;enlin la dispersion de nos troupes&#x2014;dans nos ports&#x2014;partout."&#x2014;I reminded him of the declaration which the Portuguese govt, had given, that they considered the Pyreneans as the common frontier which protected the two countries; and I assured him that England would not suffer Portugal to shrink from this declaration in a case like this, which undoubtedly involved the two countries in a common danger.</p>

The troops still remain in Gallicia, but all idea of their being destined to foreign service seems now at an end.&#x2014;The American minister has received a note, in which the claim of his govt, to Louisiana is formally recognized.

Ferrol, consisting, at the lowest estimation, of about 6,000 men.&#x2014;Though it is not evident that they have any immediate object of hostility in view, yet, in the present situation of the two countries, I should consider myself as wholly inexcusable if I were to connive at the execution of a measure of such an important, and, under all its circumstances, of so suspicious a nature. I must therefore recommend it to you as an object (as it appears to me) of the utmost consequence to his maj,'s service, that the sailing

In the mean time however, and unless you should yourself receive instructions to the contrary, I beg to be considered as charging myself with any responsibility which may attach to the measure which I recommend.&#x2014;As it is my wish to avoid any needless appearance of menace, I would advise the utmost secrecy upon the subject of this letter.

Hawkesbury, dated Madrid, 5th Mar l804; recd, the 29th.&#x2014;A conversation which I had this morning with the prince of peace, has so much confirmed me in the opinion which I have already stated to your ldp. that I cannot avoid mentioning some particulars of it. It seems the French had sent to demand the payment of an instalment of their subsidy, which I suppose impressed the subject more strongly on his mind. After a good deal of other conversation, he complained of the uncertainty in which they were kept with respect to the intentions of England; that their trade was ruined; that the merchants dared not make any expeditions; and he concluded by dwelling on the general embarrassment created by their present uncertainty of bringing home their money from America, and the scarcity and distress throughout the country. I said that I had already mentioned to him the necessary preliminary to any understanding upon this head, namely, the communication of the treaty. He repeated the same objection which he had made use of before, and which is mentioned in a former letter to your ldp. and when I remarked upon the unreasonableness of expecting that G. Brit, should give her assent lo an unknown agreement, he said that it was a subject in which he bad nothing to do, and which belonged to the secretary of state. I shall accordingly make it the object of a conference with M. Cevallos, and intend going to Aranjuez for that purpose.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00901">No. 15.&#x2014;<i>Translation of a letter from the Chev. d'Anduaga to Ld. Hawekesbury, dated Portland Place,</i> 9<i>th March,</i> 1804,&#x2014;My lord; Having received from my court, by the last packet from Lisbon, some interesting dispatches, I wished to converse with your excl. on the subject of them; but Mr. Hammond having given me to understand how extremely occupied your excl. is at present, I have thought, that, to
<col>184</col>
give your excl. the least possible trouble, and at the same time not to neglect the execution of the orders which had been sent to me, I should do better, and it would even be more agreeable to your excl. to give you without delay, and confidentially, some idea of the object of the audience which I had requested of your exl. through Mr. Hammond. The perfect confidence, with which your ldp. has inspired me, leads me to communicate to you, without reserve, every thing which can in any wise contribute to convince your excl as well as the British ministry, of the amicable intentions, and of the pacific sentiments of my court.&#x2014;You will recollect, my lord, that whenever I have had the honour to converse with your excl. on the principles on which the English govt, might consent to the neutrality of Spain in the present war, even though she furnished to France those succours in troops and vessels stipulated by the treaty of 1796, as well as on the means by which it might be accomplished, I earnestly requested the Brit, ministry maturely to consider this affair, before they took a decisive resolution; since, exclusive of the reasons which I then alleged in support of the system which I proposed, it never would happen that Spain would furnish, either a single vessel, or a single soldier, against England; since, according to accurate intelligence, the Spanish govt, would then have already entered upon a negotiation with France to substitute money in the place of the succours in troops and vessels; and that this substitution being reciprocally advantageous to both countries, it could not but be effected without difficulty. I considered myself as so much the more authorized to speak with such confidence, as I supposed England perfectly agreed with us on this point; since in none of our conversations, in which your excl. constantly testified to me an opposition to the furnishing by Spain of succours in kind, and principally in ships, did you ever make any mention of pecuniary succours. It was in consequence of this persuasion, to which I myself contributed, that Spain determined to make that sacrifice of money, which she has made by her last treaty with France, flattering herself that she would by this means insure to herself the friendship of England; else, how would it be possible that Spain would have signed a treaty of this nature, if it was not in order the better to obtain the accomplishment of her pacific wishes with respect to England?
<image src="S1V0003P0I0107"/>
<col>185</col>
Can it be imagined, that Spain would be induced to make sacrifices in order to avoid a war, and that at the same time she would have reason to fear, that these very sacrifices would be a subject of discontent for the British ministry?&#x2014;The Brit. govt, not having therefore taken it amiss, that Spain should furnish money instead of the troops and ships stipulated by the treaty of 1796, cannot moreover complain, if the sums to be paid by Spain be proportioned to the expences which she must have been at for. the maintenance of the above-mentioned ships and troops: it would even be inconsequent to refuse the 2d condition, after having tacitly acquiesced in the 1st. In the event even of Spain having promised to France something more than an equivalent, it would not be the fault of my court. All the world well knows, that she would not in that case have done more, than submit to the necessity of circumstances; for, from the very moment that England opposed itself to the furnishing by Spain of succours in kind, there remained for her no other course to take, than that of concerting with her ally the amount to be fixed upon as the equivalent.&#x2014;Although there is no reason to believe, that the French govt, has exacted from my court more than an equivalent to the stipulated succours; it is nevertheless painful to recal at this moment to your excl. one of the observations which I made during the negotiation, in order to induce the Brit, ministry to recognize the neutrality of Spain, even though she should furish the succours in kind; namely, that if England had adhered to it, she would have obtained two great advantages: 1st. That of performing a striking action of justice and of policy, an action conformable to the law of nations, and likely to gain over to her the suffrages of all Europe: 2d. That of depriving France of all means of increasing her claims on Spain, in case she should wish so to do.&#x2014;If the treaty of pecuniary subsidies lately concluded between Spain and France deserves every attention on the part of the Brit. govt, when examined with respect to the pacific views which were the motive of the former of these powers for concluding it, and to the circumstances which preceded and accompanied its conclusion, it is not the less an object of forbearance and of approbation for England, if regard is had to the saving which it procured to that power of an augmentation of naval forces, which she would have been
<col>186</col>
forced to make, to oppose to the vessels which Spain would have furnished to France, supposing that the treaty of pecuniary subsidies had not been concluded.&#x2014;To this advantage must be added another, which is not of less importance to England; it is, that as long as Spain shall pay the pecuniary subsidies lately stipulated, the French govt, cannot engage its ally in any step contrary to the laws of the strictest neutrality; and that, with this security, England may concentrate its military operations in the employment of all its land and sea forces.&#x2014;The facts and the reflections which I have now laid before your excl. prove, 1st. The sincerity with which Spain has desired, and still desires, to maintain be friendship with England; 2d. That her conduct has been in perfect conformity with these desires; 3d. That in her last treaty with the French govt, she has sought to conciliate her relations of friendship with England, and her duties towards France: in short, that England reaps real advantages from the said treaty of subsidies.&#x2014;From all that I have now stated, there cannot remain a doubt, that the court of Spain, as well from the good faith which it has manifested in all its proceedings during the negotiation, as from the reiterated proofs which it has constantly given to the Brit. govt, of its sincere desire to continue its relations of friendship with them, has an incontestible right to the most perfect reciprocity on the part of England, of whose sentiments I have never entertained the least doubt, particularly since the conferences which I had with your excl. on the 21st and 26th of Jan. last.&#x2014;In these conferences, on the subject of which I have infinite satisfaction in reflecting, your excl. manifested the most just and most valuable sentiments with regard to Spain, they discovered to me, how fully sensible his Brit, maj.'s govt, were of the situation of my court with respect to France at the moment of the conclusion of its treaty with her; and that, entering into all the considerations which could have. induced Spain to agree to any thing which might displease England, they would be ready to give way to them, provided that Spain acted frankly with the English govt, and that she manifested in the rest of her conduct that good faith which is consonant to a friendly power, who observes a neutrality towards belligerent powers. This declaration, which I hastened to transmit to my court by the same messenger which your excl dispatched
<image src="S1V0003P0I0108"/>
<col>187</col>
the very day in which the first conference was held, must necessarily have met with the most favourable reception at Madrid. It will even have dissipated the doubts and fears to which Mr. Frere's note of the 13th of Dec. (on the meaning of which, the Spanish ministry requested Mr. Frere to demand explanations of his govt.) had given rise. But as, during this interval, Mr. Frere delivered a 2d note, in which the Spanish ministry could not yet discover what might be the intention of England in the last step which Mr. Frere had taken they have thought it indispensable, to order me to request the English ministry to explain themselves in a frank and precise manner as to their intentions towards Spain. Now, since it is important that, in an affair which so deeply interests both govts, and on the principle of which having always agreed, they have mutually invited each other to explanations, they should hasten to communicate their respective wishes, I think that it will be-very advantageous to both courts, that I should converse with your excl. on some points, which may facilitate the accomplishment of these wishes. It is for this reason, my lord, that I take the liberty to request of you a conference. I flatter myself, that your excl. will grant it to me as soon as possible, particularly, as, from the instructions which I have received from my court, the result cannot but be very favourable.&#x2014;I avail myself, &amp;c.

They afford the fullest confirmation of every thing which I have had the honour to state to your excl. in all our conversations, and especially in those of the 21st and 26th Jan. respecting the sentiments and conduct of the king, my master, towards his Brit, maj. I will not here repeat the answer which his excl. M Cevallos gave to Mr. Frere, on the 27th Feb. with regard to the complaints brought forward in his 3 notes of the 23d and 24th of the same month. This answer, as well from its simplicity and the force of its reasoning, as from its conciliating spirit, and the most positive assurances of the king's uprightness in all his proceedings, the sincerity of which is
<col>188</col>
supported by well-known facts, cannot leave on the British govt, the least doubt as to the conduct of Spain in the neutrality which she has adopted with regard to the belligerent powers. I suppose, my lord, that this answer will have reached you, and I refer you entirely to it.&#x2014;But as I never lost any opportunity of informing my court of every thing which could contribute to accelerate a perfect understanding between the two govts, relative to the neutrality of Spain, and especially of the fears manifested by the British govt. lest any thing to the prejudice of England would have been stipulated in the treaty of neutrality concluded with France, I hasten, my lord, to communicate to your excl. what the chev. de Cevallos informed me in this respect on the 4th March last. "In the treaty of neutrality with France," says he, "we have not admitted any art prejudicial to England; and we have rejected some which appeared foreign to a treaty of subsidy. In order to fix the amount of these, regard has been had to the expence which the succours in kind,' such as are stipulated in our treaty of alliance with France, would have cost us. One part even of these subsidies is retained for the payment of the sums owed us by this power. We have, without violating our neutrality, afforded to the English all the succours of which their vessels have been in need. Our conduct towards the French has also been governed by the same principles. The notes transmitted to his Brit, maj.'s minister, resident at this court, breathe nothing but candour, good faith, and the desire to preserve the strictest neutrality. The most recent proof of this is the note which I transmitted to him on the 29th Feb. last, in answer to several complaints which he had addressed to me, and of which I send your excl. a literal copy, to enable you to make use of it to lord Hawkesbury. You will there observe, that Mr. Frere makes no return to our candour, and to our overture; since at the very time he protests that his govt, entertains the most ardent desires to keep up a good understanding with Spain, he throws out propositions capable of alarming us, and of clogging our commerce, although we have demanded of him clear and definite explanations. In short, I can assure your excl. that nothing relative to commerce has been stipulated in the treaty of subsidy."&#x2014;I flatter myself, my lord in previously making you this

With this I am made acquainted by the chev. de Cevallos, in his dispatch of the 1st April, who adds, "that in order not to leave the Brit: ministry the least room for doubt on the real system of our court, his maj. had acceded to the conditions which Mr. Frere had demanded, as necessary for insuring the acknowledgment and observance of our neutrality on the part of England." The chev. du Cevallos at the same time transmitted to me a copy of the answer which he returned to Mr. Frere's note of the 15th Feb. last, and I have the honour to send you a literal translation of it, by which your excl. cannot fail to be convinced of the sincerity of all my communications, and of the constant dispositions of my court to strengthen, and increase the relations of friendship which subsist between the two govts.&#x2014;I avail myself, &amp;c.

<p id="S1V0003P0-00906">The subsidy paid by this country to France had been regularly acquitted up to the month of May, at the rate of 800,000 dollars per month. A new expedient has since been hit upon for enabling the French govt, to avail itself of the resources of Spain to an extent which will not be limited by those difficulties which must sooner or later have put as top to the extraction of specie. A loan of 5 millions of dollars has been negotiated at Paris in favor of this govt, or, more properly speaking, in favor of that of France, as it is not to be imagined that any part of it will ever find its way into this country, or be applied to any other purpose than that of the payment of the stipulated tribute. It is agreed that the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0110"/>
<col>191</col>
capital is to be repaid at the end of 3 years; the annual interest to be 6 per cent, with an allowance of 3 per cent, for commission upon the whole capital subscribed; there is besides a farther advantage allowed to the contractors, namely, a privilege of exporting, free of duty, a quantity of dollars, to the amount of the capital subscribed: this cannot be calculated at less than 6 per cent. and may be much more. These sums, therefore, divided amongst the 3 years, make at least an additional 3 per cent, and give 9 per cent, as the lowest rate of annual interest paid by this govt, for an exigible debt. It may, I should imagine, be safely reckoned as only a little short of 10 per cent, or nearly the rate of interest upon the vales, which bear 6 per cent, and are at a discount of 36.</p>

My lord; After the abrupt and unexpected manner in which the Brit, charge d'affaires at Madrid has broken off all diplomatic communication with the Spanish cabinet, I might well dispense with recalling to your excls attention the completely pacific proceedings which have constantly marked the system followed by my court towards England; but desiring, conformably to his maj.'s orders, to shew to the last moment that spirit of conciliation which constitutes the essence of my mission, and the distinguishing characteristic of my sovereign, I have thought it my duty to make yet one more effort, tending to shew in its true light the frank and friendly conduct which the king has not ceased to display since the rupture between France and England, amidst the difficulties of his situation with regard to the two belligerent powers.&#x2014;From the very moment that the king had learned the commencement of hostilities between France and England, his maj. gave all his attention to the manner in which he should conduct himself in order to prevent all room for discontent on the part of those two states, and to the system which he would have to follow in such a conjuncture, in order to conciliate his engagements as the ally of France, with his duties of friendship towards England. Although his maj. knew very well, that his quality of auxiliary to the 1st of these powers, was in no wise incompatible with that of friend to the 2d, he was, from the very first, perfectly sensible, and his opinion has been since confirmed by accounts from his minister at London, that the Brit, govt, would, with difficulty, consent to his furnishing to France succours, such as are stipulated by the treaty of 1796. In this persuasion, and in order to remove every hostile appearance in his connections with the latter power, he resolved to propose to his ally the conclusion of a new treaty, by which pecuniary succours should be substituted for the succours in troops and ships, which he had engaged to furnish to France by the treaty of alliance. After long and difficult negotiations, the king congratulated himself on having at last
<image src="S1V0003P0I0111"/>
<col>193</col>
obtained the object of his amicable views, by the conclusion of a treaty of subsidy.&#x2014;Confiding in the uprightness of his intentions, and in the pacific sentiments which had prompted him to take this step, his majesty was fully persuaded that the Brit, govt, would not fail to appreciate this very unequivocal mark of friendship. The complaints brought forward soon afterwards by Mr. Frere, against the above-mentioned convention&#x2014;complaints which he has at different times renewed, though always in very vague terms, and without ever making an essential and decisive point of them, were therefore a real subject of surprize to his Catholic maj. Nevertheless, answers full of moderation and candour were by his order made, to them, in which answers were set forth the motives which had led him to make a treaty of which the English govt, had the less room for complaint, as it was solely out of regard to them that his maj. had determined to conclude it.&#x2014;At nearly the same time, his Brit, maj.'s minister having addressed to my court representations on the armaments which he pretended were carrying on in our ports, and which he supposed to be directed against England, his maj. ordered answers to be in like manner made to him, that the views of the Spanish govt, were very far from any motive of hostility; that his Brit. maj. could not mistake pacific intentions of the king of Spain, who had given him so many incontestible proofs of friendship; and that these proofs were manifested as well in the sacrifices made by the king to secure peace, as in the severity exercised, even before it was demanded towards those of his subjects who had acted contrary to the duties of neutrality. In fine, that, according to these data, there did not exist the least cause for apprehending that Spain would engage in further armaments, for that would be acting against her pacific system." At the same time, as the court of Madrid was not enabled to form an exact and fixed judgment of the principles and the conduct which the Brit. govt, proposed to follow; on account of the equivocal language in which Mr. Frere always enveloped his representations, it invited him to express himself in a clear and precise manner as to the intentions and the views of his govt, with regard to Spain. It was in consequence of this frank and friendly invitation, that his Brit, maj.'s minister at last particularized to my court, in a note Winch he transmitted to it on the 18th Feb.
<col>194</col>
last, the conditions on which his govt. would be disposed to recognize the neutrality of Spain. These conditions were, the suspension of all ulterior armament, and the prohibition of the sale of prizes in his maj.'s dominions. Not having exacted Others, it is perfectly clear, that the Brit, ministry engaged itself thereby to respect the neutrality, as soon as the king, my master, should acquiesce in these conditions.&#x2014;His maj. who had resolved to make every sacrifice compatible with the welfare of his people, in order to secure to them the benefits of a solid peace, determined to forbid the sale of prizes in his kingdoms; which prohibition took place on the 23d March last; and with regard to the armaments, he renewed the assurances which the Brit. govt, had already received on this head; assurances the sincerity of which was well guaranteed by the lively interest which his maj. has constantly attached to the maintenance of peace, since the rupture between France and England. &#x2014;This eagerness of the king to fulfil all the wishes of the Brit, cabinet, and thp painful sacrifice which his maj. had just made of the advantages which the sale of prizes in the ports of Spain held out to Spanish commerce, ought to have completed the confidence of England, and to have eradicated from the opinion of its govt, every atom of doubt on the pacific sentiments of my court; accordingly, the English minister seemed to have felt all the value of such sacrifices, since he brought forward no more complaints, and that the most perfect harmony seemed every day to unite more and more the two govts.&#x2014;Such were the relations subsisting between the two nations, when, in Sept. last, some discontent having broken out in Biscay, his maj. ordered the embarkation of a part of the troops which were in garrison at Ferrol, in order to their being transported without delay to the place where the disorder had occurred. Then it was, that the enemies of Spain, sounding the alarm, under the pretext that considerable armaments were carrying on in her ports, sought to communicate their feigned uneasiness to the Brit. govt, by placing before them in the most hostile colours, a measure as foreign to the interests of England, as it was indispensable to the stifling in their birth movements which had manifested themselves in a province of Spain. Then it was, that the Brit, charge d'affaires, hurried on by reports which male-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0112"/>
<col>195</col>
Volence had exaggerated, and without examining either the nature, the extent, or the well-known object of these pretended armaments, made complaints of them ill a note, dated 27th Sept. last, in which he represented them as an hostile aggression against his govt, and as a defiance given to England, and expressed himself in other terms not less injurious to the reputation of the king, than contrary to the relations which subsisted between the two countries. &#x2014;Although such reproaches, in return for the proofs which the king had always given of his eagerness to strengthen the bonds of friendship which united him to the Brit, govt, were of a Mature to excite in him the greatest surprize, his maj. nevertheless, directed answers to the intemperate representations of Mr. Frere, to be made with that moderation which is the most striking point in the history of his political conduct; a moderation the more signal from this circumstance, that the above mentioned armament, which excited so much sensation was confined within the limits prescribed by an agreement which was concluded on the 19th Oct. 1803, between the two govts, since it was restricted to the same number of vessels which were already armed before this epoch; and what proves still more clearly the pacific views of the king is, that the armament in question had been suspended by his maj.'s orders some days before the Brit, charge d'affaires had brought forward his complaint on the subject.&#x2014;Notwithstanding this, notwithstanding the assurances of friendship and good faith expressed in the answer of my court, notwithstanding the absolute cessation of these pretended armaments, on which the enemies of peace had founded their criminal hopes (a cessation of which the Brit, charge d'affaires could not be ignorant), instead of softening the menacing tone which he had at first adopted, Instead of resuming that friendly language which the perfect justification of my court required of him, he did but accumulate fresh reproaches, the harshness and injustice of which began to reveal the hostile, system which he has not since discontinued.&#x2014;The Brit. govt, on their side, forgetting on a sudden the pacific relations which they had maintained during several months with my sovereign, and without waiting for more exact and less suspicious information on our preparations at Ferrol, from whence it had received none but exaggerated accounts, brought by the Naiad,
<col>196</col>
and, which is still more astonishing, without paying attention to the information which I transmitted to it through the channel of your excl. on the innocence and the true object of these pretended armaments, did not hesitate to give that extraordinary order, which, as well from its nature, as from its disastrous consequences, must have struck with horror every cabinet in Europe. Instead of beginning by demanding explanations from my court on the subject of these alarms, it breaks off the good understanding which subsisted between the two nations, by an act of hostility of which the most rancorous wars scarcely afford an example; and, as if it feared that the explanations of the Spanish minister, and ulterior accounts from Spain, would force it to respect a neutrality, to which it seemed absolutely determined to put an end, it hastened to make war against her, without any previous declaration, and even in the midst of the most profound peace. The 5th of Oct. was witness to the shedding of the innocent blood of several women and children, who perished victims of an unheard-of violence! And this blood was shed by the hands of a nation whose govt, themselves declare afterwards that they are not at war with Spain!&#x2014;Before the news of this dreadful event came to the knowledge of the king, the Brit, charge d'affaires seems to have made it his business to exasperate his maj. by all imaginable means. Not being able to conceal from himself the frivolity of his accusations relative to our preparations at Ferrol, since their existence had ceased a long time before, he was obliged to call to his aid some new grievances, as slightly founded as they are destitute of good faith, He did not fail to make new demands, some of them contrary to what had been agreed upon between the two govts, the others entirely inadmissible, from their injurious tendency. Thus it is that he exacted from my court the engagement, "that no armament whatever should be carried on" in the ports of Spain, whilst his govt, and himself had consented that the naval forces of Spain should be kept up on the same footing as they were at the time of the above-mentioned agreement., Thus it is, that he pretended that his maj. had always refused to give a distinct explanation with regard to his engagements with France; that without this previous communication, the Brit. govt, had never been willing to consent to the neutrality of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0113"/>
<col>197</col>
Spain; in short, thus it is, that he ended, by imperiously demanding this communication, although without declaring what would be the ulterior conduct of his court, in case his maj. should acquiesce in this demand.&#x2014;The king, my master, might have refused an answer to this extraordinary summons. The inaccuracy of the suppositions on which it is founded, and the previous steps of the Brit, ministry, who, amongst the conditions fixed by England for the acknowledgment of the neutrality, had not comprised the necessity of a similar communication, sufficiently authorized his maj. not to attend to a demand of this nature. Your excl. knows that, immediately after the conclusion of the treaty of subsidy, the British government addressed to my eourt representations, the object of which was by no means to demand a distinct explanation with regard to the engagements which that, treaty contained, but positively "to declare that the furnishing the pecuniary advances, as stipulated in the convention concluded with France, could not be looked upon otherwise than as a war subsidy, &amp;c." These expressions, the very same as used by the British minister in the note which he delivered to this effect on the 3d of Dec. last, do not admit the doubt that his govt, was not at that time thoroughly acquainted with the contents of the above-mentioned convention. Had it been otherwise, could Mr. Frere have held this language without knowing the extent of our subsidies, especially after having declared in the same note, "that his govt, was disposed to overlook such pecuniary sacrifices as should not be of sufficient magnitude to force attention on account of their political effects?" If therefore they were then acquainted with the amount of the sums which his maj. had to pay to France, how could they now be ignorant of it? And not being ignorant of it, what end do they at present propose to themselves in demanding the disclosure of a secret which could never have been one to them?&#x2014;Supposing even that his maj.'s engagements with France, with respect to the subsidies, should still remain a mystery' to the Brit. govt, it would not be less true, that they have no longer the right to demand a distinct explanation on this subject, at least, as a condition essential to the maintenance of peace. If the Brit. govt. attached so much importance to this communication, that they thought it right to make it a condition, without which
<col>198</col>
they would not engage to respect the neutrality of Spain, they ought to have expressly declared so at the epoch, when, yielding to the solicitations of my master, they fixed the basis of a permanent and solid neutrality. Not having then acted in this manner, they had no longer a right to do so; for otherwise, that act, whereby the conditions essential to neutrality were settled, and the object of which was evidently to remove the uncertainty of those relations which subsisted between the two courts, would be entirely illusory, since it would still leave to England a facility of continually adding fresh conditions to those already agreed on. Hence it follows, that the Brit. govt, could no longer, exact a distinct explanation on the subject of the subsidies, as the price of their respect for the neutrality of Spain, so long as the two conditions relative to the armaments, and to the sale of prizes, should be strictly fulfilled.&#x2014;Notwithstanding all these motives, according to which the king might have dispensed with answering directly to this demand, his maj. putting himself above all those considerations naturally excited by the irregular conduct of Mr. Frere, has even condescended to make an explicit and satisfactory answer, in renewing to him a similar assurance to that which I had already given by his order to the Brit, govt, namely, that the subsidies stipulated by the convention are but an equivalent for the succours in troops and ships which he was obliged by the treaty of 1796 to furnish to France, and that, in that convention, there is no article prejudicial to England, or contrary to the laws of neutrality. This moderate, frank, and satisfactory answer of my court served but to produce fresh complaints on the part of the British charge d' affaires, who did not hesitate at the same time to demand his passports. His maj. constantly faithful to his principles of moderation, endeavoured to prevent, by every means compatible with his dignity, the consequences of so extraordinary a demand, and did not make any difficulty in reiterating to him again the most amicable and most frank assurance, as well on the subsidies, as on the armaments; but all his efforts have been useless. At length, perceiving that he was obstinate in wishing to leave Madrid, since in the space of 7 days he had 4 times demanded his passports, and that, at the last solicitation, he had even threatened to remain there as a, private individual, or
<image src="S1V0003P0I0114"/>
<col>199</col>
else to depart without passports, the king found himself under the necessity of granting them to him, however unpleasing for his maj. might be the consequence which would arise from so precipitate a step.&#x2014;At the same time that this unexpected stroke deprived his maj. of nearly all the hopes he had till then entertained, his heart was penetrated with the deepest affliction, on learning the dreadful event of the 5th of Oct. and the disastrous circumstances by which it had been accompanied. Although the details, which he received from all quarters, and the uniformity of all the accounts, gave to ibis intelligence all the force of an indubitable fact, his maj. under the influence of the invariable rectitude of his Sentiments, and not having as yet received official information on this head, flattered himself by calling in question the reality of a similar outrage: at; least he could not persuade himself that it had been caused by an order issued by the British govt. His maj. has consequently ordered me to demand of them categorical explanations on the detention of his frigates, on the instructions which may have been sent to the English commanders, and on the motives which may have induced the British charge d'affaires to break off all communication with the Spanish ministry.&#x2014;Notwithstanding the coincidence of such alarming intelligence, with the irregular conduct of Mr. Frere, the king could not resolve to take any measure which had the least appearance of hostility. So much had he at heart the continuance of peace! It was not till after having learnt, in an authentic manner, the act of violence exercised on the above-mentioned frigates, by virtue of an express order of the Brit. govt, that his maj. found himself under the necessity, in order to consult the interest of his people, to order an embargo to be laid, by way of reprisals, on all English property throughout his dominions&#x2014;lu this state of things, if the king can no longer flatter himself with the hope; of on accommodation, if the system manifested for some time past by England seems to render inevitable a rupture between two nations, of which the reciprocal interest ought to lead them to live always in good understanding with each other, his maj. has not at least abandoned the desire to listen to pacific overtures, and is still disposed to avail himself of all the means of conciliation which may be compatible with the dignity of his crown, and the safety of his kingdoms.&#x2014;But if,
<col>200</col>
notwithstanding this conciliatory and pacific declaration, which I have the honor, conformably to the wishes of the king my master, to make to your excl. the Brit, govt, should decide on taking the resolution to declare open war against him, his maj. in that case, confiding in the fidelity of his subjects, and in the purity of his conscience, will have recourse to those forces which Providence has entrusted to him for the defence of his people, and will commit to the fortune of war the result of a conflict which he has in no degree provoked, and with the consequences of which he will accordingly not have to reproach himself.

The expression in the chev. d'Anduaga's note is quite unintelligible to me. It appears to assert the existence of something of the nature of a written treaty, upon the subject of the Spanish armaments, and it assigns the 19th of Oct. 1803, as the date of this supposed agreement. It is certain, nevertheless, that no convention or agreement, either written or verbal, ever passed between M. Cevallos and me, either then, or at any other time. A declaration indeed was made in the notes, addressed to M. Cevallos, on the 24th Jan. and the 18th Feb stating, that his maj.'s govt, was disposed, in hopes of better times, to exercise for the present a discretional forbearance: yet that this forbearance would cease the moment that Spain departed from her <i>status quo</i> with respect to armaments.&#x2014;M. Cevallos, in his answer, has described this declaration as the basis of a neutrality binding upon G. Brit. Afterwards, in his' correspondence with my brother, whose first object was to bring back the Spanish armaments to the state in which they had been left in consequence of this declaration, M. Cevallos goes a step further, and calls it a convention of neutrality proposed by G. Brit. This is in his note of the 29th Oct. 1804, which can have no allusion, but to the declaration of the 24th Jan. and the 18th Feb. Again, in his note of the 3d Nov. he refers to a convention or treaty of neutrality of the 19th Oct. 1803; meaning, I suppose, the treaty of subsidy with France, the stipulations of which, though they have never been communicated, he refers to as known; and in a manner implying that they were mutually binding upon G. Brit, and Spain. I cannot but imagine that M. d'Anduaga must have been misled by these two circumstances, and that seeing it asserted in M. Cevallos' note of 29th Oct. that there existed a treaty of neutrality, which had been proposed by G, Brit, and again, in the note of the 3d of Nov. that the state of the armaments was to be regulated by a convention of the 19th Oct. he may have concluded that they were one and the same, and consequently
<col>202</col>
may have affixed to this imaginary treat/ the date of the one concluded with France. My conjecture may be wrong, but M. d'Anduaga's assertion appears to me inexplicable in any other way.&#x2014;I am, &amp;c. J. H. FRERE.</p>

I can assure your ldp. that every step has been adopted here which can add to our security and protection.

To the remonstrances which I thought it my duty to make to the governor at the Havanna, he answers, that nothing inconsistent with the rules of neutrality had taken place within his govt, and that he confined himself strictly to common, acts of humanity or hospitality to the French who had arrived there. This he asserts, although it is a notorious fact, that the whole of the extensive coast of the island of Cuba has for several months been a shelter and protection to the numerous French privateers who infest those seas, and has afforded them safe and convenient places of deposit for their prizes. In the Havanna itself, armed vessels have been fitted out by the French, have proceeded to sea, and immediately returned with valuable Brit, prizes, part of whose cargoes
<image src="S1V0003P0I0117"/>
<col>205</col>
have been disposed of in that port without any questions or interference. There are now in the Havanna four valuable homeward bound Jamaica ships, and 4 brigs, which they have recently captured, and carried to that place. They have been purchasing vessels and arming them there, and have been allowed a degree of licence and latitude which can be looked upon as little short of actual hostility on the part of the Spanish govt. The French squadron in the Havanna amounts to about 10 armed vessels of different descriptions, and they have purchased Amer. ships for transports. If they proceed towards Europe, I think it probable they will meet with adm. Mitchell's squadron from Bermuda, as I have sent early information to him of their probable motions.</p>

Understanding I could get those things with more facility at Ferrol, I applied to the governor of that
<col>210</col>
place, who advised me to go to Corunna, where I might anchor, and get whatever I wanted. Under all these circumstances, I came off here last evening, and was piloted to a anchorage by a pilot, authorized by you to do so. Before sun-set I sent an officer from this ship on shore with the rank of capt. of infantry, with a letter to your excl. this officer was treated with great insult, and obliged to return to me without being permitted to deliver the letter he was charged with, and this too in the presence of the officers belonging to the French frigate.&#x2014;This morning at 6 you sent off what was represented to me to be the commandant of the port, and 3 gentlemen of the board of health; they were with me near an hour, and made many professions of friendship on the part of your excl. and an apology for your conduct to the Brit, officer last evening; from which I attribute the treatment he met with to human frailty guided by particular influence. They informed me likewise that the officers of this ship were by your excl.'s directions permitted to go on shore whenever they pleased, and your conversation since that with the British consul upon the subject, confirmed me in the opinion that, if they were permitted to go on shore, they would be treated with that respect they had a right to expect. I sent two of them afterwards on duty to get refreshments, but it would appear that your excl.'s professions of friendship only led to wish for fresh opportunities to insult the king's officers under my command, for, when they landed, the sentinels pointed bayonets to their breasts, and drove them into the boats again, and made them stay there for 2 hours, and then they returned on board, and this too is said tol>e by your order, under a false pretence of my having taken St, Domingo ships. Sir, I told the officers of health this morning, that I had not taken any since I left England, and individually you dare not doubt my word; in my public situation you ought to place more confidence. I will not trespass much longer on your excl.'s time or patience, but I regret exceedingly you are so badly advised. I must therefore request your excl, will inform me in writing, for the information of his maj.'s ministers, why the king of England's ship under my command is deprived of the rights of neutrality? I hope sincerely your excl.'s conduct on this occasion may not lead to consequences of the most serious nature. Sir, I shall conclude my cor-

Wallis, for proceeding to that port to water, upon assurance, before given by the capt. gen. of his readiness to furnish the necessaries that ship stood in need of. I am happy to inform you, that this correspondence, although a little awkward at first, terminated at last amicably, the governor expressing his concern that he could not permit the officers to come on shore, and excusing himself of any intended disrespect. The motives I acted upon were two, the 1st to obtain a direct and digested account of the proceedings of the French squadron, and their probable objects; the other, to enable me to supply the Mars with water, so as to retain her on her station as long as her provisions lasted. la this particular I have failed, the frigate getting only 30 tons; and I do not think, after what passed, and the manifest influence the French officers have over the capt. gen. that he will allow of the Naiad's' watering again. On the former part we were more successful, and understand that positive orders have been received from Madrid, not only to equip the whole of the Spanish fleet at Ferrol, but to refit in every particular the French squadron, and to allow them to impress all Frenchmen in their ports, to complete their complements. We learn, however, by the same means, that the arsenal is extremely low in every department; and it is said, they have not stores sufficient to complete the French ships alone.</p>

If I may judge from their conduct towards this squadron, I should suppose there can be little doubt but that there is something of this kind in agitation between France and Spain at this time; I have therefore constantly given orders to the frigates not to anchor at Corunna, when they have sent their boats in to gain intelligence, &amp;c. The other day I directed Capt. Prowse to send his boat into a bay to get some sand; when she landed on the beach, an officer's party came down to order them off; but on a little expostulation the officer (who was an Irishman) said, "he might take the sand, "but that his orders were to order them "off directly." As a corroborating circumstance of my opinion respecting the hostile appearances of the Spaniards, I find they are very busy here in remounting their cannon upon their batteries; and they say the French threaten to march 40,000 men into their country directly, if they do not join them.</p>

the castle of Palmo, that a boat belonging to the squadron under your command, and having an English officer on board has past through the mouth of this harbour, and entered it in the middle of the night, without obeying the governor's orders not to proceed to their destination before day-light, according to the established orders for all boats and small vessels, either national or strangers.&#x2014;I am also informed, that the squadron under your command has anchored at the mouth of the harbour between the batteries, which greatly annoys the coming in or going out.&#x2014;Your eminence knows that I have strictly conformed myself to the laws of nations and of neutrality, not only by facilitating the supplying the squadron under your command with meat, bread, and all other provisions, refreshments, and succours, according to the rules of hospitality, but that even I did not object to your ships entering the harbours under my command, when the hardships of the sea and the damages sustained by the weather made it necessary; but as it is contrary to the same laws and rules of neutrality, that the boats of the squadron under your command should enter this port contrary to orders, in the night-time, which is not allowed even with flags of truce; or that the same squadron, without being forced to it by distress of weather, or any other necessity, should anchor at the harbour's mouth, and in the very entrance of it; I find myself obliged to request your eminence to acquaint me with the motive which may have induced you to act in this manner, and I have no doubt that henceforward your eminence will take example by my conduct, and faithfully observe the laws of nations and neutrality, by not sending your boats at night into our ports, and making use of the Spanish territories, harbours, and succours, but as much as hospitality requires, and so as not to give room to suspect that I connive at the abuse of that hospitality to the prejudice of other nations, which are equally on terms of neutrality with this country, and have ships of war in this harbour.

find that it wears so much the complexion of real complaint. The want of a person to translate the Castilian language has delayed my reply; and I have to apprehend that we have not put a proper construction on all its parts. I did not, however, lose a moment in calling to account the officer who bad broken my positive orders, by entering your harbour in the night. His defence I inclose herewith, observing only, that this young officer was actuated by no improper motive whatever; it was the giddiness of youth. The boat was certainly not armed, and was the smallest in the cutter. But so little am I disposed to justify the opinion, that I have put him under arrest, to be tried by a court martial, where he will meet the punishment due to his insubordination.&#x2014;I trust, however (and have great pleasure in the expectation), from the personal inclination your excl. has so uniformly evinced, by affording the squadron of his Brit. maj. every supply consistent with neutrality and friendship, that this trivial circumstance (which I could not control) will not lead to disturb the good understanding and harmony so happily commenced. I shall manifest, by every means, my strong inclination for its continuance, and my regret at any event which may disturb it. With respect to the occasional anchorage of the ships under my command, your excl. has been misinformed. I trust it is not such as can give umbrage to your excl. or to the Spanish nation. I am sent upon the coast of Galicia by the king my master, to protect the commerce of his subjects trading to the ports of Spain. In performing this service, it cannot with truth be said, that I have given trouble to the ships of any nation, either entering or departing from them. I have acted up to the spirit of exact neutrality, and the existing treaties; and, with the exception of the cutter (to which your excl. had given permission to go into Ferrol to receive supplies), there is no ship anchored within the batteries, but in the open ocean. In easterly winds I occasionally anchor to prevent being blown off; and in westerly winds I anchor to prevent being shipwrecked upon the coast. I cannot give your excl. two more powerful reasons; and I entertain no doubt that they will prove satisfactory, and that I shall continue to experience the same attention and respect to the flag of my sovereign, us is shewn to that of any other

The tide was setting strong into the harbour, and in a few minutes the boat was hurried up under Castle Palmo, and hailed by the sentry, and ordered to go back, upon which I answered in French, that it was an English boat, looking for a buoy broke from the cutter's anchor, and begged to go on; after calling, a serjeant, I believe, he said I might do so. The boat was unarmed, and I returned in a few minutes. I had no improper motive whatever; and I know the most positive orders were given against any boat moving by night. The hurry of the moment, and the rapidity of the tide, gave me no time for reflection, and to that alone is the circumstance to be attributed, and for which I am very sorry.</p>

<title>[ADDITIONAL FORCE BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00953"><member>Lord Hawkesbury,</member><membercontribution> by command of his majesty, presented certain military accounts and documents, chiefly respecting the levies under the additional force act, which were ordered to lie on the table.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00954"><member>Earl Darnley</member><membercontribution> thereupon rose, and expressed himself not particularly desirous to agitate the proposition of which he had given notice on Thursday next. He should therefore move, that the order for summoning their ldps. upon Thursday next be discharged, and that an order for a similar purpose be made for a future day, which, in consideration of some important matter being proposed by a noble friend of his for Monday, he should propose to be on tomorrow se'nnight. The noble earl accordingly moved that the lords be summoned for that day.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00955"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> wished it to be understood, that the arrangement just proposed by the noble earl did not proceed from any thing wished for by his maj.'s ministers in that house; it would prove no sort of accommodation to them, as, if the proposition the noble earl had given notice of, was to be discussed distinctly from the subject of the general military state of the country, it was a matter of indifference to them when it was agitated.&#x2014;While on his legs, the noble secretary requested a noble lord, then in his place (King), to give him an idea of the nature of his intended motion on Monday, as he had stated it so generally in the first instance, that he could not satisfactorily comprehend its object.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00956"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> professed himself willing to give the information desired by the noble secretary.

<title>[WAR WITH SPAIN.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00957"><member>Lord-Grenville</member><membercontribution> said, that although he was prepared to
<col>220</col>
come to a discussion of the Spanish rupture, on the information which he had obtained from those papers which his maj.'s ministers, after 2 months consideration, had laid before parliament, and which they, no doubt, conceived sufficient for the full understanding of the subject; he must confess that he was glad that the additional papers had been brought down, as they had contributed to throw more light on the question. There were still many chasms in the correspondence, which he was anxious to see filled up, and which, no doubt, ministers would feel it to be their duty to communicate to the house. In Mr. Frere's letter to lord Hawkesbury, of the 5th March, 1804, he stated the subject of a conversation he had with the prince of peace on the morning of that day, and of his having been referred by him to M. Cevallos, for the communication of the treaty which had been concluded between Spain and France, relative to the neutrality of the former country. No traces of what had passed in that conference appeared in the papers which had been laid before the house. As the object of that conference was of the utmost moment, he must suppose that Mr. Frere had felt it to be his duty to communicate it to his govt.; and the information which that communication would afford, he thought, was very necessary, previous to the discussion of the subject. There were also 3 notes written on the 23d and 24th of Feb. by Mr. Frere to M. Cevallos, and answered by the latter on the 27th, of which he wished copies or extracts should be laid before their ldps.: they were alluded to in M. D'Anduaga's letter of the 30th March last to lord Hawkesbury. He would how move the first of his series of motions.&#x2014;Before the question was put on the noble lord's motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00958"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> said, that it was not the intention of ministers to withhold any information which could with propriety be granted; he wished, however, that the noble lord would not press his motion at present, but allow govt. time to consider which of the papers it would be in their power to produce; they would be able to do that by to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00959"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> said, it would be extremely inconvenient for him to come down to-morrow; however, if ministers could not make up their minds immediately, he must be under the necessity either of attending to-morrow, or of getting some other noble lord to move for him.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0003P0I0125"/>
<col>221</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00960"><member>Lord Mulgrave</member><membercontribution> said, that it had been his duty to make the selection of the papers which had been laid before parliament, from a very voluminous correspondence; and as no part of the negotiation had been conducted by him, he could not be supposed to be as fully master of the subject as the noble lord who lately filled the situation, which was now unworthily filled by him. Possibly, some papers might have been omitted, which should have been produced. All he could say, was, that if his noble friend would favour him with a list of the papers he intended to move for, he would come to a determination as to whether they could or ought to be laid before the house by to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00961"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> observed, that he could not refuse acceding to the noble lord's proposal. He would put the list of motions into the noble sec.'s hands, and trust to his honour and discretion to produce such of them as he should think necessary to be made public.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00962"><member>Lord Mulgrave</member><membercontribution> expressed his obligations to his noble friend, and said, that he would take care to apprise him, in the course of the morning, how far his motions could be complied with.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00963"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> said, he would state, for the satisfaction of the house, what the papers were which he thought should be laid before their ldps. He wished, exclusive of those which he had already mentioned, that the answers which had been returned by lord Hawkesbury, to the different letters of M. d'Anduaga, should be brought forward. The document, however, which he was the most anxious to obtain, was the information imparted to lord Harrowby by M. d'Anduaga, respecting the armaments at Ferrol, as upon that would depend the propriety of the orders for the capture of the Spanish frigates. Although that information might have been verbally communicated, it was to be presumed, notwithstanding, that his noble friend had made some minute of the conversation for the information of the other members of the administration. If that were not so, it would yet be practicable to give their ldps. the information besought, by applying to his noble friend in the same way that information had been obtained from Mr. Frere, respecting a point on which there was some doubt. He wished also to obtain a copy of such answer, if any, as had been made to M. d'Anduaga's letter of the 22d Dec. He wished also for a copy
<col>222</col>
of M. Cevallos' note of the 27th Feb; 1804 to Mr. Frere, and which he supposed there could be no objection to furnish; for what was proper for him to receive, Could not be considered as improper to be laid before parliament. The noble lord made no motion, but handed the list of motions to the noble secretary of state.&#x2014;Adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-00964">Lord Henniker took the oaths and his seat for the county of Rutland.&#x2014;Sir E. Nepean brought up an account of the expences and debt of the navy, to the 31st Dec. 1804.&#x2014;The coal merchants' indemnity, and the Surry iron railway bill was read 2d time, and ordered to be committed.&#x2014;Mr. Rose brought up the bill for making better provision for the quarrantine service, which was read a. 1st time. On his, moving that the bill be read a 2d time, he said, he felt it necessary to explain to the house the objects of the bill. The act of the 39th and 40th of the king invested his maj. and council with certain powers, which it was the purpose of this bill to enlarge and extend. His maj. by that bill, was enabled by his proclamation to subject to quarantine all vessels coming from countries infected with the plague. The present bill extended the like power with respect to ships coming from any countries infected with any other epidemical diseases which might be dangerous to the health of this country. It also went to empower his maj. to force persons who may have landed in this country from on board of such vessels clandestinely, to return on board forthwith on pain of death. It also had a clause to indemnify the members of the privy council for obliging certain persons who had landed from the wreck of a vessel from Gibraltar, and obliged to perform quarantine, to return on board of the vessel so wrecked, and take with them the persons resident in a public house where they had taken refuge, after their landing, in consequence of which some of those persons, were drowned. He admitted the case was certainly a hard one; but it was but a partial evil compared with the much more extensive and alarming one which the order was calculated to prevent. He concluded by moving, "that the bill be read a 2d time on Friday next. Ordered.&#x2014;Mr. Alexander brought up the report of

The papers he meant to move for, were merely such as were necessary to put the house in possession of the subject. The hon. gent, then moved, for a copy of lord Castlereagh's letter, dated 9th Sept. 1804, to the chairman of the court of directors, relative to Prince of Wales's Island, with the inclosures contained in that letter; also, an estimate of the expence of building a 74-gun ship, and a 36-gun frigate at Bombay; also, copies of two letters from Sir A.

Middleton and others, authorising them to act according as they should deem right, with respect to certain subjects contained in the reports of the commissioners of naval inquiry."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00967"><member>The Chanc. of the Excheq.</member><membercontribution> said, this commission did not answer either to the description given of it in the motion, or to that which the hon. gent. gave in the observation with which he prefaced the motion. The hon. gent. had described the commission as giving large and discretionary powers: it gave no such powers, it limited precisely the powers it gave, and the objects of those powers. The commissioners were only impowered to digest and report to the admiralty the beat means
<col>224</col>
of carrying into execution such reforms as should appear to them to be proper, in consequence of the reports of the commissioners of naval inquiry. This was the whole of the discretion granted to them. He had no objection to the production of the commission; he only said thus muck, to prevent its being understood that such an unlimited discretion was given as the hon. gent. supposed. A copy of the commission was ordered.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[WAR WITH SPAIN.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00970"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> rose to inquire whether anymore papers were to be laid before the house, in addition to the two sets which had already been delivered? There still appeared to him to be a very great deficiency in those popers, and he wished to know whether this deficiency was likely to be supplied by the production of any additional papers?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00971"><member>The Chanc. of the Excheq.</member><membercontribution> replied, that there were some more papers to be delivered, and that he expected them every minute. The hon. gent. would then be better able to judge, whether there still remained any deficiency or not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00972"><member>Mr. Grey,</member><membercontribution> after all the information which the papers already moved for contained, still expressed himself of opinion that there were several important deficiencies to be supplied, and points of the highest consequence to be explained. The deficiencies at present existing, were of papers from the office of the sec, for the foreign department, and the board of admiralty. Of the latter he should, at present, say nothing, because all the papers he had moved for were not yet produced, and till they were on the table, he could not ascertain to what extent the deficiency of evidence existed. As to the deficiencies from
<image src="S1V0003P0I0127"/>
<col>225</col>
the sec. of state's office, he had to offer a few observations. What, in the first place, he wished to ascertain, was, whether, previous to the 2d June, down to the 24th Nov. there existed any papers illustrative of the steps taken by our ministers to obtain any satisfactory explanation of the treaty of St. Ildefonso. He was also anxious to know whether, during the long interval betwixt the 21st Jan. and the 29th Nov. no instructions whatever were given by Lord Hawkesbury, or the person who succeeded him in the office of foreign sec. to our minister at Madrid, on the subjects in dispute betwixt the two countries. If no such instructions were given, it was fit that this should be stated to the house. If, on the other hand, instructions were given, it was proper that the house should be in possession of them to enable them to form a fair judgment of the whole of this very extraordinary negotiation. On a former day he had moved for a copy of all information received of the passage of French troops through the Spanish territories, referred to in Mr. Frere's dispatch of the 9th Sept. It was quite clear, that in consequence of the remonstrances of our minister, the future passage of French troops through Spain was prevented; but while this was admitted, it was equally evident that some explanations took place on the subject. Now, it was very important for the house to know what these explanations Were; but the house had hitherto no information on the subject. The existence of these explanations was indeed sufficiently evident, from references in the dispatches of the 24th Nov. but the house knew not in what spirit they were couched, or to what extent they proceeded. Respecting the convention alluded to in the correspondence, he was now convinced that what the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Pitt) had stated, was correct; that such an agreement between the govt. of Spain and this country had no existence. But it was quite as manifest that the Spanish govt. did, in consequence of what had taken place in various conferences with our minister, suppose that their neutrality was to depend on certain understood conditions. In various parts of the correspondence it appeared that ministers had made various demands for a copy of the treaty by which Spain was to furnish subsidiary resources to France. He wished to be informed whether ministers were ever in possession of an official Copy of this document. The knowledge of
<col>226</col>
this fact was highly interesting, because it would be possible to form an estimate, whether the terms of it differed widely from those terms on which, in the, first instance, our forbearance was founded; whether it was materially contrary to the principles on which there was a chance of the preservation of Spanish neutrality; or whether Spain, at the time the rupture took place, had shewn any disposition to alter her conduct in any way likely to affect the interests of this country? It was not attempted to be denied, in the papers already on the table, that very important conferences had taken place betwixt the Spanish ambassador here, and the sec. for the foreign department. The chev. d'Anduaga alluded to the conferences in various parts of his dispatches. It was fair to presume, not only that these conferences were highly interesting, but it was not at all unlikely that the principal part of the discussion that took place was committed to writing. The Spanish ambassador spoke in his dispatches of explanations Which these conferences produced, and it would surely be very strange indeed, if the sec. for the foreign department never communicated any part of the discussions to our minister at Madrid, as affording him a rule for the regulation of his conduct in the course of the various discussions which took place on all the points in dispute. From the Chev. d'Anduaga's dispatches of the 3d Aug. it was quite undeniable that the conferences of the 29th and 30th Aug. involved matters of the highest consequence. In the whole of that dispatch, it was plain that his excl. viewed them in that light, and it was not less obvious, that in a similar light he had represented them to his court. If he attached so much consequence to them, was it presuming too much to suppose that they must have been at least equally interesting to our minister at Madrid? It was next to an impossibility that he should have been left altogether ignorant of their principal importance; but not a word of what had taken place betwixt Lord Hawkesbury, his successor, and the Spanish ambassador, appeared in the papers already on the table. The house, however, ought not to be kept in the dark, respecting any part of so interesting a business; and he certainly did think, that if any documents connected with these conferences were in existence, they ought to be produced. He should therefore feel it his duty to move for the production of all
<image src="S1V0003P0I0128"/>
<col>227</col>
the notes which might have been presented at these different conferences to which the Spanish ambassador refers in various parts of his dispatches, and on which he appears to lay peculiar stress, as if in these the terms of the Spanish neutrality had been in a great measure adjusted. He next wished to call the attention of the house to the two notes of the Spanish minister on the 4th and the 11th of Nov. in which he gives an official explanation of the state of the Spanish armaments. It was important for the house then to know what was the information on which ministers proceeded when the orders for the detention of the Spanish frigates were issued. It was material to compare the intelligence received from our naval officers abroad, with the solemn assurances and explanations given by the Spanish ambassador resident at our court. Till this information was before the house, it was impossible to determine how far these orders were or were not called for by the actual state of things. If ministers had any such information, the house had a right to demand it. If ministers had no such information, it was not at all very doubtful what opinion ought to be entertained of them for issuing the orders. The hon. member also expressed a desire to have all letters or dispatches which took place from February to May 1804, produced. It was fair to presume that letters of an important kind were written during that interval. In the letter of the 1st of May, a letter of the 18th of Feb. is referred to, and he wished to have that letter produced, as affording some explanation of the manner in which any expectation of the continuance of Spanish neutrality could be preserved. He had thought it his duty to throw out these observations, not with the view of embarrassing govt. but solely with the object of coming, with full information, to the discussion of a subject which he could not help considering one of the most momentous which ever was submitted to the decision of the house of commons. As to deficiencies from the board of admiralty, he should at present say nothing, till he had an opportunity of seeing whether the papers he had moved for were satisfactorily produced.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00973"><member>The Chanc. of the Excheq.</member><membercontribution> said, the papers he expected to present this day would afford as good answers as could be given to the inquiries of the hon. gent. There were
<col>228</col>
two official letters from M. Anduaga. There were no others that could well be produced; for he did not conceive that mere memorandums, not delivered officially, or by command of the govt. or the ambassador, could be made objects of any serious proceeding. He would not now enter into any argument on the subject, which the hon. gent, professed to avoid, though he, at the same time, took occasion to insinuate an opinion upon it. The papers which were about to be presented to the house would be accompanied by a schedule, which directed how to apply them to the points. These contained all the information govt. could give. As to the written accounts of conferences, there were none, unless mere memorandums, which were not of a shape to be produced or relied upon. With respect to the convention of St. Ildefonso, all his maj.'s govt. knew about it was in the papers before the house. They knew it existed, and had some conjectures as to its provisions; but they had no official or authentic information upon it, such as could be made the subject of a communication.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00974"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> strongly contended for the importance of having such explanations as look place at different conferences alluded to in the dispatches laid before the house. The explanations contained in the conferences of the 9th and the 30th of March, must, from the language of the letter of the 1st of May, have been highly interesting, and ought, by all means, to be produced. The chanc. of the excheq. had indeed stated, that mere notes, presented by an ambassador, perhaps merely offering a private opinion, and not authorized by his court, could not afford any information to the house. He, for his part, begged leave to argue that this was not a fair view of the subject. It was not possibe to conceive from the language of the Spanish ambassador, when alluding to explanations which had taken place at conferences, that he delivered in unauthorized notes. It was, on the contrary, quite evident that he alluded to authorized explanations, in which he laid down the principles and views of his court. It was impossible to believe that the notes which passed on such occasion were uninteresting. The presumption was certainly directly the reverse, and the house ought to have an opportunity of exercising their judgment on the subject. He was therefore anxious for the production, of all such explanations as would tend to
<image src="S1V0003P0I0129"/>
<col>229</col>
throw light on this most interesting subject. There was in the perusal of the papers a circumstance which puzzled him considerably, and which required a good deal of explanation. Our minister, Mr. Frere, in a letter of the 12th of Nov. stated, that in consequence of some discussions with the prince of peace, he should demand a conference. Now it was a matter of some consequence to ascertain whether ever this conference took place, and if it did take place, what was the result of it, or what explanation it produced. It was hardly to be supposed that it should not have been demanded after Mr. Frere, in a letter to the sec. for the foreign department, had expressed an opinion of its expediency. But the house had not a tittle of information on the subject. He wished to have this deficiency, with those pointed out by his hon. friend, fully supplied, previous to entering on the general question.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00975"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> argued, that the notes given in by the Spanish ambassador at the conferences alluded to, were, if not official, at most, important documents. They were representations of the principles and policy of the Spanish govt. and in that light were highly requisite to guide the judgment of the house. That they were merely minutes and not signed in the usual diplomatic, style was a matter of no consideration. Their spirit was not on account of their form at all affected. He should therefore, to-morrow, move for copies of the notes delivered, and of explanations which took place at those conferences to which the Spanish ambassador in his letters alluded. Here the discussion terminated, and shortly after,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-00976"><member>The Chanc. of the Excheq.</member><membercontribution> presented to the house some further papers relative to the war with Spain; which were ordered to lie on the table, and to be printed. The following are correct copies of the said papers:</membercontribution></p>

They, as well as most of the others, will require very great repairs, there being only 3 judged to require but a moderate one, and, in the opinion of good judges, are not fit for any thing but to be broken up. There is a total want of timber in the arsenal, where there is hardly any but the country pine; and, in other respects, it is but very poorly provided.</p>

The new frigate Vengeance built at Mahon, and arrived latterly from Carthagena, is to be attached to the squadron; she appears to be a fine frigate, and can mount 40 guns.

Halket, which reached here the 30th; on the 31st, and 1st of Feb. I dispatched the Racoon, and La Superieure schooner, to aid the Snake, Stark, and Sandwich, in resisting any attempt that might be made on that colony; and on the 29th ult.

On my being in eight of this port, the signal was mane for an English ship. The French general here sent a French Privateer out for the express purpose of taking my ship; but not being of force sufficient to attack the ship, she thought proper to haul off. There are 5 privateers now here, of different descriptions; one brig fitting out on purpose to take this ship when she sails. The said brig mounts 18 guns, and full of men. One schooner of 6 guns; and the others mount 4 guns each, and carry from 50 to 60 men. I understand they are determined on taking the Ship. I shall have on board, when sailing, 30,000 sterling; and unless I have some protection, I am undetermined on sailing. One of the before-mentioned privateers has brought in here a large ship, named the British Queen, of St. John, that sailed with the last convoy from Jamaica. She parted with the fleet, and came through the Gulph. She was captured off Cape Antonio by a privateer of one gun. These privateers make prizes of Danes, Americans, and every thing unarmed.

Upon the 31st sailed his maj.'s urea visitation} her destination Ferrol; 2 others are pre-paring here to follow her, the Santa Justa and Liebre; the whole said to be intended to proceed to the Havanna, with stores, and to return from thence with timber for the arsenals. Orders are said to have been received for laying the keels of some ships and frigates, and to begin to build as soon as timber may arrive.&#x2014;Upon the 7th April the frigate Amphitrite sailed from. the Havanna; she had gone from this, and with her sailed the frigate Neustra Senora Delao, of that department; their destination for Vera Cruz, there to join the frigates, Sabina and Vengenza, there to take aboard treasure, to be conveyed to this place, where they may now soon be expected. They will probably bring with them from 10 to 12 million of dollars.&#x2014;Of the ships which have been fitted out at Ferrol, the san Fulgencio, of 66 guns, is under orders, and is getting ready to proceed for Vera Cruz, from whence she will probably return with treasure. She is reputed one of the fastest sailing ships in his maj.'s navy. By letters received lately from Lima, there is advice that 3 king's frigates were completing their register of money; it will probably run to about 3 millions of dollars upon each; they were expected to sail about the 15th Feb. and were to touch at Montevideo for intelligence, and there to put themselves under the command of the Gifu de Esquadra, or brig, don F. de Bustamente, who has been the naval commander there for some time, who is to take the command, and to return with them for Spain; they may be expected in August, and will come rich.&#x2014;The ships that have been fitted out at the Carracca have but few men on board, and no steps taking, indicating a desire of soon manning them. Two of them are still in dock, completing their repairs. The number of additional carpenters and caulkers lately collected there, and which may go to about 1000, are employed upon the different vessels laid up there in ordinary, which are all of them to be overhauled, and to have repairs necessary to prevent many of them

from sinking. They are about 10 in number, exclusive of the 6 which have been fitted or are fitting out, and of the Bahama and Argonauta, which came round from Carthagena; 4 of them are judged to be incapable of being repaired, and only fit to be broken up.&#x2014;The l'Aigle, corvette Torche, aud brig Argus, French, which have been so long here, are completely manned and victualled for 6 months, and appear to be now waiting to proceed to sea.</p>

The department has a sufficient provision of pitch, tar, hemp, rope, and cables, and of sail cloth. I do not find any quantity of naval stores is expected from the Baltic this season, or that there are any contracts.&#x2014;Nitre frigates, 4 of which from Vera Cruz, are expected soon from thence, Lima, &amp;c.: 3 of them from Vera Cruz had sailed: the Venganza we learn is arrived at Ferrol, or Vigo, with 3,100,000 dollars. The Sabina and Amphitrite, which sailed with her from-Vera Gruz, and having equal sums on board, are said to

Lave put into Teneriffe, arid all of them with reduced crews, from having lain at Vera Cruz during the sickly season. They left the Rufina, which was to have followed them the 23d June, and may be every day expected. These frigates, and the others from Lima, &amp;c. it is computed may bring about 24 millions of dollars.&#x2014;The Castilla from Ferrol arrived here the 15th.</p>

The frigate Magdalena is continuing to be fitted out at the Carracas, to proceed for America. The frigate Venganza, which arrived latterly from Vera Cruz with money, and the frigate the Prueba, which has been in readiness some time in Galicia, are. under orders to proceed soon for Vera Cruz, to bring money. One frigate which remained at Vera Cruz is expected soon with a similar sum, for the king, as the 3 others which are arrived. A very considerable sum, which it is judged may amount to above 5 millions, is expected from the same place, on account of the merchants, and to come in the merchant ships expected from that part in the course of this year. The frigates expected from Lima and Buenos Ayres, 4 or 5 in number, and 1 from Carthagena, are not yet arrived; they may be looked for in what remains of this year, and may be expected to bring in all from 8 to 10 millions for account of the king and of the merchants.

much as before; the old ship Rayo, sister ship to the Gibraltar, is changing into a 3 decker, her bottom has been found very good at this length of time since she has been built; since making out this. report, I am informed she registered seamen from the different ports belonging to this department, viz. from that of Ayamante to that of Algesires, both inclusive, have been ordered to repair to the Carracxa; this would indicate an intention to man the ship? which are fitted out; I will be attentive to the results, and to know how far it may be carried into effect, and as to the object proposed by it; giving information as to the result.</p>

Should the Spaniards' have any hostile views against G. Britain, within a month the following force may be collected here:&#x2014;3 first raies from Cadiz&#x2014;3 seventy-fours fitting here&#x2014;5 French ships; making in all 11 sail of the line. The finances of this country are low. They only wait the arrival of the frigates with treasure to put on a different countenance. I cannot conceive that Spain, even if at war with America, could require so many line of battle ships, for similar orders are given at Cadiz and Carthagena. The time that the Armament will be ready for sea corresponding with that of the French squadron; the 3 first rates fitted at Cadiz to come round here; all tend to shew that they have some united object in view.

The Spanish force at the Carracc as I understood consisted of 2 ships of 74 guns, about half manned, and were fitting it was said merely to be carried round to Ferrol to be laid up; an 80 gun ship was repairing at the Carraccas, and to have a third tier added to her.&#x2014;The above was as nearly as I can recollect the naval force at Cadiz on the 5th Sept. and, as far as my observation and enquiries led, there did not at that lime appear any thing like a naval armament on foot.

<title>[ARMY ESTIMATES.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01023">On the motion of the Secretary at War the house went into a committee of supply, to which were referred the several estimates relative to the army.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01024"><member>The Secretary at War</member><membercontribution> said, it became his duty to call the attention of the house to
<col>248</col>
the different parts of the military establishment of the empire. He was satisfied to, think, that he should not detain the house long. Following the example of those who preceded him in his office, some of whom he was proud to imitate, he should content himself with noticing those in which a variation had taken place in the charge. The principle increase of the charge had occurred in consequence of the addition of 29 rank and file per company. Since the estimate had been formed, however, a reformation had taken place, by which the total' expence had been diminished, by the adoption of a plan for not voting the whole addition for the cavalry, but only eleven men per troop; considering the effective of the cavalry at present and the current amount of the recruits raised, no material alteration would be made in that respect. The next description of force in which a material alteration had taken place was that which was raised in virtue of an act made 2 years ago, the Army of Reserve Act. By this act, 50,000 men were to be raised in the empire, 32,000 of which in England. A division into 16 districts had taken place with this view, each of which was to raise 2000 men. As it was difficult that any fixed standard could prevail among the various modes of recruiting by which this act was carried into execution, it was thought proper to form 16' garrison battalions, into which those who were under a certain size, or a certain age, or otherwise unfit for immediate service, had been incorporated. Those who were under age, who were the principal part of this force, having grown, had volunteered into the line, and by other changes, the whole amount of men in these battalions had been reduced to 1,500 men. It was, therefore, proposed to reduce them to 3 battalions, instead of 16, by which a saving would be made in the charges for officers of 204,288<i>l.</i> There was some alteration in the charges for forces in India, but the expence of these was borne by the company. In the item of general and staff officers, an increase of 73,000<i>l.</i> had been made. This was principally in consequence of the system of brigading the volunteers, and annexing to the. brigades field officers, whose utility in improving their discipline had been fully demonstrated. A considerable reduction had been made in the embodied militia, which it was proposed to vote on the old system of 40,000 men for England, and 18,000 for Ireland, the charge for which would be 3,176,000<i>l.</i> instead of 2,663,000<i>l.</i> In the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0139"/>
<col>249</col>
charge of officers, an increase of 24,739<i>l.</i> had been made in consequence of an additional expence in the commissary general's office; and an increase of 8,000<i>l.</i> in the department of the horse guards. There was an increase in the charge for foreign corps, which arose from the augmentation in the German legion, now to contain 10,000 men, instead of 5,000. In the barrack department the expence was a million less than it had been last year. It was still great, because, in consequence of the menaced invasion, it was necessary always to keep a considerable number of men on the coast; a great part of these could not be lodged without barracks, which were now prepared for 8000 men. The right boa. gent, then proceeded to move the estimates, according to the following abstract, for G. Brit, and Ireland:

<p id="S1V0003P0-01025"><member>Mr. Francis</member><membercontribution> said, that he saw by the estimates there was a charge for 20,145 troops in India. He wished to know whether these were Europeans independent of the troops of the Company. He was desirous also of knowing whether the regiments composing this aggregate number were nearly complete.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01026"><member>The Secetary at War,</member><membercontribution> in reply, said, that the troops were independent of the Company's forces; and that as far as he could understand, the numbers of the regiments were nearly complete.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01027"><member>Mr. Francis</member><membercontribution> contended, that the number of European troops in India could not be much above 8 or 9000.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01028"><member>The Secretary at War</member><membercontribution> declared, that though he could not precisely state their number, he was sure they were far above what the hon. gent, had represented.&#x2014;The motion was then put and agreed to.&#x2014;Upon the resolution respecting officers of the staff,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01029"><member>Col. Carlcraft</member><membercontribution> said, it was not his wish unnecessarily to delay or interrupt the committee, but he could not suffer this item "in the estimate to pass unnoticed. The charge for general officers, he said, was most enormous; and how such a number could be deemed necessary, he was utterly at a loss to account. In England there were, he observed, no less than 136 general officers; in Scotland 17; in Ireland 57; which, with one in Guernsey, and another in Jersey, made the whole number no less than 212; a thing, he said, quite unparalleled in the history of the country, in any age; and the necessity for which, it would have become the right hon. gent, to have explained in a less summary way than he had been pleased to do. With respect to the volunteer force of the country, it was said, that a great number of staff officers were necessary to attend to their discipline; but to his knowledge, those corps for some lime past had been by no means so numerous on their parades, or in the field, as heretofore; and it appeared to him, that a great many more people were employed to attend to those corps that were at all necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01030"><member>The Secretary at War</member><membercontribution> replied, that the hon. gent, enjoyed an opportunity on the present occasion, in combating those items in his estimates from the aid. of a printed estimate, which he would hot have had but for his good nature in acceding to the motion for that purpose on a former night; as this was almost the only instance of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0140"/>
<col>251</col>
such an estimate being brought forward to a committee in the printed form. The hon. gent. complained that the number and expence of general officers was unparalleled in the history of the country. But did he reflect also, that the occasion was unparalleled? that the necessity of keeping up an army of 600,000 men to guard against invasion, was unparalleled? or if it had not been for that volunteer force, which the hon. gent, now seemed to think of so little importance and productive of so much useless expence, the dangers which menaced the country would have burst over our heads, and we should have been involved in all that ruin so happily averted by their patriotic spirit and gallantry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01031"><member>Col. Carlcraft</member><membercontribution> replied, that as long as he had a seat in that house, he should feel it his right and his duty to exact, either from the good nature of the right hon. gent, or any other who might fill his station, or from the authoritative influence of the house, the production of printed estimates; for when so enormous a portion of the public money was to be voted, he thought the house had as good right to examine printed estimates, as upon any other head of public expenditure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01032"><member>Mr. Kinnaird</member><membercontribution> congratulated the house upon the acquisition of a secretary at war, who possessed not only so much good nature as the right hon. gent, but so much of another quality, which he should not name, as to boast of it. However, he himself concurred in opinion with the hon. member who spoke last, that a great deal of unnecessary expence was lavished in the pay of inspecting brigadiers to the volunteer corps; and these, too, were always at variance with the old field officers appointed to superintend those corps; so that it was to be apprehended, their disputes would at length break out into something extremely serious to the public service. Brigadier-.generals might have been wisely appointed in the first instance, but it would be very unwise to continue them when they could be no longer serviceable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01033"><member>Mr. Whitbread</member><membercontribution> was of opinion, that any increase in the staff establishment, with a view to the improvement of the volunteers in discipline, by the appointment of brigadier generals, was wholly unnecessary. From his own experience he could affirm, that no advantage whatever had been derived from such appointments; he therefore thought it imprudent to add, so
<col>252</col>
much to the public expenditure unnecessarily.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01034"><member>The Chanc. of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> stated, as the ground of this particular arrangement, that in the circumstances of the country it might have been necessary to collect a large body of troops to a particular point, and that large bodies of troops could not be marched on such service, without the assistance of brig, generals. Whilst there was such a case to be looked to, it was deemed right not to wait for their appointment till the moment when their services would be necessary, but to make the appointments some time before the occasion would be likely to arrive. As the defence of the country would ultimately depend, in a considerable degree, on the efficiency of the volunteers, he was sure the house would not feel indisposed to agree to any expenditure that was to be directed to that object. From the latest returns that had been received, it appeared, that the volunteers amounted to more than 325,000 effective men. Of that number 240,000 had been inspected, and were reported by the proper officers effective, and fit for immediate service. About 40,000 only remained yet to be in? spected. After such a representation, he was confident the house would not consider the sum of 50,000<i>l.</i> an object to be put in competition with the great object of improving the discipline of that very respectable branch of our defensive force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01035"><member>Mr. Whitbread</member><membercontribution> admitted, that the sum was not very material; but it remained for the right hon. gent. to shew that such an expenditure was necessary, or that it contributed in any degree to promote the discipline of the volunteers. In his opinion, without meaning to derogate from the character of the officers alluded to, the improved discipline of the volunteers was not at all owing to those general. Not one jot of that discipline was he disposed to attribute tp their orders or management. On the contrary, it seemed rather to proceed from the activity of the inspecting officers, who were as competent to forward those returns which were alleged as one cause for the new appointments, as any generals whatever. On the whole, he had much doubt of the propriety of such various appointments for the volunteers as major-generals, brigadier? generals, and inspecting officers. If either of these could, with all its appendages, be dispensed with, it would form a
<image src="S1V0003P0I0141"/>
<col>253</col>
saving of expence that ought immediately to be attended to. For the purpose of volunteer discipline, he repeated, that those general officers were unnecessary; and for the purpose of returns, the inspecting officers would fully answer. The original appointment of such a number of generals arose, he was aware, from a blunder committed in the very outset of the volunteer system. From this blunder, a confusion was likely to arise in case the volunteers were called into action, upon the score of rank among the volunteer officers, and also in consequence of the incapacity of those officers to direct the Operation of a body of troops. To guard against such an effect, the appointment of some regular general officers to command the volunteers, but not by any means such a number as appeared in the estimate on the table, became advisable. The ex-pence incurred by this increased number, he admitted, was small, if the purpose for which the increase took place was great; but for such purposes as those described by the right hon. gent, it was much more than ought to arise. Upon this subject lie thought that explanation more satisfactory ought to be given than the house had yet heard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01036"><member>Col. Calcraft</member><membercontribution> compared the estimate of last year with that now under consideration, and asserted that his original statement was correct; that in the sum proposed to be voted, there was an increase beyond the vote of last year, of 134,0001. He referred to the two estimates for the proof of this difference, notwithstanding the positive assertion of the right hon. secretary at war.&#x2014;The motion was agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01037"><member>The Secretary at War</member><membercontribution> then moved, that the sum of 2,663,751<i>l.</i> should be voted for the pay, &amp;c. of the embodied militia of G. Brit, and Ireland, for the present year.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01038"><member>Col. Carlcraft</member><membercontribution> said, that although the right hon. gent. had stated, in his opening, that it was intended to reduce the militia, yet the vote proposed was for the provision of the present establishment. He wished, therefore, to know whether any reduction of the militia was intended immediately to take place?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01039"><member>The Chanc. of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> took this opportunity of stating, that it was in the contemplation of his maj.'s govt. to bring forward, without delay, a plan for more speedily transferring to the regular army a
<col>254</col>
certain proportion of the militia. The various reasons which rendered, this measure advisable, would be stated when, it should be submitted to the consideration of the house; but the right hon. gent. thought, that the known disposition of the men to enter into the regular army particularly recommended its adoption, independently of the policy which obviously suggested itself, of bringing down the militia, with all convenient expedition, to the standard at which, according to the act of last session, it was in future to he fixed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01040"><member>Mr. Johnstone</member><membercontribution> observed, that whether the proportion of the militia alluded to. should remain attached to that body, or be transferred to the regular army, an additional allowance it seemed would be necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01041"><member>The Chanc. of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, that in the vote for the regular army, the regiments were placed so high, that even should the proposed transfer of the militia immediately take place, their establishments would still be incomplete; therefore there would be no necessity for any additional allowance such as the hon. gent. referred to.&#x2014;The motion was agreed to.&#x2014;Upon the proposition for allowance to innkeepers being submitted,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01042"><member>Mr. Fuller</member><membercontribution> took occasion to remark on the extraordinary expence to which the county he had the honour to represent, and the other counties on the coast, were subject, by the conveyance of troops, their baggage, &amp;c. It had been observed, that no less than 80,000 men had been for some time back stationed on the coast. The expence of carriage, &amp;c. in forwarding those troops, was paid by govt. but back carriage fell upon the counties. This had produced so severe a grievance, that the hon. member stated it to be the subject of general complaint. This was an evil which he trusted some means would be taken to remedy. He hoped that, in bringing forward the army extraordinaries, the right hon. the secretary at war would propose something as a reimbursement to those counties for what they had already spent, and as an indemnity for the future. The house would, he had no doubt, acknowledge the justice of such a proposition. The conveyance of troops for the national defence was a national concern, and no undue proportion of the expence attending such conveyance should be' suffered to fall upon particular counties.</membercontribution></p>

<col>255</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01043"><member>The Secretary at War</member><membercontribution> said, that if the ion. member would confer with him in private upon the subject he alluded to, he should be happy to pay him every attention in his power, and if the proposition he recommended should be found advisable, to promote its adoption. If, how-ever, the conversation should produce in his mind a contrary impression, it would still be open to the hon. member to bring forward a motion on the subject himself.&#x2014; Upon the vote for the barracks being proposed,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01044"><member>Mr. Kinnaird,</member><membercontribution> adverting to the temporary barracks erected on the coast, stated, that he understood them to be very unfit for the residence of the troops. He therefore wished to know whether it was meant to continue the use of those barracks, and whether, among the provision far bar-jacks, those were included? If so, he should certainly object to them; and if no specific account of the expence of those barracks was before the house, he should move for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01045"><member>The Secretary at War</member><membercontribution> said, that the barracks alluded to were constructed for the accommodation of the troops, because, from circumstances, no better could be provided. It was advisable that the troops should remain on the coast during winter, and from June till Nov. there was not time sufficient for the building any other than those temporary barracks.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01046"><member>Mr. Kinnaird</member><membercontribution> expressed his sorrow for the expence incurred hi the construction of such barracks; but that expence was by no means so much the object of his consideration, as the danger likely to result to the soldiery from a residence in such places. If those barracks were not to continue any longer in use, he would not so much complain; but if the contrary was intended, he should certainly object to it.</membercontribution></p>

The aggregate of the estimates for the present year exceeded the amount for the last year by 798,000<i>l.</i> but the committee would not consider the estimate for the present year too high, when it looked to the extent of the force proposed to be maintained, and to the circumstances of the country.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01048"><member>Earl Spencer</member><membercontribution> said, that in the absence of his noble friend, (lord Grenville) it fell to his lot to put the motions of which the noble lord had given notice, and the tendency and nature of which he had yesterday explained. The first of these was for the production of the result forwarded to govt. by Mr. Frere, of the information which he intimates in his letter of the 5th of March, 1804, it was his intention to take the first opportunity of requiring from M. Cevallos, relative to the treaty between France and Spain, on finding that the prince of peace did not chose to give him any information on that subject, but referred him to M. Cevallos.&#x2014;After some explanation between lords Mulgrave and Darnley,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01049"><member>Lord Mulgrave</member><membercontribution> said, that after every inquiry which it was in his power to make, and after perusing all the papers on the subject, which were to be found at the foreign office, he could only say, that the existence of any such communication as that alluded to, was altogether unknown to him; nor was he aware that govt. had ever been in possession of the result of such communication, farther than was to be collected from an allusion to the subject in No. 14. of the second volume of papers before the house, (see p. 183.)&#x2014;On this assurance the motion was allowed to drop.&#x2014;The second motion was for production of two notes from M. Cevallos to Mr. Frere, of the 23d and 24th Feb. referred
<image src="S1V0003P0I0143"/>
<col>257</col>
to in M. d'Anduaga's Letter to Lord Hawkesbury, of 30th March, 1304.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01050"><member>Lord Mulgrave</member><membercontribution> said, that no such notes existed, if they could not, as he believed they did, be supposed to apply two notes of date 23d and 24th Jan. the former of which was among the papers on the table, and the latter had not been produced merely because it entirely regarded another subject, the island of Teneriffe, not now in question.&#x2014;This explanation being esteemed satisfactory, this motion was also withdrawn.&#x2014;Several other motions followed, for production of answers by lord Hawkesbury, to the letters from M. d'Auduaga, of the 9th and 30th March, 1st May, 23d Dec. 1804; to all of which it being answered, that no such papers existed, or in the nature of the communication were to be expected, the motions were withdrawn.&#x2014;The next motion was for the production of an account or minute of the communications and explanations made by M. d'Auduaga to lord Harrowby, as to the preparations making at Ferrol, which the former of those gentlemen represents in his letter, as being such as either were, or ought to have beet), satisfactory on that head.&#x2014;This motion was agreed to.&#x2014;The last motion was, for the production of the instructions sent by this govt. to Mr. Frere, at Madrid, authorizing his declaration to the Spanish govt. that if the condemnation of Brit, prizes in the ports of Spain was not put a stop to, he should consider the refusal as a termination to his mission at Madrid,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01051"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> said, that, from being himself in the foreign office at the time, he thought he was warranted in stating, that no instructions of that kind had ever been sent to Mr. Frere, farther than the general instructions contained in the papers on the table of the house. How far Mr. Frere might have thought that they warranted the declaration alluded to, he could not take upon him to say.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01052"><member>Earl Spencer</member><membercontribution> begged it to be understood, that the declarations made by ministers this night, as to their belief of the non-existence of the papers called for, which had been denied to exist, and the motions for production of which had been withdrawn, should be afterwards taken as evidence, that those papers did not exist.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01053"><member>Earl Carlisle</member><membercontribution> said, from what he could understand, it must be held that Mr. Frere had added another to the instructions transmitted to him by govt. which should
<col>258</col>
be esteemed sufficient to put an end to the peace between the two countries, and that he had thus, of his own accord, and without any instructions to that effect, involved Spain and this country in war.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01054"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> said, he had not given, nor meant to give any such opinion, he had only conjectured that such might have been the conclusions drawn by Mr. Frere, from the instructions he had received, and from the tenor of the treaty between the two countries, by which it was declared that Brit. ships should enjoy all the privileges of the most favoured nation. How, far Mr. Frere, if he had judged in this manner, had argued logically, he was not at present called on, or entitled to judge.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01055"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> could not conceive that the words of the instructions, which he read, would warrant any man in drawing from them the result deduced by Mr. Frere.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[IRISH LOANS IN ENGLAND.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01064"><member>Lord Archibald Hamilton,</member><membercontribution> pursuant to his notice on a former day, rose, for the purpose of submitting to the house certain motions on the subject of the financial situation of Ireland. As he understood from a communication with the right hon. gent, opposite (Mr. Foster), that no objection would be made to the production of the papers for which he proposed to move, it would not be necessary for him to trespass long on the attention of the house. He should, therefore, barely state to the house the nature of the motions which it was his intention to propose; first, with respect to the amount of all sums that had been drawn from this country, by way of loans, for the service of Ireland; and next for an account of all orders from the lords of the treasury in Ireland on that subject. But, as in all probability, he should feel himself hereafter bound to call the attention of the house to that subject, he trusted he should meet with their indulgence in stating briefly his own view of it. The house would recollect, that, in consideration of the extraordinary state of the exchange with Ireland, a committee had been appointed during last session, to inquire into and report upon the causes that had produced it. The committee had occupied much time in the consideration of the subject, and the only result that had followed was the measure of drawing on England for the amount of the sums borrowed here at par. This he was so far from considering as a step towards the improvement of the state of exchange, or a removal of the grievance complained of, that be considered it only
<col>260</col>
to operate as a bounty to the merchants in whose favour the bills were drawn. He should therefore feel it his duty on some future day, to call the attention of the house to the subject, at present confining himself to moving, 1st, "That there be laid before this house, an account of all sums borrowed in England for the service of Ireland, together with the interest thereon, and the charges of management, distinguishing the sums raised in each year; 2d, An account of the notes of the bank of Ireland in circulation in 1804, distinguishing those in each quarter, and the notes under the value of 5l.; 3d, An account how the loan raised in G. Brit, for Ireland has been transmitted since Aug. last, distinguishing the dates, the rates of exchange, &amp;c. 4th, A statement of the prices, and fluctuation of the prices of stocks in Ireland, from the 1st of Jan. 1798, to the 1st of Jan. 1805, distinguishing also the dividends payable on the 1st of Jan. 1805." On the question being put on the first motion,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01065"><member>Mr. Foster</member><membercontribution> observed, that the noble lord had done him the honour to communicate to him the substance of the motions which he had just read to the house, to which he could not have any possible objection. But as the noble lord, from the observations he had made, seemed to suppose the lords of the treasury of Ireland to have been actuated by far different motives from those which they felt, he hoped for the permission of the house, to state the motives upon which they had acted. A sum of twelve hundred thousand pounds, or of one million and a half, had remained in England for the service of Ireland, which it was necessary to have transmitted to Ireland. The lords of the treasury applied in the first instance to the bank of Ireland, for this purpose, considering them, as the most proper body to bring the money over. The bank however, refused to interfere, from an apprehension, that as many of the directors were engaged in the business of exchange, any act which would have the effect of constituting them arbitrators of exchange, might draw down upon their court of directors, odium and reprobation. Under such circumstances, the lords of the treasury found themselves under a necessity of resorting to the means of drawing the money, and they adopted the expedient of bringing it over in bank of England notes, or bank post bills. They fixed the amount of the money to be drawn for, and gave ten days or a fortnight's no-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0145"/>
<col>261</col>
tice of the time of drawing for it, in order that all the merchants who might have occasion for the accommodation, should have sufficient previous intimation of it. They fixed the rate of exchange also, in order that such as should be disposed to offer, might be made acquainted with the terms. The sum first required was 200,000<i>l.</i> and the exchange was 11&#x00BD;, the rate of the exchange at the moment; but only 170,000<i>l.</i> were bought. The lords of the treasury, therefore, concluded that they had fixed the exchange at too high a rate, and proposed the next sum, which was also 200,000<i>l.</i> at 10 per cent. exchange; but no more of this sum was taken than in the first instance, namely, 170,000<i>l.</i> They therefore, considered that to secure purchasers for the whole sums wanted, the exchange should be still further lowered, and in consequence they reduced it to par. Their motive in so doing, the house would observe, was not to give any bounty to any particular class of merchants, but to carry into effect the provisions of the legislature. Having said thus much in justification of the Irish treasury, he should add, that he had no sort of objection to any of the noble lord's motions.&#x2014;The motions were then severally put and agreed to.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[REPAIRS OF THE ROMNEY, &amp;c]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01066"><member>Mr. Kinnaird,</member><membercontribution> pursuant to his notice on a former day, rose to move for the production of certain papers, calculated to enable the house to judge of a charge made in a report of the navy board, on the subject of certain very large charges for the repairs of the ships Romney and La Sensible, while under the command of sir Home Popham, in the Red Sea. On a subject of such importance, he thought it incumbent on him, both consistently with his duty to the house, and in fairness to the hon. and gallant officer whose conduct was implicated, to state a few of the circumstances which induced him to institute an inquiry into the grounds of this charge. He hoped the house would do him the justice to believe that he had not taken up the subject on light grounds, or from hasty conclusions. It was not the rumours on this business, which had long met the public ear; it was not till he had, for several months, seen a publication containing the most serious charges against the hon. officer, and observed, that this publication remained unanswered, that he had felt himself called upon no longer to postpone the consideration of a subject, in which, not only the
<col>262</col>
character of the Brit, navy, but the whole system of economy in the public expenditure, were intimately involved. Indeed, it was the less necessary for him to offer any apology on the present occasion, for while he was confident the house would never shew themselves deficient in a desire to uphold the honour of our brave defenders, they would evince a determination not less firm, that no officer, however high his character, or extensive his merits, should be suffered to waste the public money intrusted to his care, with unnecessary and ruinous prodigality. The house had shewn a disposition to act on such principles, in the appointment of the commission to inquire into naval abuses, and, he trusted, the same ideas would continue to regulate their deliberations. It would, surely, not be disputed that the whole duty of a British officer was not confined to his mere conduct in the hour of battle. He would never forget that he had other, and not less important offices to perform, in watching over the distribution of the national resources committed to his care, and that all accounts were to be passed from the validity of his assurances that no idle or unnecessary expenditure had occurred. Having made these general observations, the hon. gent. proceeded to the immediate subject on which he had risen to address the house. It would be recollected, that about the end of the year 1800, the Romney and La Sensible were fitted out for the purpose of co-operating in the expedition to Egypt, which took place in the spring of the subsequent year, and were then under the command of sir Home Popham. About May 1803, as nearly as he could recollect, these ships returned to this country. Previous to this period, bills from India had reached the admiralty, to the amount of no less than-80,000<i>l.</i> for the repair of these vessels. The admiralty board were naturally astonished at so enormous a charge, and they accordingly instructed the commissioners of the navy board to examine into all the stores and repairs which these vessels had received fom the time of their departure from England, and to call for the several journals in, which accounts of the expenditure had been preserved. On the tone and character of the report made by these commissioners, he had been principally inclined to rest his arguments to the house for the production of the papers, with motions for which he meant to conclude. At the time the Rom-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0146"/>
<col>263</col>
ney sailed, she was stated to be completely provided with stores, of all sorts, for 12 months. Yet, as soon as she reached the Cape of Good Hope, which was before the expiration of 3 months, it was found that fresh supplies of stores were obtained; and, in the course of the months of Nov. and Dec. other supplies, to the amount of 4,000<i>l.</i> were charged to the public. This was, surely, a very extraordinary charge, but it was one contained in the report of the commissioners of the navy board, and, consequently, worthy of the utmost attention.&#x2014;The next point to which he wished to direct the attention of the house, was the comparative statement of the journal of the captain, and the several other journals, of the expenditure which had come under the inspection of the commissioners. On this part of the subject it was impossible for him to go into any technical details; but it would be sufficient to refer generally to the tone and temper of the report, the language of which clearly imported that the journals were both irregular and in many instances contradictory. In the report it was distinctly stated, that articles for the use of the Romney and La Sensible had been purchased at a most enormous rate, and that other articles, on the contrary, had not been accounted for in a satisfactory manner, or rather had been disposed of at less than the 20th part of their real value. Among the charges was one for a 50-hundred-weight anchor, purchased in the room of one which had been lost in the Indian seas. Here, however, a remarkable circumstance occurred, that when the inquiry was instituted at Sheerness as to the state of the Romney, it was stated that when she sailed from England she had the identical anchor which was found on board after her return. While this was mentioned, it did not at all appear that the other anchor, in room of which the 50-hundred-weight anchor was purchased, had ever been lost, or if it was lost, that it had ever been recovered. Even if all the extra expences were to be admitted, there would remain four or five thousand pounds, for which no sort of account is to be discovered in the journals of the boatswain, or elsewhere. It was asserted that the Romney, when she left England, was fully provided for 12 months with all requisite stores. But after the most minute enquiries, the commissioners had found, that in a very short time after her sailing-she had received repairs, and
<col>264</col>
that nearly 9,000<i>l.</i> had been charged the these repairs; 7,800<i>l.</i> of which they considered as excess of charge, on an accurate examination. Surely in this there was very little of the appearance of economy, and k was fit, at such a period as he present, that the business should be fully investigated. The commissioners had stated the charges to be enormous, and it was proper that the grounds of their decision should be stated. With respect to the charges on the repairs of the Sensible, the same opinion as to extravagance was delivered, and the same necessity for full investigation existed. Whether the hon. officer at the time the supposed repairs were made, was under the orders of adm. Rainier, or whether, as he had heard it insinuated, he had an independent command, he confessed himself unable to decide. If he was under the orders of adm. Rainier, it certainly must be allowed to have been a most extraordinary circumstance, that the superior officer had not been consulted on a step which was surely one of very great consequence, and necessarily attended with vast expence. The step to which he alluded was the changing of the Sensible into a 32 gun frigate. The hon. officer might have had grounds for this alteration, but it could not be pretended that he had communicated his reasons to the adm. on the East India station. On the contrary it appeared, that a month previous to the arrival of the ship at Calcutta, the cordage, rigging, and other articles necessary to form the alteration, had been ordered and were in a state of preparation. Thus, it appeared that the hon. officer had taken the whole responsibility of the business on himself, and it was proper that the grounds on which he proceeded should be explained. It was stated that before the Sensible had been altered, her situation had been fully examined, but what he had just stated respecting the orders for stores, completely refuted this idea. There were other accounts of transactions in the Red Sea which were not a little curious. The hon. officer seemed to have found, contrary to general opinion, every thing quite as convenient for the repair of ships as if he had actually been in the heart of the river, and in the vicinity of our arsenals. It was proper that the public should understand the whole of these transactions, which were necessary to complete the view of the subject. Connected with this part of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0147"/>
<col>265</col>
the question, he should also take the liberty of moving for certain letters from marquis Wellesley relative to the expenditure of the vessels under the command of the hon. officer while in the Indian seas. Before he sat down, he wished to say a few words as to the mode of investigation which he had thought it his duty to propose. It might be asked, whether this was the only possible mode of investigating the subject; whether there was not another tribunal, before which the merits of the question might not be more satisfactorily decided? It might be urged that this was a matter which the board of admiralty were much more competent to try, than an assembly composed as that which he had the honour to address. To this his answer was plain and satisfactory. He had heard, on authority which to him appeared highly respectable, that the late board of admiralty had designed to institute a criminal prosecution against the hon. officer. The change of administration, however, by which the late "weak and inefficient" board of admiralty was changed for a "capable and efficient" one, had prevented them from carrying their views into effect, and there was no prospect of the present board of admiralty following up the resolution of their predecessors. When he saw the hon. officer not only invested with an important command, but apparently high in the confidence of his maj,'s ministers, he thought it was not at all unnatural to suppose, that no sort of proceeding respecting the hon. officer's conduct was in contemplation. It might be said again, that this subject would, with much more propriety, have been submitted to the consideration of the commission appointed to inquire into naval abuses. For his part, he should have felt pride and satisfaction in having the merits of the question tried before that board. Never, he believed, did any men, invested with great powers, discharge their duly to the house and the public with more zeal, and more fidelity. But as it was understood that this board had it not in their power to take cognizance of the business, he had felt it his duty to submit it to the consideration of the highest tribunal in the country. He lamented deeply the painful nature of the duty he had this night attempted to perform. If the charges which appeared in the report of the late board against the hon. officer could not be supported, he should rejoice in having afforded him an opportunity of establish-
<col>266</col>
ing his character, and refuting ill-founded charges, and public calumny. He should hope, likewise, that the house would do him justice, and give him credit for the integrity of his intention, in arraigning the conduct of the hon. officer, who, if guilty, should be made to feel, that he was employed not only to fight in the cause of his country, but also to be the steward, in his department, of the public purse. The hon. gent, concluded, with moving, "that there be laid before the house; 1, An account of the repairs of the Romney; 2, A copy of the report of the navy board, of the 20th Feb. 1804, respecting the repairs of the Romney and Sensible, and the expenditure and supplying of stores on board of those ships while under the command of sir Home Popham, together with its enclosures; 3, Copies of the letters of marquis Wellesley, respecting the above accounts, transmitted to the directors of the East India Company." As soon as the first motion was put from the chair,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01067"><member>Sir Home Popham</member><membercontribution> rose, and assured the house, that no man in existence was more anxious than himself to have every pant of his conduct fully canvassed; no exertion had been omitted on his part to have a fair opportunity of vindicating himself from the charges which were so industriously circulated against him in an anonymous and scurrilous pamphlet, from which the hon. gent. who introduced the business, appeared to have drawn all his information. The hon. member had expressed his surprise, that no answer had been given to that pamphlet. He begged leave to assure the hon. gent. and the house, that this had arisen from no backwardness on his part, to meet the scandalous falsehoods which that pamphlet contained. The fact, however, was, that a certain degree of caution and alarm in the press had retarded the publication of his answer; which now, however, was before the public. From this answer, he begged leave to read a few extracts of letters which had passed between him and the board of admiralty, from which it would be clear beyond all possibility of doubt, that he had on every occasion evinced the most ardent desire, not only to throw no obstacles in the way of the investigation of the charges; but had, on the contrary, pressed upon the board of admiralty, every consideration which seemed to him in the least calculated to accelerate the discussion. In support of this observation, the hon. offi-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0148"/>
<col>267</col>
cer proceeded to read an extract from a letter to Lord St. Vincent, as first lord of the admiralty, in June, 1803, in which he alludes to the gross and unfounded charges made against him, and solicits their lordships to lose no time in ordering a strict investigation of his conduct. To this letter he received an answer, that the business should be referred to the commissioners of the navy board, and as soon as they had prepared a report on the subject, a copy should be furnished him. The hon. officer, still anxious to accelerate the investigation, wrote, on the 5th July, another letter, representing the propriety of his being called before the navy board, to afford such explanations as would materially facilitate a final decision. The whole of his correspondence with the admiralty had, he maintained, this dispatch in the investigation as the object dearest to his heart. It could not be at all contended, therefore, that if the matter was not fully investigated, any blame was to be attached to him in the business. Indeed, from a review of the whole of his conduct, he had no reason to shrink from enquiry. He was confident, that on every occasion, and during the whole of the service on which the charge was founded, he had never looked to private interest, but to the interest and the glory of his country. He had ample testimonies of the discipline, the healthiness, and the sailor-like apperance of the crew of the Romney while under his command, and he consoled himself, amidst malignant and unfounded charges, by the reflection that he had been fortunate enough to receive the good opinion of the most respectable men in the honorable profession to which he belonged. He was never conscious of having given an order for a single article which did not seem to him necessary to the public service. On the 26th of July, he wrote to sir Evan Nepean, in consequence of the laying his papers before the commissioners, repeating his solicitations to give his personal attendance on the enquiries, as the most expeditious mode possible for the object in view, and the only way of accelerating a decision. To this he received no answer: and, oh the 3d of Aug. he wrote to the navy board on the same subject, and requesting to have the question put, which he had put at Chatham: "Whether, if the Romney had not received the repairs in question, considering the weather she experienced, she would not, in all probability, have
<col>268</col>
gone to the bottom?"&#x2014;The hon. officer then observed, that his ship was in such a state, that a few days after his pennant was down, it was commissioned&#x2014;an unprecedented occurrence. The hon. bart then explained what had passed at Calcutta, in the repairs of the different vessels under his command, none of which had been adverted to by the hon. gent. except the Romney, nor by the anonymous publication from which he had taken all his information. Here he could not omit to notice, that the anonymous publication had made no slight impression on certain gallant officers in the navy. In proof of this, the hon. bart. read an affidavit that had been volutarily made by a gent. who had been out with him as 3d, then as 2d lieut. and had afterwards been made commander by Lord St. Vincent. The gent. he adverted to was Francis Mason, Esq. commander of his maj.'s ship Rattler; and as that gent. was indebted wholly for his promotion to Lord St. Vincent, his voluntary and unsolicited testimony would have some weight with the house. The affidavit had been made before the mayor of Portsmouth on the 5th of Jan. 1805, subsequent to the appearance of the pamphlet, but before the notice of the hon. gent.'s motion. The tenor of the affidavit was highly complimentary to the hon. bart. It stated "that he saw no undue waste of stores; that the conduct of sir Home Popham was that of a strict disciplinarian, and that he was incapable of doing any thing contrary to honour and integrity, and the good of the service; that his attention to the sick was exemplary; that they had in the Red Sea only one scorbutic, and one liver case; that the country boats were absolutely necessary, and that by them they saved the lives of 400 persons, soldiers and sailors, in the Red Sea; that a cable was cut in Balasore Road, at the recommendation of the pilot, in order to enter Diamond Harbour, with several other particulars, highly to the credit and honour of the character of sir Home Popham." Similar testimony in his favour the hon. officer read from the letter of a respectable gent. in India, in which he attributes the safety of the Calcutta transport in the Red Sea, to the exertions of sir Home Popham, his officers and crew.&#x2014;He insisted on the circumstance of no attempt being made to bring him to punishment, as a strong proof of his innocence. If the board of admiralty thought they had a case
<image src="S1V0003P0I0149"/>
<col>269</col>
made out against him, why did they not bring him to a court martial? That they were not unwilling to do so, can scarcely be denied; and their having taken no steps in the business, was a pretty good proof that they were convinced that any attempt to substantiate any charge against him would prove abortive. No less than IS months after his return elapsed before any report was formed, and now that the report was before the public nearly a year, no steps had been taken to follow up the charges. He was happy that the subject was now brought forward, and he trusted there would not be a dissenting voice in agreeing to the production of all the papers for which the hon. gent. had moved. He was anxious to have no information held back, and he was highly gratified to think that he should now have an opportunity of vindicating his conduct before so high a tribunal. Before he sat down, the hon. officer animadverted on the last sentence of the report of the commissioners of the navy board. It was there admitted by the commissioners that they had conducted the investigation in an unusual manner, that they had framed their report without hearing sir Home Popham as to any of the grounds of charge, but that in following this course they thought they acted in conformity to the wishes of the lords commissioners of the admiralty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01068"><member>Admiral Markham</member><membercontribution> stated, that the board of admiralty had directed the navy board to furnish the hon. officer with a copy of their report, and that he believed it was furnished. It was natural to suppose that when such heavy accusations were brought forward against the hon. officer, he would have entered into some justification of his conduct. The hon. officer had hinted that he ought to have been called before the navy board for that purpose. Such was not the regular mode of procedure. The accounts of all naval officers are sent to the navy board, there examined, and, if found to be incorrect, the pay of such officers is stopped, but they are not themselves summoned to give an explanation of their conduct. The hon. officer had expressed his surprise, that after his return to England, and during the period in which the late admiralty board continued in office, this report had been suffered to lie dormant, and no proceedings whatever instituted upon it. He would inform the house of the reason. In the first instance, the admiralty conceived the idea of instituting a criminal prosecution; they then
<col>270</col>
doubted their power to do this, and determined to refer it to the court of exchequer. That the affair might be fully investigated, various reports were waited for, which had not been received when the late admiralty went out of office. An hon. gent, whom he had in his eye, (Mr. Dickenson, jun.) could probably inform the house, whether these reports had yet arrived. If they had, he took it for granted that the proceedings would be continued. The hon. officer had spoken confidently of his ability to justify himself. He could only tell him, that he believed that the board of admiralty could have justified itself much more readily; yet he would say, that if the hon. officer should be able to justify himself to the satisfaction of the house, and of the country, it would afford him very great pleasure. As to what had been said of the "scurrility" of a certain pamphlet, it was most certain that he had read the pamphlet; but there did not appear to him all that scurrility which was imputed to it. Nay, what was called scurrilous, was, in point of fact, nothing but the report of the navy board. He had read that report; and, undoubtedly, it so reflected upon the hon. officer, that it was his duty to do away the effect of it if he could.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01069"><member>Mr. Dickenson,</member><membercontribution> jun. said, he was not prepared to answer the last speaker's question, with regard to the receipt of any additional reports relative to the hon. officer's conduct. It appeared to him that the navy board had acted against all precedent and decorum in the case of sir Home Pop-ham. As far as he could call to his recoil lection the last passage of their report, its tendency was, that they had declined hearing sir Home Popham's defence, and had proceeded on <i>ex parte</i> evidence to please the then board of admiralty. He would not anticipate the hon. officer's defence, this was not the time to allege any circumstances in his justification. The present board of admiralty had not referred the affair to a court martial, because the time allowed by law on such occasions had expired; they had not brought it before any judicial court, because the evidence, on which alone their accusations could be founded, was only <i>ex parte</i> evidence. His feelings prompted him to say a great deal on this subject; he should, however, confine himself to a few words. The affair, in all its circumstances, had, for some, time, been under his most serious consideration; and he was happy to congratulate that gallant officer, and with him, the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0150"/>
<col>271</col>
service, that house, and the whole country, on the assurance, that his defence would not rest merely on statements of general character, but that he would be enabled to confute his accusers by undeniable proofs of innocence, and by opposing fact to fact.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01070"><member>The Chanc. of the Excheq.</member><membercontribution> said, it was far from being his intention to enter much into this subject, and he had expected that the hon. gent. would have abstained from general observation, which tended only to aggravate, whilst the officer, the object of the discussion, had professed his extreme desire to enter into the investigation of his conduct; and for a full disclosure of facts, by the production of every information. He concurred with what an hon. friend of his, a member of the present admiralty board, had said, relating to the last sentence of the report of the navy board; and must think the case was decided by that board on <i>ex parte</i> evidence. But what he most of all wished at that moment was, that gent, would, in candour and fairness, forego the investigation of a subject, the necessary evidence on which they had not before them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01071"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> said, he did not mean to go into any discussion on the present occasion. He could not, however, admit that the light hon. gent. who had just sat down was entitled to blame the hon. gent. for the manner in which he had introduced the subject. The hon. member had introduced no observations but such as were strictly connected with the object he had in view. His object was to persuade the house of the propriety of having the papers produced; and was it not for that purpose necessary to employ some arguments? When papers were called for, was it not always previously required that a case should be made out to the house? But the right. hon. gent. had argued that there was no necessity for argument, because the hon. officer did not, oppose the production of the papers. He felt himself called upon to protest against such doccrine. It was not parliamentary, and he trusted it would never be admitted by the house. It was not fit that the house should hear of the production of papers merely because it happened to suit the inclination of the parties. He was not displeased that the hon. officer had shewn himself willing to go into the enquiry; yet, perhaps, if he had not talked so much of his own innocence, and of the guilt of the late board, it would not have been the
<col>272</col>
worse for his cause. What most surprised him, however, was the observation of the right hon. gent.; for when himself, and other friends of his, have moved for papers for the defence of their very nearest relations, the right hon. gent. has told them, that they must first make out a case, and next he has got his own friends to move, the previous question; so debarring them of information. This subject was altogether very well worthy the attention of the bouse1 and the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01072"><member>The Chanc. of the Excheq.</member><membercontribution> allowed the truth of part of the hon. gent.'s observations, but added, that when it was understood, as it certainly had been, that no opposition to the motion was intended, it certainly became less necessary to enter into particulars, much less into an aggravated statement of them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01073"><member>Mr. Kinnaird,</member><membercontribution> confirmed as he was in his own opinion by that of his hon. friend, did not deem it necessary to make any apology to the house for what he had said, He had merely stated what was contained in the report of the navy board; if it were proved false, no man would more willingly retract. With regard to the statement, that the navy board had adopted an unusual mode of proceeding in this affair, it was untrue. The same had taken place when that board had investigated the conduct of sir R. King, sir A. Mitchell, sir R. Bicker-ton, and capt. Cook, of the ship La Forte, It would afford him the sincerest satisfaction, could the hon. officer clear himself in the eyes of his country from the imputation which attached to him, and in that case he should be one of the first to avow his misapprehension.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01074"><member>Sir Home Popham</member><membercontribution> was surprised, as the hon. gent, was not pushed for precedents, that he should allude to an officer who had lost his life in the service of his country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01075"><member>The Chanc. of the Excheq.</member><membercontribution> was persuaded, that with the sentiments which he was sure the hon. gent, possessed, it must have been through inadvertence that he had selected, as one of his precedents, the officer alluded to. It was due to the memory of that officer to have spared the feelings of those who admired him, and of a country grateful for his valour and services. Had he lived, he would have proved an invaluable ornament to that profession in which, few has had been his days, he had shone.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01076"><member>Mr. Kinnaird</member><membercontribution> said, that he would not be schooled by any man in that house into sentiments of delicacy. He had alluded.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0151"/>
<col>273</col>
to the case of a gallant officer; but both without having aspersed, or meaning to asperse his memory.&#x2014;The hon. gent's, motions were then put and agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01077"><member>Sir Home Popham</member><membercontribution> then rose, and stated, that wishing nothing to he withheld, he felt it is duty to move to have laid before the house, all his correspondence with the board of admiralty and the navy board. He accordingly referred to the greater part of their letters, in all of which he expressed the strongest desire for the fullest investigation of his conduct. He complained severely of the reluctance of the navy board to give him up the papers necessary for completing his defence, even after he had received assurances from the secretary of the admiralty that orders for that purpose had been specially delivered. He had been informed in April that the papers were nearly ready for delivery. He had made repeated applications, till Aug. when he was given to understand that the papers were lost. Thus, after waiting 4 or 5 months, he had been scandalously tantalized and disappointed. He inveighed with great severity on such unfair and illiberal treatment of the report. As an instance of the jealousy, or worse, of the late admiralty, the hon. officer next stated to the house, that when at Sheerness, for the purpose of refitting, every delay had been interposed, and the most vexatious obstacles thrown in his way, until at length the object was in danger of never being accomplished, &#x2014;There was another subject on which he felt peculiar pain. It was not enough to have traduced him in a pamphlet, in which hot one fact appeared that was not scandalously perverted, but that pamphlet must be circulated with an industry unparalleled, and even sent to the officers under his command: for when on a late service on the enemy's coast, he found that that pamphlet had been sent by post to the officers under his command. On a proceeding like this, which obviously tended to remove all confidence in a commander, he need make no observations. Was it patriotism? Was it public virtue? Ridicule, too, was at the same time attempted to be thrown upon him, because he had been, as his enemies had pleased to term it, a leader of catamarans, a mode of attack, which in common with other officers, he had suggested to the present naval administration. He begged leave to remark on the way in which the notice for the motion now before the house had been given. He was in command of a
<col>274</col>
ship now at Gravesend; it was occasionally necessary for him to go down to that place; and a day on which he was absent was selected for the purpose of giving the notice. It would, perhaps, have been at least as civil had he been made previously acquainted with the intention of the hon. gent. The hon. officer concluded with moving, for the whole of the correspondence which passed between him and the two boards on the charges against him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01078"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> declared, that had it not been for what had fallen from the hon. officer, he should not have said a single word more upon the subject. That hon. officer had said that the board adopted a particular mode of proceeding, because they thought that it would be agreeable to the admiralty. On the 9th of April, he said, he had been promised to be furnished with the papers he required. That board was only three weeks longer in existence; it was therefore impossible that he could have been supplied by them with a copy of the papers in Aug. the time to which he had alluded. As to the idea of officers being ready to meet enquiry, or, in fact, being anxious for it, it had been seen, in that house, that when such persons, or the nearest relatives of them had supported, or voted for the inquiry, there were other persons, (members of his maj.'s govt.) who openly resisted the investigation, and the necessary papers were not produced. A right hon. gent. who professed himself at that time, to be as anxious as any other member of that house to promote the inquiry, had since come into office; and from the superiority of information which his situation afforded, he should have expected that the right hon. gent. would have brought the subject again. before parliament. He, however, had not thought fit so to do.

subjects as he did, yet he entertained an unabated respect for the public services of the noble lord. However, he thought it a little too hard to hear it said, that he had changed his opinion, because he had not exhibited motions against the late naval administration of this country. As to his opinion of that administration, he begged that he might be distinctly understood. Every opinion he had entertained of it when out of office, had been confirmed by every thing he had seen, or read, or heard, since his being in office. Yet the. hon. gent. (Mr. Fox) betrayed his inconsistency a little, in accusing him of negligence of his duty, in regard to his forbearance towards the late admiralty; whereas the hon. gent., had his recollection not failed him, might have remembered a period when the doctrine of retrospect would not have proved very favourable to him.</membercontribution></p>

<col>276</col>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01089"><member>The Chanc. of the Excheq.</member><membercontribution> now rose to move for the discharge of the order. There was nothing, he said, to induce trite house to wish to hear evidence at its bar. The question had already undergone the fullest discussion. The house had the judgment of a select committee, the attention and the powers of which were peculiarly directed to this subject. Such was the case previous to the act called the Grenville Act. How did it stand now? The house had the advantages of the resolutions resulting on the enquiries of those who were sworn to fulfil the solemn duty to which they were appointed. What was now to be required? The persons, to be examined were either to-repeat their former testimony, or they were not. If they correctly stated their evidence as before given, there would be no advantage derived from the re-examination proposed; if they varied in their depositions, was the, house to give the preference to their former declarations on oath, or to their subsequent affirmations? Certainly it must be admitted, that the testimony which had received the authority and sanction of an appeal of that nature, ought to be preferred. On these grounds he should move, that. The order be discharged.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0003P0I0153"/>
<col>277</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01090"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> said, he felt it impossible to concur in the. grounds stated for the proposition of the right hon. gent, and equally impossible to accede to the <i>res integra</i> of the proceedings he recommended. A great deal of additional difficulty appeared to him to be thrown in the way of such concurrence by this consideration, that the house had already made an order that the parties accused should be heard at the bar. This order had been announced to those parties, in consequence of which they were in attendance, and prepared, no doubt, to produce farther evidence, perhaps of some persons who were out of the way, or were not known when the case was under the investigation of the committee. By such farther examination of evidence, the parties might expect to be able to lay before the house a more favourable view of their cause. After such an order, and such probable preparation in consequence, it appeared to him that it would be highly unjust to make a new order at the present moment. It would be, in fact, to say to the parties, "although we have made an order that you should be heard at the bar to-day; although you may have taken great trouble to collect evidence to throw new light upon your case, and to repel the charges against, you, yet we have changed our mind, and you cannot be heard; we mean to re-consider the subject." Such would be the language of the house to the accused, should the proposition of the rt. hon. gent. be adopted. The practice referred to by the right hon. gent, which prevailed before the enactment of the Grenville bill, was not, he contended, analogous to the case under consideration, or to any case under that bill; for, in the former instance, it was to be recollected, that the committees upon election petitions were, though nominally select committees, accessible to all the members of the house; and therefore, every member might attend to examine and cross-examine the evidence. Of course, the report of such committees must be different, in the estimation of the house, from those of the committees under the Grenville act, which consisted but of a few members. In the one case, all the members of the house were competent to attend and investigate any part of the subject, while, in the other, only a few select persons were permitted to do so. This difference he the more dwelt on, in order to shew, that from the change which
<col>278</col>
had taken place in the jurisdiction upon election cases, the course formerly pursued was not fairly applicable at present. The right hon. gent, had endeavoured to support his proposition by resorting to the popular argument, which, in his opinion, could make no impression upon any candid, rational man; namely, that because the witnesses would not be on Oath at the bar, although they were so before the committee, that therefore we should have no examination of evidence whatever before the house. The question for consideration, was not whether the committee was more competent to investigate a charge against individuals, and to ascertain their guilt or innocence. Perhaps the court of King's Bench was still more competent to such an investigation. But that was not the point before the house. The question was this, whether, when executing the office of a criminal judicature, the house would act according to its own constitution, or to the principles of equity, if it proceeded to pronounce judgment without any examination of evidence as to the nature of the case upon which it was called on to judge? In declaring a negative to this question, he had little doubt of being supported by a full consideration of the practice of the house, and by the opinion of dispassionate men. The Grenville act, whatever other persons might think of it, or however it might be considered in other respects, had created an anomaly in the constitution of that house. By the course followed antecedent to that act, the whole matter of the election, as well with respect to the seat as to the conduct of the returning officers, and all collateral points, were referred to the committee; and the ultimate decision upon all these points still remained with the house, the report of the committee serving to guide its judgment. But, under the new arrangement, did the house commit to the committee the whole matter of the case? No; that committee was the dernier resort as to the seat only. Upon that their decision was, according to a legislative act, final and conclusive. But the seat was the only thing upon which the report of such committee was unalterable. As to any special report which it was authorized to make relative to the conduct of the returning officers,' the house retained the full power which, according to precedent, was uniformly; exercised, to proceed upon such special
<image src="S1V0003P0I0154"/>
<col>279</col>
report in the way which it was the object of the right hon. gent.'s motion to reverse. The Grenville act made as clear o distinction between the power vested in the committee, as to the decision of the seat, and that relative to a special report, as words could express. In the one case their power was absolute; in the other, it belonged to them only to report that there were other circumstances connected with the election, which required the interference of the house. Considering the report before the house in that view, he could not admit that it should have any other influence than that of calling attention to the proceedings of the accused, but by no means that of forming the ground for their conviction or punishment. All the precedents, since the Grenville act, upon similar cases, justified this opinion. But the right hon. gent, who proposed another course, thought proper entirely to overlook those precedents, and to look to the conduct formerly pursued under circumstances which he contended were not at all analogous. If the report of a committee under the new jurisdiction were to be binding on the house to adopt, in what a dilemma would the house be placed, suppose that an election committee on the Shoreham case, or that of Nottingham, had, in addition to the other particulars in their report, resolved that the right of election ought to be thrown open, that the electors should be increased. Would not the admission of such an authority, in the report of a committee, as he had alluded to, be, in effect, to delegate to such committee the legislative power of the house? Yet, such an inference would naturally follow from the arguments used by the right hon. gent. If, then, that argument, or the proposition that followed, could not be sustained by reason, the constitution of the house, or precedent, he thought that justice would urge the adoption of such line of proceeding as might be most favourable to the interest of the accused, and that, obviously, was to allow them to bring forward any farther evidence that it might be in their power to produce for their exculpation. Any different course would, he was quite persuaded, be felt as inconsistent with the ends of substantial justice, as it would be with the spirit of our law. That law uniformly said, that a man accused of any offence should be fully heard before sentence should be pro-
<col>280</col>
nounced; and that law very properly allowed, that if any circumstances could be discovered, to alter the nature of the charge, and to establish the innocence of the accused up to the moment before the time fixed for the infliction of punishment, the sentence should be reversed. Here, however, it was proposed to deviate entirely from that laudable and salutary mode of proceeding. Since the investigation of this case before the committee, circumstances had occurred which, without meaning any reflection whatever on the judgment, principles, or character of the gent, who composed that commit: tee, would, he was persuaded, prevent them at the present day from pronouncing as a jury that verdict which appeared in the report on the table. Was it not, then, but fair to allow these circumstances to be laid before the house by evidence at the bar? It would be unjust towards the house, and it would be cruel towards the parties accused, to exclude such evidence. If a criminal were convicted of the most heinous offence, that power in whom the right of pardon is constitutionally vested, would not hesitate even the moment before the appointed execution of sentence, to remit that sentence, and pardon the accused, should any facts arise to prove his innocence. This example should be attended to in the case under consideration, and should urge the house to afford to the accused every opportunity of exculpation, before it attempted to pronounce judgment. This was not only the opinion which he entertained, but that which was sanctioned by all former proceedings in similar cases. In the Shoreham case, which the noble lord chose as the precedent to follow, with one exception only, in this instance, he recollected some debate, and a division also, the result of which was, a determination opposed only by a very small minority, that those accused should be heard fully by evidence, and by counsel at the bar. Such was the mode that justice, law, and precedent suggested to the house on the present occasion; and he felt the character of the house, and of public equity, to be so much concerned, that he could not help resisting the introduction of a different practice. The evidence which appeared in the report might have been taken in a loose way, or it might be imperfect, and a farther examination at the bar might elucidate many, important facts. This was not at all im-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0155"/>
<col>281</col>
possible, notwithstanding the close scrutiny said to have, taken place before the committee, and the known accuracy of the council employed, whose ability no man mole highly respected than he did, and upon even the possibility of such elucidation, he would have the parties allowed a farther hearing. Those parties he bad heard it intimated, were willing to acquiesce in the refusal of any farther examination of evidence; of this he knew nothing positively, but even if it were so, it would effect no change in the opinion he entertained. However, if upon appearing at the bar they admitted the evidence as it stood in the, report, their admission must of course be received; but in no other way-could he notice, that admission, because it was not more his object to render perfect justice to the accused, in this instance, than to guard against the establishment of a precedent that was likely to lead to great injustice towards others.&#x2014;The hon. member concluded, with observing, that under all the circumstances of the case, particularly after having appointed a hearing at the bar on this day, and ordered the attendance of the parties accordingly, it would be one of the harshest proceedings imaginable to reverse that order now, and strike into a new and opposite course.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01091"><member>The Attorney General</member><membercontribution> said, he saw no force in the arguments used by the hon. gen. in opposition to the motion of his right hon. friend, and still less in the observation which the hon. gent, applied to the reversal of the order and course of proceeding at the present moment. It could not be complained that the parties were taken unaware, as when the business had been postponed on a former day, his right hon. friend distinctly stated, that the ground of that postponement was to afford gentlemen an opportunity of considering the' expediency of a deviation from the precedent of the Shoreham case, of the nature of that which was now proposed. That the course proposed by his right hon. friend was strictly according to the uniform practice which prevailed previous to the Grenville act, was not attempted to be denied; and the question for the house to consider in the present instance, and also for future cases, was this, whether it would be more agreeable to justice and expediency to follow the former course, or that which bad obtained since the enactment of the Grenville law? For the former he certainly was an advocate, and his
<col>282</col>
surprize was, that any deviation from it had ever taken place; the more particularly as the Grenville bill prescribed nothing on the subject. As to the objection urged by his right hon. friend against the examination of evidence at the bar, who not being on oath might differ from the allegations made before the committee, the hon. gent, in order, no doubt, to depreciate that objection, had thought pro? per to style it "a popular argument," and certainly the maxim of <i>uox populi,</i> <i>vox dei,</i> was never more applicable than to an argument of such irresistible force. But although this argument was so forcible, he would not go so far as to say that the farther hearing of evidence at the bar, should, be resisted if such resistance should appear to be injurious to the cause of justice, or unfair towards the individuals concerned in the case before the house. There was no pretence, however, for saying that such could be the consequence; on the contrary, it was as fair to argue that the examination of evidence, not on oath at the bar, might be injurious to the accused as otherwise. Witnesses might go beyond their former statements, and might aggravate the case against the accused. Therefore, in any view, the further hearing demanded by the hon. gent. appeared to him quite inadmissible.&#x2014;He observed, upon the hon. gent.'s allusion to analogy, and reasoning as hostile to the course proposed by his right hon. friend, but he had omitted to state any precedent to sustain his statement on the score of analogy. Those precedents indeed which he had it in his power to state, were very few compared to the practice that prevailed so long before the existence of the Grenville bill. The hon. gent. had argued that it would be iniquitous, and contrary to any. precedent of law, to pronounce sentence without hearing evidence upon the case to which such sentence applied: but the hon. gent, must forget that such was the frequent practice in the Court of King's Bench, where sentence was pronounced, upon cases, where1 not one of the four, judges had ever heard the evidence, nor had any other knowledge of it than that which they derived from the notes of the judge who presided at the trial; which, notes, by the way, were not so much, at least not more, intitled to confidence than the minutes of the evidence in the report before the house, which were taken by a sworn short-hand writer. It might be
<image src="S1V0003P0I0156"/>
<col>283</col>
said that the judges pronouncing upon the verdict of a jury constituted a material difference, but it was to be observed, that a committee formed in cases of this sort, with relation to the house, a constitutional tribunal tantamount to a jury. On the ground of analogy stated by the hon. gent. he was satisfied from what he had mentioned, that it was unattainable, and his arguments as to precedent were not less. If a precedent were wrong the hon. gent, himself would, he apprehended, be one of the last to maintain that it ought to be followed. That the case of Shoreham was not felt to be unexceptionable, appeared in the debates and proceedings on the Cricklade case, and in the instance of Great Grimsby alone, had it been followed. Why, then, should such a practice, if contrary to the old course, which he reasserted was not at all changed by the Grenville act, and still more if contrary to the ends of justice, be suffered to go on? It was pretended, in the case before the house, that another hearing should be granted to the parties, because they might have new light to introduce on the subject. If such a suggestion were attended to, it would form an argument for new trials, <i>ad infinitum.</i> The accused bad already been afforded ample opportunities to bring forward any-evidence in exculpation they desired. They had the ablest counsel that could be obtained, to cross-examine the evidence against them and to conduct their defence, therefore he saw no ground whatever, to induce the house to enter into the case again. In the case of Great Grimsby, where the house ordered evidence to the bar, it appeared that the returning officer was not present before the committee who reported against him. Here then there was ground for the order, which constituted a material difference from the matter now before the house. He submitted that a more anomalous course was recommended to the house by the hon. gent, namely, that it should call evidence to its bar for an <i>ex parte</i> examination, for it could be nothing else, as the house must be unable to cross-examine the witnesses, having no particular knowledge of the transactions to which their evidence, was meant to apply, and not being furnished with those suggestions for cross-examination, which the counsel on both sides could have had before the committee. The learned gent, considering that the house had the same relation to the committees
<col>284</col>
under the new jurisdiction that it had to the committees under the old, and that the course proposed by his right hon. friend, was preferable for many reasons, at the same time that it did not bind the house by any means servilely to adopt the resolutions of the committee, unless they were found to be fully justified by the evidence, stated that he should give his support to the motion before the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01092"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> said, he would trespass on the house but for a few words, not that he thought it necessary to vindicate himself from such gross ignorance as he should be ashamed of. The learned gent. had charged him with saying, that it was contrary to all analogy to pronounce sentence without hearing evidence. He said no such thing. He said it was contrary to analogy to pronounce the guilt of a party without hearing evidence. He believed, the hon. gent, would allow there was a material difference in the expresssion, and he was certain the learned judges would perfectly agree with him in the distinction he had taken.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01093"><member>Mr. Sheridan</member><membercontribution> said, he agreed entirely with his hon. friend, whose arguments had been so strong that he did not think it at all necessary to reply to the observations that had been made by the learned gent, on the other side. There was a principle, however, laid down by the learned gent, that if the returning officer should not happen to be present at the committee who might report against his conduct, there would then be ground for hearing such evidence at the bar as such officer might feel it necessary to bring forward for his exculpation. If so, then the course proposed by the learned gent.'s right hon. friend was inadmissible. For it always would be necessary to establish a preliminary inquiry, according to the learned gent.'s principle, to ascertain whether the returning officer was present at the committee before the house proceeded to pronounce judgment upon him; and in point of strict justice, this inquiry should also go to this point, whether the returning officer was present throughout, or whether his defence was not perfected before the committee had made their report. In the case before the house, he could say that the defence of the accused was not perfected, because the counsel for the accused did not conceive it necessary to sum up, and remark upon the evidence. Such was that learned gent.'s reliance on the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0157"/>
<col>285</col>
strength of his clients. To supply that omission was one reason why it' was the' wish of the accused to be heard at the bar, and he could state that those gentlemen would feel themselves hardly treated, if they were refused that hearing. It did appear that the case of the accused was but partially and collaterally taken up, and imperfectly heard before the committee, and they were therefore strongly entitled, from common equity, to be^ further heard before the house decided on their case. If the house proceeded to a discussion in the way proposed, it would be as well to pronounce judgment upon the accused, from the resolutions of the committee at once, without any review of the evidence, as such review would be superfluous.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01094"><member>Lord Marsham</member><membercontribution> observed, that the counsel for the accused not having summed up and remarked on the evidence before the committee, was no fault of the committee. The noble lord thought the parties ought to be allowed to supply that omission by hearing their counsel at the bar.&#x2014;In some farther conversation between Mr. Fox, Mr. Pitt, and the Attorney General, it was understood to be the intention of Mr. Pitt to oppose the hearing of counsel upon the question as to the guilt or innocence of the accused; but that right hon. gent, observed, that upon the question as to the measure of punishment, it was competent to any member to propose the calling in of counsel.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01095"><member>Mr. J. Hawkins Browne</member><membercontribution> supported the motion. In animadverting on what had fallen from an hon. gent, opposite (Mr. Sheridan) he said, that if the sheriffs had not been fully heard in the committee it was owing to their counsel, for he understood that it had been a matter agreed between the counsel of both sides, that if the one forbore to criminate the sheriffs, the other would be less urgent in their defence. To this cause he therefore attributed the counsels not summing up the evidence in favour of the sheriffs, which the hon. gent. had alluded to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01096"><member>Mr. J. Fitzgerald</member><membercontribution> stated, that the parliament of Ireland had adopted also the Grenville act. But they had also gone farther and adopted it with an amendment. There, appeared here to be no particular law in regard to the returning officer, but the parliament of Ireland had provided by express act for cases of the kind now before the house* When the conduct of the
<col>286</col>
returning officer was made the subject of investigation, pare was taken he should receive due notice of it, and be accordingly prepared for his defence. This notice the committee was bound to give him before they could institute any proceedings against him. But according to the Grenville act the committee were under no necessity of deciding on the conduct of the returning officer; this duty therefore became more particularly the province of the house. A good deal had been said of the analogy of the present case, with the proceedings usual in Courts of law. This analogy had been denied by a learned gent, opposite, who had referred them to the practice of the court of King's Bench. He had only to remind him, however, that it was very usual in such courts, after verdict had been given to receive affidavits from the parties. There was such a thing as moving for a new trial and an arrest of judgment in those courts, which might be considered as proceedings somewhat analagous to the present question. The hon. and learned gent, concluded with professing himself adverse to the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01097"><member>The Chanc. of the Excheq.</member><membercontribution> begged leave to put the hon. gent, right in regard to the duty of the committee. The gentleman had said chat the committee was not bound to judge of the returning officer, that question not being before it in virtue of the Grenville act; but had the hon. gent. had recourse to the votes of the house, he would have found that the petition of Mr. Mainwaring complained of the conduct of the sheriffs expressly, and that this petition, with the complaint, was referred to the committee. The conduct of the sheriffs, therefore, became the direct subject of the committee's investigation.&#x2014; The question being then called for, the gallery was cleared, no division, however, took place. Mr. Pitt's motion was acceded to, and the order discharged accordingly. The first resolution of the committee was then agreed to, and the debate postponed till this day vwek,&#x2014;Adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

Even in his own short experience, many instances had occurred wherein similar amendments had passed without objection.

The regular course of the house, he was aware, would be to bring this subject forward in a committee of ways and means; but from the nature of his proposition on this occasion, he thought it would be better to bring it forward in a committee of the whole house, which he now gave notice he should do to-morrow. While he was on his legs, however, it would be as well to give the house some intimation as to the present state of that business. He had, therefore, to inform them, that out of the 22 millions outstanding of that loan, oh the close of the last session of parliament, the holders of 13 millions had subscribed1 to the terms then proposed; and of the remaining sum, the holders of 4&#x00BD; millions

<title>THIRD ADDITIONAL PAPERS RELATIVE TO THE DISCUSSION WITH SPAIN' IN 1803 AND 1804, PRESENTED BY HIS MAJESTY'S COMMAND TO ROTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, 6th FEBRUARY, 1805.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01108">No. 1&#x2014;<i>Copy of a Dispatch from Lord Hawskesbury to J. H. Frere, Esq. dated Downing-street,</i> 1st Oct. 1802.&#x2014;Sir; The accustomed political relations between this country and Spain being re-established, it is important that I should inform you of the line of conduct which it will be pro-
<col>290</col>
per for you to adopt, and of the language which you ought to hold in your communications with the Spanish govt. at his maj.'s minister at Madrid.&#x2014;You will omit no opportunity of assuring the ministers of his Catholic maj. conformably to your instructions, of the sincere and anxious desire of the king to cultivate a good understanding between the two countries; and, in order to give a full effect to these sentiments, you will manifest, in all your proceedings, the most friendly and conciliatory conduct.&#x2014;There are 3 objects of different value in themselves, which you should always bear in mind in your com&#x2014;rhunications with the Spanish govt. and which you will bring forward as circumstances will permit.&#x2014;The 1st would be to establish an unreserved confidence, and a friendly connection between our two governments; this, though highly desirable, may be attended with insurmountable difficulties from the prevalence either of the French interest in the Spanish councils, or from the dread of French power. The success of it will depend in a great measure upon the characters and disposition of the Spanish ministers. The object is, however, so important, that no means, to which we can with prudence resort, ought to be neglected for its accomplishment. The 2d object would be to secure the neutrality of Spain in the event of another war between his maj. and France. All the reasoning applied to the 1st object will be applicable, in a still greater degree, to the 2d: and there may be circumstances under which this object may be attainable, when the 1st must be necessarily abandoned. The 3d object proceeds upon the ground of the two former being found impracticable, and of the impossibility of dissolving the connection which has subsisted between France and Spain. In that case our utmost endeavours should be used to render Spain, in the event of a war, an unwilling and tardy enemy. It it scarcely necessary for me to inform you, that much would be obtained even by success in this particular, for if, in the event of a war, the Spanish govt. could be induced to enter, even slowly, into the views of France, and to create as many delays as possible by negotiation before they had recourse to hostilities, his maj. would have the advantage of being able to direct the whole of his force in the first instance against France, and would not be under the necessity, at the commencement of a war, when the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0160"/>
<col>291</col>
disposable naval force of this country is necessarily less considerable than it is at succeeding periods, of diverting this force to too many quarters, at the time when he is least prepared. These different objects are to be preferred in the order in which they stand, and his maj. relies on your zeal to give effect to the instructions he has given you respecting them. I am, &amp;c HAWKESBURY.</p>

Events have occurred which may possibly lead to a rupture between his maj. and the French govt. I think it important that you should be apprised of them; and I therefore inclose you a copy of the note verbale which I presented to M. Otto, on the affairs of Switzerland, and of the instructions which have been given to Mr. Moore on the same subject. You will consider these communications as made to you in the strictest confidence; but if, as may be expected, any conversation should arise between you and the Spanish govt. on the subject, you will not fail to represent the system of encroachment and aggrandizement which has been invariably manifested by the French govt. since the conclusion of the definitive treaty, in its proper colours, and how essential it is that every independent state should unite in resisting the exorbitant pretensions of France. You will conform yourself, in your communications on this subject, as much as possible to the general instructions contained in my dispatch, No. I. and you will, above all, endeavour to impress upon the Spanish govt. his maj.'s anxious desire that, in the event of a war between him and France, the,, court of Madrid may be induced at least to preserve a strict neutrality, and his maj.'s determination, in that case, to respect that neutrality by every means in his power.&#x2014;I am, &amp;c.

<image src="S1V0003P0I0161"/>
<col>293</col>
most striking articles of the two treaties, it clearly appears that the family compact was in reality a treaty of alliance offensive and defensive, since it stipulated, that the allied power who was not at war should consider the enemy of his ally as his own, whilst the alliance of 1796 is in itself merely defensive, inasmuch as it only exacts certain succours from the allied power who may be menaced or attacked, and that the alliance does not become offensive, unless the motives for hostilities being prejudicial to both parties, they should declare war by common consent. This observation is so much the more necessary, as the 1st art. of the treaty of 1796 has this expression: "there shall exist a "perpetual alliance offensive and defensive between the French republic and his "Catholic maj. the king of Spain." Those who may not attentively peruse the treaty, and those particularly who may not compare it with the family compact, might be led from this vague expression, to believe that an offensive and defensive alliance actually exists at one and the same time; that is to say, that the ally of the power attacked must <i>ipso facto</i> consider, the enemy of that power as his own, and believe himself in a state of war with him, and consequently as out of his power to continue neutral towards him.&#x2014; It is equally important to attend to the text of the 11th art. of the treaty of 1796, and particularly to the phrase, "shall put in action the greatest "force in their power," for this force is, and can only be, an augmentation of the succours to be made to the stipulated succours, but it is an augmentation which can take place, 1st, only in the event of the succours furnished not being sufficient; and, 2ndly, only according to the power and means which the party required may have for making the augmentation. One sees at once that it cannot be otherwise 1st, because if by the aforesaid phrase it was meant that the power required should be considered as bound to put in action all his forces, it would be absurd, since he could not do more even where he himself at war with the enemy of his ally: 2dly, because the 13th art. of the same treaty exacts the employment of the whole of the forces of the power required, only in the case wherein the two powers should declare war by common consent against other powers.</p>

<col>294</col>
the ally of France, and at the same time a friend of England, finds herself at this moment called upon to fulfil towards each of them the respective duties of alliance and of friendship.&#x2014;The treaty of alliance concluded with France in 1796, although termed an offensive and defensive alliance, being only, properly speaking, an alliance strictly defensive, according to the tenour of all its articles, and the striking difference which exists between its engagements, and those contained in the family compact of 1761, his catholic maj. trusts, he can reconcile his engagements to furnish to France the succours stipulated by the treaty of 1796, with his most ardent desire to maintain his friendly connections with his Brit. maj. The perfect harmony and good understanding, which have subsisted between the two monarchs since the re-establishment of the last peace; the reciprocal proceedings and the principles of the law of nations to be pursued under circumstances similar to those in which G. Brit. and Spain are actually placed, are so many reasons, which prove the justice and the necessity of the conduct, which his Cathalic maj. proposes to pursue at the present moment. France confining herself to the requisition of the stipulated succours, and Spain to furnishing them to her, but without allowing herself to commit any act of direct hostility against England; his Catholic maj. cannot for a moment doubt of his Brit, maj.'s disposition to observe a like conduct on his part. &#x2014;By such a conduct, his Brit. maj. would, in the first instance, afford to Spain, and to all Europe, a proof of his justice, of his wisdom, and of his impartiality. He would make a distinction between a friendly power who did not furnish succours to his enemies through ambition, resentment, any vicious views, or others inimical to him, but solely to fulfil general eventual engagements previously contracted, and the power who should form connections inimical to England with her enemy, in the very moment of war, and with the same hostile spirit and views as its ally. His Brit, maj. would obtain for the people of G. Brit, and Ireland the great advantage of the continuance of their commerce with Spain, not only during the present war, but also in all those in which neither party having any subject of complaint against the other, England would remain in friendship with Spain, notwithstanding her being at war with France. His Brit, maj. would besides establish from this moment the just idea
<image src="S1V0003P0I0162"/>
<col>295</col>
which should be entertained, especially in England, that a rupture with France does not necessarily produce ipso facto, and, according to treaties, a rupture with Spain. &#x2014;His Brit. maj. and his ministry are too just and too enlightened for it to be supposed that they can entertain an opinion contrary to the principles above stated, or to the advantages which England would derive from them, even should she agree to the system of conduct pursued by Spain. Sc fully convinced is the king of this, that he cannot, entertain the smallest doubt upon the subject; and he expects with perfect confidence to receive, in the concurrence of his Brit. maj. and of his govt. in the system of the king's conduct, a new proof of their rectitude, and of their friendly sentiments towards the king and the Spanish, people.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01115">No. 5.&#x2014;<i>Translation of Memorandum from the. Chev. d'Anduaga, without Signature or Date, received</i> 1<i>st Sept.</i> 1803.&#x2014;The question, whether England shall acknowledge the' neutrality of Spain, appears to be reduced to the determining whether the treaty of that power, with France of the year 1796, is an offensive or defensive alliance. It is agreed, that if this treaty merely contains stipulations of limited succours, it might be considered as no alliance strictly defensive; but as it is staled in the 1st art of the treaty, "there shall exist a perpetual offensive and defensive alliance between the French republic and his Catholic maj. t" and moreover, in the 2d art. that if the stipulated succours were or should become insufficient, the two powers should put in action' the greatest forces in their power; it is pretended, that by this new obligation the succours become unlimited, and therefore the alliance takes an offensive character.&#x2014;With respect to the 1st art. of the treaty, it is to be observed, that the offensive and defensive alliance spoken of is in fact two alliances each of a different kind, and which refer to two different periods. The 1st is that in which the power, whose ally is threatened or attacked, acts merely as an auxiliary. The 2d is that in which both powers should declare war by common consent against one or more powers. The 1st period relates to defensive, the 2d to offensive alliance; and although the 1st art. embraces the two periods collectively, the other articles of the treaty distinguish them in the clearest planner; and it is evident that the defensive alliance takes place in one case, and the-offensive alliance in another; which
<col>296</col>
latter is merely hypothetical, as it cannot take place, but when the two allies shall declare war by common consent; consequently the defensive alliance may exist, without its becoming an offensive one, and without being in contradiction to the lstart. which speaks of the one and the other at the same time. &#x2014;This same distinction of the two alliances, and of the two periods, serves equally to explain the 11th article in its true sense, and with that justice which is required by the definition of a treaty, on the nature and extent of which doubts have arisen. The treaty itself fixes and separates in its articles the two alliances, and the two periods, in such a manner as, that, on the bare reading of it, one discovers that the art. 12. closes the 1st period; and that the 2d commences at art. 13. that is to say, that art. 11. relates to the defensive alliance, and art. 13. to offensive alliance, from which it results, that art. 11. as relating to the period of defensive alliance, should be explained according to the nature of that alliance, and according to the analogy which the accessory condition contained in art. 11. has with the principal conditions mentioned in the preceding articles.&#x2014;The nature of defensive alliances is to compel an auxiliary to furnish to his ally limited succours; and this is the case in the alliance in question; for the expression, "shall put in action the greatest force in their power," neither can nor ought to be construed as if the auxiliary was compelled to make the same efforts as the ally, but each one in proportion to the nature of his situation. The one puts in action all his forces to defend himself against the enemy, or to do him all possible injury; the other adds to the succours to be furnished any other in his power, to assist his ally, but always in quality of auxiliary, and in proportion to the stipulated succours. That expression of art. II. which appears in the 1st instance to Call upon the auxiliary to furnish ultimately as much or more to his ally, has, in fact, no other meaning than this; the auxiliary shall make whatever addition may be in his power to the stipulated succours:" and, although the amount of the new succours is not fixed in article 11. it is evident, that it is because much cannot be required of the auxiliary, after having received that which, according to the nature of the alliance, the auxiliary was bound to furnish. And it is also an advantage to the auxiliary, that art. 11. does not specify the amount; to be added to the first succours, for,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0163"/>
<col>297</col>
otherwise, the ally would have the power to prescribe how much the auxiliary ought to furnish him in conformity to the treaty; instead of which at present it is the auxiliary himself who is to fix the extent of the succours, according to his position and his own interests, but, however, without failing in his engagements. The auxiliary being called upon to decide upon this point, can never depart from the rule which he ought to follow in his proceedings, if he means to preserve his character of auxiliary, and to consult his own interests. One of his first interests is that of preserving his connections of friendship and good understanding with the power who may be at war with his ally, since, if the auxiliary should exceed the limits of his duty towards the ally by furnishing considerable succours, he would degenerate into the real enemy of the said power. This consideration is likewise the surest guarantee to that power, that the auxiliary will confine himself within the boundaries which his situation prescribes It therefore follows, that, conformably to the rules of justice and equity, and of the position of an auxiliary towards his ally, the proportion of subsidies to be added should rather be lessened; because, infixing the. line of demarcation between a- defensive and offensive alliance, the more one shall incline to the latter, the more the auxiliary power would incur the risk of being forced into a war, and the more would she deprive herself of those forces of which she would stand in need for her own preservation, in case she herself should have a war to sustain.&#x2014;All this reasoning is founded upon the treaty of 1796 itself; because, after having spoken of the succours to be-furnished in the first instance, and afterwards of putting in action the greatest force which both powers can bring forward, it is stated, in the 13th art that, when they declare war by common consent, the "limitations established" in the preceding articles shall cease to have effect. From whence it is clear, that even, according to art. 13, the additional succours are acknowledged to be limited succours.</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01117">No. 7.&#x2014;<i>Translation of a Letter from, the Chev. d'Anduaga to Lord Harrowby, dated Portland Place,</i> 4<i>th Nov.</i> 1804.&#x2014;My lord, immediately after the receipt of dispatches from my court the day before, yesterday, I called at the office for foreign-affairs requesting an interview with your excl. Having learned from Mr. Hammond that you were unwell, but notwithstanding ready to see me in case I should absolutely require it, I judged it would be indiscreet to intrude upon you, and contented myself with mentioning to Mr. Hammond the subject of the conversation I wished to have with your excl. requesting him at the same time to induce your 1dp. to grant me an audience as soon as possible. In the mean time I hasten to inform you, that I have received by the last packet from Lisbon a copy of Mr. Frere's note of the 37th Sept. and of the answer of my court thereto.&#x2014;I cannot conceal from your excl. the surprise which the perusal of Mr. Frere's letter has occasioned me, when compared with the striking contrast displayed in the noble, frank, and moderate style and tone held by the Spanish minister. Mr. Frere in too easily taking for granted a fact of which he should previously have ascertained the existence and the precise nature, protests against a naval armament preparing at Ferrol. Mr. Frere has been led into an error when he gave credit to such an armament, since none exists of a nature to justify the complaints which he has brought forward in hi? letter.&#x2014;If in the beginning of Sept. the king my master thought proper to give orders for some ships of war to sail for Biscay, in order to transport ships thither, his maj. was unfortunately but too well justified by the troubles which had just broken out there in taking that step. Mr. Frere could not be ignorant of this circumstance, and consequently ought never to have attributed such odious intentions to preparations the destination of which it was so easy to discover-Neither had the Brit. govt. any ground for alarm in hearing of these. preparations, since the Naiad, the frigate which brought the account of these pretended armaments,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0164"/>
<col>299</col>
brought also several letters, announcing, in a positive and uniform manner, the real object of them. I mentioned them myself to your excl. in my conference of the 24th Sept. and on the 26th I had the honour of presenting Mr. Brickdale, lieut. col. of the regt. of Hibernia, who shewed your excl. two letters which he had received from his colonel, dated 5ih and 11th Sept. These letters, dated from Ferrol, written by the commander of a corps in garrison there, and filled with details respecting the destination of the troops, of which his own regiment, itself was to form a part, were convincing testimonies, and well calculated to remove the shadow of a doubt. But this is not all: If it were necessary to furnish other data in order to re-establish confidence in the British govt. subsequent advices from Ferrol of the 18th Sept. must have completely convinced your excl. of the entirely pacific intentions of my court; inasmuch as at that moment his maj. had actually ordered every preparation to be suspended, and the troops destined to re-establish tranquillity in Biscay to be sent by land.&#x2014;After this, how is it possible that Mr. Frere, in his note of the 27th Sept. has not hesitated to treat as "an hostile aggression," an armament (if it can be so called) which had ceased for several days, and which by the notoriety of its destination could not have merited, under any case, so extraordinary a denomination? How could he represent to the king in such unfavourable and unjust colours a measure not less foreign to the interests of England than indispensable for the support of Older in a province of Spain? How could he think it necessary to call the attention of the Spanish govt. "to the serious consequences which must result from their "answer, lest they should plunge Spain "unnecessarily into a ruinous war?"&#x2014;How different from the tone of bitter menace which pervades the whole of Mr. Frere's letter is the language, full of dignity and good faith, of moderation and of frankness, in which the note of the Spanish ministry is expressed; strong in the purity of the views with which the king's mind has been ever guided, the Spanish ministry in their answer content themselves with the assurance "that his maj. never entertained "an idea of being wanting to his engagements with the Brittsh govt.; that they "would continue, as they had hitherto "done, to prevent any armament being "fitted out against Gt. Brit, and that every "report which might have reached Mr. "Frere contrary to such assurance is ab-
<col>300</col>
"solutely void of foundation, and injurious "to the reputation which the Spanish govt. "so justly possesses."&#x2014;This answer, which is in no degree contradicted by the information received by the British ministry relative to the pretended armament, being perfectly consonant with the loyal and systematic conduct which my court has invariably followed since the rupture between G. Brit, and France, ought to inspire the British govt. with confidence as to the pacific sentiments which his maj. has never ceased to cherish with regard to England. Moreover, the king has the welfare of his people too much at heart; he attaches too much interest to what he owes to other sovereigns, to permit him, in the midst of peace, setting treaties at defiance, and in opposition to his most solemn and sacred promises, to venture on a step which would draw down on his kingdoms the most cruel of all scourges, would deal a deadly blow against his fame, and tear from him that treasure which his maj. values beyond all others, the testimony of his conscience.&#x2014;I am, &amp;c.</p>

The Spanish frigate which left Cadiz on the 22d Oct. last, with all the security naturally inspired by the completely pacific relations which were supposed still to subsist between Spain and England, having on the following day fallen in. with the Donegal of 84 guns, and the Medusa of 44; this latter ship, after having fired one gun, which, in the usual manner, the Mathilde returned, made not the least scruple of discharging at her a whole broadside. The Spanish capt. astonished at such a proceeding, complained of it' to the commander of the Donegal, who having asked him some questions with regard to the time of his departure, and the number of the sick who were on board the frigate, requested him to send him a boat. The Spanish capt. sent him accordingly the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0165"/>
<col>301</col>
boat with an officer of the navy, who speaks English, and directed him to convey to the British commander the expression of all those sentiments which naturally arise in similar occasions between officers belonging to two friendly govts. Perceiving, that the Spanish officer was detained too long, the capt. of the Mathilde requested the English commander to send him back as soon as possible, in order that he might be enabled to continue his voyage. To this the commander replied that he was occupied in writing a letter, which was soon after sent to him. The import of this letter, which was written in English, was, that the differences which had arisen between the two courts having obliged that of London to order the detention of all Spanish ships of war, the commander was under the necessity of detaining the Mathilde, and summoned the captain to surrender without making any resistance, and in the space of 5 minutes, "if he did not wish to be sunk." The Spanish capt. not understanding English, directed the officer who was the bearer of this letter, to explain to him the subject of it; but what was his surprise, when the ship of the line and the frigate began to fire on the Mathilde, before the above-mentioned officer could get at the contents of the letter. The Spanish capt. defended himself with courage against this unforeseen attack, and did not surrender to so prodigious a superiority of force till after a resistance as honourable as it was useless, in which 2 of his ship's crew were killed, and several others wounded.&#x2014;I will abstain from any reflections on the manner in which the English commander conducted himself on this occasion. Proceedings of this nature cannot but dishonour those who are guilty of them; they are too openly repugnant to the laws of honour not to excite indignation in every mind endowed with the noble sentiments which it inspires.&#x2014;But I think it my duty to observe to your excl. that this new violation of the law of nations can only tend to augment the doubts to which the unfortunate event of the 5th of Oct. will necessarily have given rise in his maj.'s mind, as to the sentiments which the British ministry entertains towards him; at the same time that it will convince his maj. of the inutility of the efforts which he has made to maintain his amicable relations with England.&#x2014;That the British govt. should have been alarmed, on
<col>302</col>
learning the first accounts of our preparations at Ferrol, when they were transmitted to them through channels which seemed to take pleasure in disfiguring the truth, and in representing it in a light altogether unfavourable; that under the first emotion of surprise, to which nevertheless it never should have so easily yielded, it should have given that extraordinary order, the unhappy consequences of which will have struck with astonishment all the courts of Europe, was doubtless a proceeding as opposite to the most sacred principles, as it was unexpected from the relations subsisting between the two courts; but it still left the hope, that, recovering from its former alarms, and after having received more correct intelligence on the nature and the object of our preparations, the British govt. would give express orders to its ships to respect henceforward the Spanish flag, and would await with the tranquillity natural to a ministry sincerely desirous of the continuance of peace, the issue of the negotiations entered upon with Spain.&#x2014;But when Spain shall perceive that nothing will cause the British ministry to desist from its hostile measures: that neither the impartial conduct which my court has constantly manifested since the commencement of hostilities between France and England, nor the total suspension of the preparations at Ferrol, the only motive alleged by England to: justify the system which she seems to have made it a rule to adopt for this some time past, nor the frank and moderate answer made to the exaggerated representations of the English charge d'affaires residing at Madrid, can secure his maj. from the insults which his flag continually receives, will it not warrant a suspicion that England purposes to accumulate on Spain every kind of aggression, in order to bring on a rupture, which the well-known sentiments of his maj. and his constant eagerness to prevent every subject of reciprocal complaint, ought to render impossible? I will confess to you, my lord, in frankness, however animated the king my master may be with the sincere desire {o maintain his relations of friendship-, with the British govt. however ready he may. be to make still more sacrifices for the. maintenance of peace; if England perseveres if the system which its govt. has lately developed, his maj. will find himself obliged to stifle the pacific sentiments of his heart, in order to attend only to the interest.

which he takes in the welfare of his people, and in the complete security of his kingdoms.&#x2014;It only depends, therefore, on the British govt. to prevent the disastrous consequences of such an event, by putting an end to those hostile measures, the continuance of which would be an incontestible proof in the eyes of all Europe, that it was absolutely decided upon to make war on Spain.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01122">(<i>Inclosure in No.</i> 10.)&#x2014;<i>Medusa, at the Motherbank,</i> l6th Nov. 1804.&#x2014;Sir; I have received your letter of the 13th inst. and in reply thereto I have to acquaint you, that during a very squally night of the 22d ult. the Donegal and Medusa were separated, and that on the morning of the 23d, at half past 7, A. M. we saw a ship in the N. E. which we judged to be a man of war (and not the Donegal); I consequently wore and made sail towards her. As we approached, I observed she was evidently a Spanish frigate, and making sail to cross us. She going on a wind to the S. W. we to the northward, wind at W. N. W. I consequently let two reefs out, and hoisted an English St. George's ensign. Nearly at the same moment I saw the Donegal in the N. W. hull de-
<col>304</col>
pressed, boarding a merchant brig, and soon after bear up and make sail to words us.&#x2014;At about half past 9, the strange ships crossed our weather bow about. 1 mile, under Spanish colours and a press of sail, I ordered a shot to be fired far a-head of her, which she answered by a gun without a shot, but did not bring to. I fired a 2d and 3d, when she fired I shotted; and when she was upon our weather beam, I ordered the broadside to be fired over her, and tacked; she then brought to. During this time the Donegal had closed, and while I was working the Medusa up, some communication had passed between sir R. Strachan and the Spanish capt. and about half past 10 sir Rd. summoned me on' board by signal (their lordships are already in possession of the result of our determination, which was the effect of mature' deliberation; after which a quarter past noon, I returned to my ship, and the space of 10 minutes being elapsed from the time the Spanish officer had gone on board his ship, sir Rd. made the Medusa's signal to wear and engage (I must here observe that the Medusa was about pistol shot distant upon the Mathilde's lee beam, and the Donegal advanced upon her weather bow), having previously urged, me to be cautious not to hurt any one on board the Spanish frigate, if it was possible to be avoided, and to give my orders to fire over her; and previous to my quitting the Donegal, I heard sir Rd. charge his officers to the same effect.&#x2014;I did so, and upon our firing our broadside a head, a-stern, and over her, she struck her colours; but the situation of the Donegal prevented sir Rd. Strachan perceiving it, and as the Spanish broad pendant was still flying, the Donegal fired her quarter deck and poop carronades, but not a single gun (her lower deck guns were not run out), nor did the Medusa fire a gun a 2d time. Only 2 shot struck the Mathilde; I from the Donegal entered her larboard bow in the carpenter's store room, and I from the Medusa entered her side at the gangway; and I most roundly assert, that neither officer nor man was killed or wounded on board her, both from our own knowledge and the declaration of capt. de la Guardia, and all his officers, for it was the 1st question I asked when they came on board the Medusa, and the Spanish capt. has repeatedly told me, that all our shot, except 2, went clear of the Mathilde.&#x2014;And how he could deliberately assert that we had killed 2,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0167"/>
<col>305</col>
and wounded several of the crew, I am at a loss to conceive, more particularly as that letter was written in my cabin, and I furnished him with data, and ultimately sent his letter to the Spanish minister, with the dispatches to their lordships, on the day of our arrival, which is the only circumstance in this transaction of which I can charge myself with having acted improperly, and even here I trust I can acquit myself, for I did it with the motive of befriending capt. de la Guardia, his officers and crew, and of obtaining them that relief which I had it not in my power to bestow.&#x2014;The following copy of sir It. Strachan's letter to capt. dela Guardia refutes his assertion, that the capt. of the Donegal recommended him to surrender without resistance ("s'il ne vouloit pas &#x00EA;tre coul&#x00E8; bas.") "His <i>Maj.'s Ship Donegal,</i> 23d Oct. 1804.&#x2014;Sir; The negotiations which are pending between our two govts. render it my duty to prevent his Catholic maj.'s frigate Mathilde under your command, from proceeding upon her present voyage, and that I must detain her until my sovereign's pleasure is further known. I therefore request you will surrender to our wishes, and I allow you the space of 5 minutes to determine. I beg leave to call your attention to the very great superiority of force now before you, and that any resistance on your part must be unavailing; and I must add, that if his maj.'s. ships or subjects receive any injury, you must expect it to be retaliated severely. I have, &amp;c. R. I. STRACHAN."&#x2014;Facts speak strongly in this case, for had it been our intention to have struck the Mathilde, situated as the Donegal and Medusa were, one broadside from each would have annihilated her; instead of which neither mast, yard, sail, or rope, were touched. Did it become me to follow the example of the Spanish capt. to censure and reprobate the conduct of the Spanish govt. the occurrences during the last 12 months, when I have been entrusted with the command as senior officer of his maj.'s ships and vessels on the Gibraltar station, afford me ample subject for animadversion; and I do not hesitate saying, that the open partiality they have marked towards our enemies merits any chastisement his maj. may think proper to inflict.

<title>[IRISH HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01134"><member>Sir Evan Nepean,</member><membercontribution> in consequence of a notice given yesterday, rose to move for leave to bring in a bill for the further continuance of the act of last session for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland. The right hon. bart. said, that the continuance of the bill was rendered necessary by the existence of disaffection, in a considerable degree, in Ireland; by the avowed determination of the enemy to invade that country, and the preparations notoriously made for that invasion; by the fact of the collection and association of a number of Irishmen with the forces designed for that purpose, and the actual sitting of a committee of United Irishmen at Paris, corresponding with the United Irishmen of Ireland, and stimulating them to continue in acts of treason. In order to defeat their machinations, and counteract such treasonable plots, it became indispensably necessary to arm the Irish govt. by the further continuance of an authority which had already proved so salutary and efficacious in preserving the tranquillity of that country; more especially, too, as the present law would expire within the short period of six weeks, in which case a number of persons now confined in prison upon treasonable charges must be liberated, and left to follow their secret machinations without controul. He should therefore move for leave to bring in a bill to continue for a time to be limited, the said act."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01135"><member>Sir John Newport,</member><membercontribution> in rising to trespass upon the attention of the house, hoped he should not be considered as throwing any censure upon the government of Ireland, or any insinuation that the power reposed by the existing law in the hands of the present Chief Governor of that part of the empire, had been productive of any
<col>312</col>
reprehensible abuse. He could not, however, on so very momentous a proposition as that, for still longer suspending, in so considerable and important a portion of the empire, the most valuable privilege of our glorious constitution, suppress his decided opinion that before the right hon. bart. called for the assent of parliament to his introduction of such a measure, something more than mere light grounds should have been stated to justify such a proposition. The statement that an Irish committee was sitting in Paris, avowing hostile purposes for the invasion of Ireland, was surely not a sufficient reason for suspending the constitution throughout that country, and involving a whole nation under one disgraceful proscription, with a few suspected traitors; for, if the mischief was really as extensive as the bill pretended, something more of explanation, and stronger grounds, ought to be submitted to Parliament, before their assent was called for to the continuance of so severe a measure. If the continuance of such a committee sitting at Paris was to operate as a justification for the continuance of such a law, we must look to no other limitation for its existence than the continuance of the war: for if the enemy should perceive that the appointment of such a committee at Paris was to operate as a cause for the perpetuation of a law that could not fail to wound and exasperate the national pride and feelings of the Irish people, and so far mould them to the purposes of discontent and disaffection, they might rest assured the enemy would be zealous to keep up that committee, and attach to it the utmost possible importance, if it were only to create a ground of alarm, distrust, and apprehension, towards Ireland, and thus to weaken the energies of both countries. He had been taught from his youth to estimate the benefits of the Habeas Corpus Act as the most invaluable part of the British constitution, and to think that it never ought to be suspended but upon the strongest grounds; all he should now say was, that no such grounds had been shewn as yet. It was of the first importance, that the people of Ireland should be taught to feel that the Imperial parliament was as, tender of their privileges, and as vigilant with regard to their rights and liberties, as towards those of the people of England. He would say, that with respect to Ireland, or North Britain, they ought even to be greater than them with respect to Eng-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0171"/>

land; and the granting such extraordinary powers in those parts of the empire ought to be most narrowly looked to, for great powers exercised at a great distance were more liable to be abused than when they were under the immediate inspection and controul of parliament. Instances had already been laid before the house of such powers being stretched, when the exercise of them was remote from examination. He therefore thought the house should not grant such powers when there was no ground laid. Nay, even the ground which was laid by the movers of the proposition was adverse to it. For when he looked back to the extraordinary circumstances with which the motion was introduced, he could not help thinking, that it was matter of doubt with the hon. gentlemen themselves whether the suspension should be renewed: First, above a week since notice had been given of the intention to move for the renewal. Two days after, this notice was expressly abandoned. He asked, why was the proposition of renewal first brought forward? having been brought forward, why was it abandoned? having been abandoned, why was it brought at all? He asked whether a measure of this kind, which was to be justified only by unavoidable necessity, which was hostile and dangerous to the vital principles of the constitution, should, without sufficient cause, be put upon a country, the greater part of whose people was as veil affected to the govt. as the English themselves? He conceived that this justification of so harsh a measure was particularly due to the people of Ulster, who were remarkable for their loyalty and attachment to the British constitution and British connexion; but who were at the same time a strong minded people, not likely to be satisfied with a measure of this nature, unless sufficient cause for it were shewn to them. He should, therefore, conclude with moving, as an amendment to the motion, the omission of the latter part of the motion, from the word 'that,' for the purpose of inserting these words, "that a committee, consisting of 21 members, be formed by ballot, to examine such documents as may be laid before them, and to report to this house their opinion upon these documents, whether the continuance of the suspension of the habeas corpus act be a measure necessary to the tranquillity of Ireland at the present time."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01136"><member>Mr. Dennis Browne</member><membercontribution> agreed that the greater
<col>314</col>
part of the people of Ireland were altogether as loyal as the people of this country; but the circumstances in which Ireland stood at present were distinct from those of any former time. It was not alone the machinations of committees of united Irishmen sitting in Paris, that were to be apprehended and guarded against, but multitudes of them distributed along the whole coast of the French empire, prepared for invasion, communicating with the disaffected at home, and sending emissaries before them to excite discontent, and insurrection among the people. Under these circumstances, it was prudent and necessary to continue the suspension; and not to endanger the constitution by exposing it, with unguarded confidence, to the attacks of those who would take shelter behind it for the purpose of destroying it. It was well known, that hired emissaries from France had come to Ireland with the treasonable designs of exciting disaffection, and conveying information. His great object in supporting the measure now proposed was to prevent these wretches from prosecuting their infamous purposes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01137"><member>Mr. Hutchinson</member><membercontribution> deplored the necessity which he supposed the govt. felt of proposing so very strong a measure, without a full and previous explanation of the grounds on which it was demanded. If the necessity was shewn, he was sure no person would differ from them in a moment like the present. He would not, however, refuse his assent because the necessity was not shewn. He wished to call the attention of ministers to the full consideration of the state of Ireland, as he had repeatedly endeavoured to do before. He was, therefore, prepared to give them the most ample support they could desire; though there existed no disturbance, nor apprehension of distraction, to prevent their looking into the whole state and system of the country with a view to that general amelioration which was so much required. It was in the hope and with the design, that no local troubles, no partial disaffection, should call off the attention of parliament, or of his maj.'s cabinet, from the consideration that Ireland at large demanded and deserved of it, that he supported this measure, which was particularly necessary in a war like the present. He lamented again that it was not advisable to state the grounds on which the renewal of the suspension was asked, as they must be secrets of state; and when he acceded
<image src="S1V0003P0I0172"/>
<col>315</col>
to the measure, he hoped and trusted his maj.'s ministers would turn their serious attention to the state of Ireland at large.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01138"><member>Sir John Stuart</member><membercontribution> said, it did not surprise him much that gentlemen should receive the proposition for this measure with so much coldness; but he happened, in the course of his official connection with the govt. of Ireland, to have the melancholy experience of circumstances to prove the necessity for this measure, and he had no hesitation, for one, to declare it was in dispensably requisite for the tranquillity of that country. He was himself the representative of a county as sincerely attached as any in Ireland to Britain, and the Brit. constitution. This measure was called for by the loyal part of the people for their security and protection against the machinations of the disaffected. It was not now prudent or desirable to go through all the circumstances which rendered such a measure necessary in a country just freed from one rebellion which had succeeded to another, and in which this bill would be the principal support of the loyal and well affected. It was also satisfactory to have an assurance from experience, that the powers it gave would not he abused. He knew the nobleman at the head of the Irish govt. and had opportunities of seeing that he inherited from his illustrious ancestors a zealous attachment to the constitution. He had, in fact, conducted himself in such a manner throughout the whole course of his govt. that there was not a man in the country who had not the fullest confidence that he would not abuse any power entrusted to him. With respect to grounds to be laid by govt. from the information that had reached it, he had to say, that while he teas in office in Ireland (as attorney general,) information had been given by persons connected with the disaffected; and that the exposing to public view the channels through which this information had been obtained, would have the effect to deprive govt. of the sources to future discoveries, and to expose the persons who had made the communication to the knife of the assassin. The numbers confined at present were but few; and from the knowledge he himself had of some of them, they were justly detained. If an investigation could with prudence be granted, he had no doubt it would establish the necessity for the support and defence of the loyal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01139"><member>Mr. Windham</member><membercontribution> rose to offer a few obser-
<col>316</col>
vations upon this motion, which it was impossible for him to let pass without comment. The right hon. baronet had shewn no necessity whatsoever for a proposition which could not possibly be acceded to, without some reasonable ground. He had himself supported the suspension of the habeas corpus act on former occasions; but he had never supported it without strong reason. The house had more than once voted such a suspension, but never without strong and clear grounds fairly proved or notoriously existing. He should be sorry it would vote it without such grounds. A measure of this sort, however, was not to be voted as a thing of course, like a malt tax, or any other annual money bill, merely because a minister moves it at 24 hours notice, without any clear reason given why the house should adopt it. It was extraordinary, too, that the arguments offered in support of the measure bore most strongly against it. The first was in fact the very worst that could be thought of. For if the existence of an Irish committee in Paris, or the govt. here being credulous enough to believe that such a committee existed, was on all occasions to be sufficient grounds for suspending the habeas corpus, the suspension would continue, as the hon. baronet very justly said, constantly during the war, and even perhaps in time of peace; and the bare existence of such a committee may be made a ground of a similar suspension in every part of the empire. The question was not, however, what mischief such committees or those connected with them, intended, but what they could produce. It was not what disaffection, they wished or designed to raise in Ireland, but whether their means of disturbing that country were such, that the suspension of the habeas corpus was necessary to prevent them.&#x2014;Was the constitution to be stopped, and set a-going, in this manner? When it was asked why this extraordinary power was called for, it was answered, not that there were disturbances in Ireland; not that it was necessary the better to repel invasion; but that there were committees of united Irishmen sitting at Paris, and that there were mischievous people in Ireland. But the question was not, what either of these descriptions of persons wished to do; but what the others could do with them. None of those who spoke for the motion would give up the point of the general loyalty
<image src="S1V0003P0I0173"/>
<col>317</col>
of the people: all contended, that the great mass of the people were loyal, but that there were some michievous persons: and so there were here in England. But he would ask, whether the mischief that may be produced by these committees in Ireland, was such as to render it necessary to deprive all Ireland of the habeas corpus, the suspension of which may be followed with other measures of a still more odious nature? And the only reason why this broad and unqualified power should be given was, that from the character of the person to whom it was to be entrusted, it was not likely to be abused. In a free country such as this was, and he hoped always would be, the introduction of arbitrary power ought to be guarded against with the strictest jealousy: vast and extraordinary powers ought not to be delegated merely because some mischievous persons were taken up, and the persons to whom the power was to be entrusted for the present were of a mild and moderate disposition. If the govt. was to be armed with extraordinary powers, which it was fit it should when the country wished it for its own security, it was necessary the danger should be of such an extent as to impress on every man's mind the propriety of giving such powers. It should not be said, that no ground should be stated, lest there may be danger of discovering the sources from which the information was derived. The grounds which would justify the putting the country under martial law could not be of such a secret nature. The extent and magnitude of it must be such as to render it generally known. However, if any objection of this kind could be made with any propriety, it was obviated by the mode of inquiry which was proposed by the hon. bart. (sir J. Newport.) He recollected also that an hon. friend of his, if he would allow him to call him so (Mr. Dillon), in moving the address to his maj. drew a very flattering picture of the tranquillity of Ireland. Was it not extraordinary, that without any thing having happened since to do away the effect of this picture, without any explanation to render the colouring of it less strong, the representative of the Irish govt. suddenly started up, and without assigning any reason, proposed to suspend the Brit. constitution in Ireland. He agreed with the hon. baronet (sir J. Newport,) that we ought to be most tender in granting extraordinary powers with respect to Ireland
<col>318</col>
and Scotland, not only as a power exercised at a distance from controul and inspection was more liable to be abused, but also because there was an obligation of honour and consciousness to be delicate in granting powers, the weight of which would fall exclusively on others, while they could not touch ourselves. The declarations of one or two gentlemen, however respectable, was not a ground on which the house ought to be satisfied of the necessity of a measure of this nature. A larger justification ought to be given for depriving of so large a portion of its constitution, a people which had confided its legislature and its liberties to us&#x2014;a confidence which deserved a care and gratitude very foreign to such monstrous proceedings as the one now proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01140"><member>The Chanc. of the Excheq.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;I should be extremely desirous, sir, to give way on the present occasion to any gentleman from Ireland whose knowledge of the subject in question must be valuable, were it not that some observations which fell from the right hon. gent. over the way, which seem to me necessarily to call for animadversion. At the sentiments which he has now expressed, it is impossible for me not to feel some surprise. The position which he appeared to me to hold, seemed to go to this extent, that in no case whatever could the habeas corpus act be injustice suspended without a previous enquiry. If this was not the position which he meant to maintain in its full extent, then much, very much of what he has said was unnecessary, because it did not bear upon the present question. But if it were, why then he must have spoken with a full knowledge that it has been the practice of parliament to suspend this act without any previous enquiry, and that it was actually suspended in the course of last war with his full consent and approbation. But the right hon. gent. does not contend that the renewal is not right, but that it ought not to be granted without previous examination. Are there no circumstances, then, in which a contrary practice may not only be necessary, but strictly justifiable upon every principle of reason and common sense? It does, sir, often happen, that a case may be so clear and so notorious, so open to every man's observation, that a public statement of the grounds upon which it is required to adopt strong measures may be both futile and unnecessary. Such a case is the present, and
<image src="S1V0003P0I0174"/>
<col>319</col>
yet gentlemen come here and tell us, that we require of them to pass an act of this great importance without any reason assigned for it! What, sir, are the reasons, the strong reasons that exist at this moment? We are engaged in a war with a powerful and active enemy, whose object professedly is to destroy the constitution and overturn the liberties of the British empire. His attention is in the first instance directed towards Ireland, where his emissaries are perpetually at work, by means of correspondence and otherwise, to sow disloyalty and sedition. His object is the invasion and destruction of this country, and to attain it his preparations have been carried on with unremitted vigour, and at this moment are not abandoned. Our fleets are now employed in blockading in their harbours the vessels of our enemy, which, if it were not for their care and vigilance, would sail with an army to attempt to carry his threats into instant execution. To assist him in this plan, those who have fled from their own country, perhaps for crimes of different sorts, have been embodied and formed into a kind of regiment. They are the instruments which he employs to prepare the way for the execution of his purposes. They maintain a correspondence with the disaffected in their own country, and employ every means to spread the flame of rebellion over their unfortunate country, unfortunate for having been the birth place of persons who seem so little to understand or consult her true and permanent interests. They have given occasion to the melancholy insurrections which our times have witnessed in that kingdom. To say that these are not reasons for the measure now proposed to be adopted, is tantamount to saying that no facts of any kind can be a reason for it; but it is to the vigilance and precaution, which it is our object still to continue, that we owe the failure of our enemy's projects, and the consequent safety of Ireland, which would be every moment liable to be plunged in all the horrors of rebellion and bloodshed. The right hon. gent. says, that if an Irish committee were always in the event of war to force us to the necessity of suspending the habeas corpus act, then it would almost always be suspended. The numbers of the disaffected Irish were few, he observed, and the influence of the Irish committee could not enable them to do much mischief. There, however, he is not so correct as usual in his enumeration, The Irish
<col>320</col>
disaffected persons are most certainly few in numbers, compared with what they once were. But no person can have the boldness to assert that they are absolutely few. But it is not, solely on the grounds that there are a number of disaffected persons, who we admit are but comparatively small, that we rely in the present instance for a justification of the measure now proposed. It is upon this circumstance, coupled with past experience of the miseries to which the efforts of this minority have brought upon their country; coupled also with the fact, that we are now engaged in a war with an enemy who will let slip no opportunity of turning the remains of sedition and treason that may still exist in Ireland, to his own advantage, and who by means of those who have fled from their own country to throw themelves into the power of a despot, has too many opportunities allowed him. It is most undoubtly probable that, in all wars like that in which we are at present engaged, while our enemy has such means in his power of disturbing our domestic tranquility, and disseminating insurrection and disloyalty, the present measure will be continued. I believe, that this will be the case, and I am not unmanly enough to deny it. It is, sir, a misfortune of the times, that the principles which gave occasion to the French revolution, have found in many countries a number of adherents. These principles unfortunately are not yet extinct. The misfortune of the times, I say render this course necessary, and sad experience proves it to be the only safe one. The right hon. gent. should, therefore, excuse me for acting on the same principles on which he formerly acted, and by which this country has been preserved. But, if any thing surprised me more than another in the right hon. gent.'s speech, it was the extraordinary mis-statement of what has been said of the state of Ireland. My right hon. friend who made this motion, and those who support it, are assailed with the same clumsy weapon, the same clumsy dilemma, with which the right hon. gent. was formerly attacked when he thought with me, and which he was wont to baffle with so much force and ability. This is the famous dilemma to which they were wont to propose to us; either you have a majority of well-affected persons, or you have not: If you have, then there is no occasion for the present proceeding; if you have not, then tell us so at once. This was what we were told, and what he often
<image src="S1V0003P0I0175"/>
<col>321</col>
heard with so much indignation. There was certainly reason to hope that the disaffected would by this time have had their eyes opened; that those who had been carried away by unconstitutional frenzy would have been cured of their madness; that seeing the fruits the French revolution had produced, they would have got enough of that liberty which had yielded only such baneful produce; that if any, from the impulse of religion, were prompted to seek a change in the establishment, it was not possible for any Catholic to listen to any suggestion from France, on that head, after the mockery the French have made of all religion, and particularly after the late transaction, in which the Catholic religion has been impiously compelled to consecrate and sanction a power established by the hand that had profaned it. It was to be hoped from all the worse than bondage which has been introduced by republican fraternity, by the audacity of jacobinism, and the avowed despotism of the present government of France, wherever its influence could reach, that none could be found mad enough to seek alliance pregnant with so much mischief. But was it to be supposed that there was no minority in a part of the empire now indissolubly united, and he hoped never to be separated, which was still weak and wicked enough to cultivate such a connection? Does the right hon. gent. forget what he has said when the disaffected few talked as if they had a majority. When the majority during last war was sounded in our ears, he told us that this majority was nothing but a factious minority, who forced many quiet and peaceable people to appear to serve our schemes and principles, which in their hearts they hated. There are grounds for the measure in question. But this is not all; Ireland is a more distant limb of the empire, and therefore more exposed. This is the point to which our enemy has chiefly directed his attention, and, therefore, we are the more bound to take care that this point, the most important in the British empire, should be preserved from hostile aggression and secret machinations. What, then, is the next point to which he has adverted? He has observed, that whatever may be the excellence of the lord lieutenant's character, he ought not to be entrusted with arbitrary powers. If the excellence of the character of any individual were stated solely as a ground for entrusting him with extraordinary power, I should immediately allow
<col>322</col>
that the point could not be maintained. A necessity for vesting these powers must be first made; but when the necessity presents itself, then certainly it becomes an important consideration to ascertain the character of the person who is to have the execution of the object intended by the grant of such powers. It is in this view I apprehend, that an hon. bart. (sir J. Stewart) over the way, has brought forward the character of lord Hardwicke. This argument of character was applied by the right hon. gent. (Mr. Windham) in the course of last war with his usual talents, when he sat on the same side of the house with myself and when we acted in opposition to those levelling principles which we both thought subversive of the essence of good government, and a scourge to the civilized world.&#x2014;I maintain in the present instance, that ah enquiry would be superfluous, and might be dangerous. It would be in the highest degree imprudent to disclose the sources from whence our information has been derived, and who that has attended to the state of Ireland can reasonably desire that they should? I have the greatest confidence in the discretion of the members of this house. But, in a matter where the life of others may depend upon secrecy, I am sure that few would wish for a disclosure. The matter then rests upon the plain general grounds of notorious necessity, which has been touched upon. The notice has been short. The reason, however, of this is obvious. Notice was given some time ago, but it was suffered to drop on account of the urgency of the business which was likely to come before the house. That business, however, has been unavoidably delayed; and as the time when this act would expire was so near, it was impossible to postpone the notice any longer. Having thus endeavoured to explain frankly and plainly, the grounds of the measure, and the reason of the proceedings with respect to it, I trust I have satisfied the house of the propriety of agreeing to the motion, and given a sufficient answer to the arguments of its opponents.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01142"><member>Mr. Fox.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;Much, sir, as I have been alarmed, and have had to regret the opinions avowed, and the conduct pursued by the ministers of this country for several years back, particularly while headed by the right hon. gent. who now presides over the administration of his maj.'s govt. yet I confess that I have never felt an equal degree of alarm to that which the sentiments he has just uttered have excited in my mind. I should hope, sir, that he did not speak seriously. If he did; if he really and deliberately holds such sentiments, I must say that I consider him as maintaining principles the most alarming that I have ever heard promulgated in this house or this country, and such as I could scarcely suppose it possible that any man who imagined the people of England retained any degree of regard for their liberties, would venture to declare, or who professed even a respect for the spirit of the British constitution would hear without pain. If the doctrines which the right hon. gent. has this night avowed, be those upon which he means to act, and if he should obtain power sufficient to carry them into effect, melancholy indeed is the prospect for this country ! But, perhaps, the right hon. gent. meant to use the declarations I have referred to merely as a defence against the arguments of my right hon. friend (Mr. Windham), and not as the indication of a settled opinion. If even so, they were inefficient to the purpose of such defence, and they certainly went much beyond any principles avowed by the right hon. gent. or any of his colleagues, during the last war; yet they were not inconsistent with those principles. They were different from, though not contrary to, the nature of those maxims which dictated that mischievous course of policy towards the people and their privileges, which it was my uniform endeavour to deprecate and prevent. Indeed, the rt. hon. gent. himself never attempted to go the length he has hazarded to-night. He never before ventured to maintain that because some of the people were bad subjects, the liberty of the whole people should be placed at the discretion of the minister and his agents by the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. With this statement he has coupled something which he meant as a reply to the arguments of my right hon. friend (Mr. Windham), and as a charge upon me and those gent. who acted with me in resisting the frequent motions for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus
<col>324</col>
Act, which in the course of the last way were carried through this house. The hon. gent. stated that my right hon. friend has had recourse, on this occasion, to that which he himself so often baffled before, when used by my friends and me, and which the right hon. gent. calls a "clumsy dilemma." But I would tell him, and my right hon. friend also, that it was not the dilemma we stated they succeeded in refuting, but it was the clumsy misrepresentation of that dilemma, against which they directed their objections. We never did maintain, that, while the majority was loyal, there could be no necessity for a measure similar to that now before the house. We never could have asserted any thing so absurd and clumsy, that the loyalty of a mere majority formed an argument against the adoption of any measures of precaution against the disaffection of a mere minority. We never even said that the loyalty of a considerable majority would furnish an irresistible objection to such measures. Our reasoning was uniformly grounded upon the degree and nature of the disloyalty alleged to exist, which we did not conceive such as to justify the harsh system of proceeding then pursued by the right hon. gent. But it suited the right hon. gent.'s purpose to give another description to our opinions, and against that other and unjust description his arguments were always levelled. The right hon. gent. and his colleagues appeared to me in every instance, to state insufficient grounds to call for the rigorous measures of the last war, but yet almost any grounds they urged at any time, were sufficiency itself compared to those that are laid for the measure now proposed. How is the state of Ireland described, even by those who support this proposition? Why, that it is in general, and particularly in the province of Ulster, which is by far the most populous and important district of the country, and once the most suspected of disloyalty, as sound, as well disposed, and as loyal as any part of England. Here, then, we have a comparison made that enables us to decide as to the nature of the necessity that exists for the farther continuance of such a bill. Here we have a rule and measure to guide our judgment&#x2014;and, what is most extraordinary, furnished to us by the very men, who, notwithstanding, assert the necessity of this measure. But their reason for the assertion is truly curious&#x2014;"because there are some disaffected
<image src="S1V0003P0I0177"/>
<col>325</col>
persons in the country." And where is it, I should be glad to know, that such persons are not to be found? Are there not bad subjects of every kind to be met with, perhaps, in every part of England? Yet, surely, no man will venture to alledge that as a reason for extending the operation of the measure before the house to this country. Perhaps, some one may be found to do so. Possibly the right hon. gent. may feel disposed to urge such a proposition. If he should entertain the wish, most certainly the adoption of the motion of the hon. bart. will afford him a most encouraging precedent. Unless it be pretended that the measure of justice which is due to the people of Ireland is very different from that which belongs to the people of this country, and that different, nay contrary principles of argument are applicable to the two countries, it cannot be said that the English nation enjoys the least security against the suspension of its constitution at the will of any minister, if the motion submitted by the hon. bart. be acceded to upon such slight grounds, or rather upon no grounds whatever.&#x2014;I have stated, that I see not the least necessity for this proposition, and I always stated upon similar propositions in the course of the last war, that I never saw an adequate necessity for adopting them. This statement my full conviction justifies me in repeating, and I say again to the right hon. gent. and to my right hon. friend also, that they never succeeded in their reasoning against my friends and me, but by mis-stating our argument. We continually put the question which naturally suggested itself to our minds, and which my right hon. friend has very properly put to-night, namely of what consequence is the discontent or disaffection of a few, if the great body of the people be sound and loyal? Certainly, the consequence is not such as to warrant the suspension of public liberty; and I never imagined that any man would have the hardihood to assert in this house that it was. But the right hon. gent has exceeded my expectation. In the whole progress of his hostility to freedom, and the constitution of England, never has he uttered any thing so dangerous and alarming as we have heard from him to-night. Never has he attempted to take so great a stride before. In addition to the existence of disaffection in Ireland, the right hon. gent. states another reason for the adoption of the measure under consideration, and it is this,
<col>326</col>
which he described in very lofty terms; that we are engaged in war, and with an enemy who threatens to destroy our constitution and independence. I would ask were we ever at war with any power, particularly in France, that was not willing to destroy our independence, aye, quite as willing as the present government of France? I never heard that we were. It was, however, reserved for the right hon. gent. to maintain that war is a good ground for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act. But the right hon. gent. states, that the enemy threatened Ireland with an invasion; and did he not also threaten G. Britain? Both these reasons, therefore, are as applicable to the one country as to the other, and would, as I said before, equally sustain the extension of the measure before the house to both countries. When reasons of that sort, therefore, are stated, I must feel as much alarm for G. Britain as for Ireland. I approve highly the generous sentiments that have been expressed by the hon. bart. who moved the amendment. He feels a laudable tenderness and solicitude for Ireland, and so do I. But I feel also for G. Britain; and who knows how soon it may be doomed to suffer from the effects of that principle, which the right hon. gent. seeks to establish in the adoption of the motion before the house? That right hon. gent. would, I presume, be the last to deny, that there existed as strong grounds to apprehend an invasion of G. Britain as of Ireland. Different opinions prevailed as to the probability of invasion; but in the mind of the right hon. gent. there seemed to be no doubt that it would take place. Indeed, notwithstanding the close blockade of Brest, and the vigilant activity of our fleets and cruizers, with the increase of our land force, which none professed a desire to increase further than the right hon. gent. still was he haunted by the apprehension, and loudly proclaimed the probability, that an invasion of G. Britain was to be expected from day to day. This I mention, merely to shew, that at least in the judgment of the right hon. gentleman, there exists a good reason, in his view, for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in Great Britain as well as in Ireland; and also to account for the alarm which I think must be universally excited by the opinions he has delivered in the course of this debate. If we are to be told, that although the people
<image src="S1V0003P0I0178"/>
<col>327</col>
of Ireland are as loyal as those of any county, in England, that because some persons in Ireland are alleged to be disaffected, we are, without any other reason, and without any previous examination of the nature and sufficiency of the grounds stated, to assent to the motion of the hon. bart. then I say, adieu to the security of British freedom; adieu to that Habeas Corpus Act which is the proudest boast and noblest guard of the British constitution. If the right hon. gent. and those who act with him, seriously think that the grounds they urge are sufficient to warrant the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, when, I would request to know, I don't mean as to date, but under what circumstances is that important privilege to be restored? Upon looking over the history of this act, I find that when, in former instances, it was thought necessary to suspend its operation, that suspension was but of very short duration. In the reign of Queen Anne it was suspended twice; and during the reign of the two first branches of the House of Brunswick, it was suspended more than once. I find that from the Revolution down to the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, this important privilege was not withdrawn from the British people so often as it has been during a very few years of the administration of the right hon. gent. And yet during the period that intervened, the country was frequently engaged in war &#x2014;frequently threatened with invasion, and was much disturbed by disaffection also: a disaffection which sprung not from Jacobins, but Jacobites. The latter party, I must observe, was quite as resolute and enterprising as the former, and much stronger in numbers, influence, property and power.&#x2014;What a material difference does this reflection manifest between the character and views of the right hon. gent. and that of any minister who preceded him! The right hon. gent. contends that notoriety is a sufficient ground for parliament to proceed upon, without instituting a committee of inquiry. He has so contended on other occasions. But did he and others who thought with him, argue that what they called the notoriety of disaffection, at the commencement of the last war, was an adequate ground to induce parliament to agree to a measure of the same nature as the present? No. And though that notoriety was generally asserted by the right hon. gent. and his friends, and by none, perhaps, more than by my right
<col>328</col>
hon. friend&#x2014;(and I mention, that for the purpose of defending him against the observations just made by the right hon. gent.) although the notoriety was such as was said to be obvious in the public streets, yet ministers did not attempt to apply to parliament for a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act without instituting a committee of inquiry to examine and report upon the information which govt. possessed. That committee made a report to the house, and upon that report the proposals for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act was grounded. This was the course of proceeding which my right hon. friend supported, and this is the course which he recommends now. Can it be said, then, with any degree of fairness, that the least degree of inconsistency is attributable to him for opposing a motion of such importance as the present, which is ushered into the house by the mere statement of a minister, and that statement itself containing such vain and futile grounds. The passing of this act 18 months ago, without any previous inquiry, cannot be justly urged as a precedent to induce even those who agreed to it, to accede to the present motion, for the circumstances are not at all analagous. The alarm created by the intelligence received of the riot in Dublin, afforded some excuse for the precipitancy with which the proposition of ministers was then adopted. It was carried on the spur of the occasion, and some might have hoped, that when there was time, ministers would communicate more satisfactory grounds for the existence of such a measure, or that the house would institute an inquiry to ascertain the necessity of its continuance. These ideas might have influenced the acquiescence of some gentlemen in the conduct they then pursued. But my right hon. friend took a different and a wiser course. He urged the necessity of previous inquiry, and had I been present, I should have certainly supported him, although I should have had to resist the argument of another right hon. friend of mine, who I understand maintained that the bill for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act should, under these circumstances, be immediately passed. (Here Mr. Sheridan, towards whom Mr. Fox looked, signified his dissent.) Then, resumed Mr. Fox, I am glad it is a mistake. I am happy to find that my right hon. friend, was not among the number of those who
<image src="S1V0003P0I0179"/>
<col>329</col>
were deceived in the expectations which induced them to vote for that measure; which, although it has been now 18 months in existence, no inquiry has been instituted, nor have ministers communicated any further information to the house on the subject than what was contained in his maj. message&#x2014;That my right hon. friend was right, notwithstanding the statement of the right hon. gent. in supposing that this measure was dropped, will not, I think, be denied by any candid man who considers the circumstances. After having given notice of the motion some time back, the hon. bart. put it off <i>sine die.</i> The right hon. gent. has said that the reason of that postponement was the press of business: but that need not have prevented the hon. bart. from mentioning some day for bringing it forward again. The omission to do so appears to betray something like a design to take the house by surprise, or to raise an argument out of the shortness of the time between this and the expiration of the act against the delay of any previous inquiry. If, without such inquiry, you enact this measure, upon the mere statement of a minister, upon such evidence, as, according to the principle of the right hon. gent. is sufficient to establish the necessity of a legislative act of this nature; namely, the view and opinion of his maj. ministers, you may as well pass an act at once to invest the executive govt. with the power to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act whenever it pleases. To apply to this house for an act of the description proposed by the right hon. bart. upon such authority as he has mentioned, is quite a mockery; and to answer that appeal by concurring in that act, will, in my mind, amount to little less than a virtual abandonment of our legislative functions. For what means an application to our judgment, unaccompanied by such information as is necessary to qualify that judgment to decide? I cannot understand the curious distinction which the right hon. gent. has drawn with respect to the character of Lord Harwicke, as applied to this measure. My right hon. friend stated manfully, that the character of any man, however pure, could form no reason in his mind to invest that man with arbitrary power. This is exactly my opinion. But the right hon. gent. says, that he only alluded to the character of lord Hardwicke, as an argument against the abuse of the power which this act is meant to estab-
<col>330</col>
lish, but as not at all applicable to the merits of the measure. This is to me a very nice and very unintelligible distinction; for the strongest reason in favour of any grant of power is, that it is, not liable to abuse. Therefore, when the right hon. gent. asserts so much with regard to the disposition and character of Lord Hardwicke, he is strongly recommending this measure; but yet his panegyric upon that noble lord, were it ever so well founded, would have no influence on my mind in favour of this proposition. I know there are certain theorists who hold the maxim, that the most uncontrouled authority may be granted without danger to an honest, able man; nay that an absolute monarchy is the best system of government, if the monarch were possessed of all the virtues and talents of which man is capable, but I am not one of those theorists. Let the disposition of a man be what it may, I will not consent to invest him with extraordinary, unconstitutional powers, for this plain reason, that it is subject to abuse. The virtue of a man is therefore, no argument with me in favour of such grants; because I learn from the history of mankind, because particularly the history of the constitution, and my own experience, forbid such grants, I am impelled to dread the abuse of power to whomsoever it may be given. These are my reasons for not allowing any weight to the argument, drawn from the character of lord Hardwicke. Into that character itself I will not now enter. I have reasons which form stronger grounds of complaint against that noble lord in my mind, than perhaps they would form in the minds of others. I shall not now mention them. It is enough with me to justify the vote I mean to give against the measure under consideration, that I will not intrust such power to any man. If character were a sufficient reason to justify the constitution of such a power, that reason a minister could always find among the nobility of this country. If lord Hardwicke did not answer, another and another nobleman of unexceptionable character could be immediately found to fill his place. I cannot, therefore, listen to such reasoning. My objection is, to grant the power proposed to the office, not to the man.&#x2014;As the right hon. gent. has not hinted when the measure before the house is likely to cease, I suppose, from some observations of his, that it is his intention that it shall continue during the present
<image src="S1V0003P0I0180"/>
<col>331</col>
war, and nothing more likely that he may propose to extend it to this country. if he pleases to do so, he can adduce reasons quite as strong as he has offered in support of the motion of the hon. bart.; and why should it be presumed that the right hon. gent. is not as fond of enjoying extraordinary power himself in this country, as of granting it to any Lord Lieutenant? Ireland being now admitted by all to be in a general state of tranquillity, I cannot conceive what change in her situation can take place that is likely to induce the right hon. gent. to put an end to this odious measure. If, although Ireland be tranquil, the existence of what is called an Irish committee at Paris, he considered a reason for measures like that before the house, then is the French govt. furnished with the means of perpetually and sorely annoying this country, by depriving the people of their liberty. For that govt. has nothing more to do than to create, or to promulgate the existence of an Irish or an English committee also, and upon that, it seems, combined with the popular discontent which such measures as this under discussion, will always produce, an English minister may found a reason for investing himself and his friends with the extraordinary power of suspending the constitution of England. Among other singular and indeed incredible things, we are told by the supporters of this bill, that the majority of the people of Ireland will gladly hear of its re-enactment, because they are so confident of its necessity, and they are so much attached to lord Hardwicke, that they are convinced that any power would in his hands be safe from abuse. As to the disposition of the people I shall say nothing. But there are some facts with respect to the abuse of power in Ireland under this bill, which I shall take an opportunity of stating more at large, when the motion, of which an hon. gent. (Mr. Fitzgerald) has this day given notice, is brought before the house. There is one gross instance of abuse, which I cannot even now refrain from alluding to; I mean that of Mr. Todd Jones. This gent. I have reason to believe, has, on the ground of mere suspicion, suffered a most rigorous imprisonment in a loathsome jail, for upwards of 16 months. From the treatment he has experienced, and the situation in which he is placed, he has, in fact, suffered enough of punishment, even had he been guilty of a heavy crime. In-
<col>332</col>
deed, he has endured so much, that countries where the laws are less several it would be deemed quite sufficient to atone for treason or felony. There are other cases also which I could state, but I shall reserve them for the occasion I have already alluded to. But even suppose I allow every merit that may be ascribed to lord Hardwicke, or his secretary, and those immediately about his govt. still my objection to this bill would not be removed. For I feel it to be one of the great mischiefs of arbitrary power, that even though the principals in the administration of it be ever so virtuous, so vigilant, or so able, still acts will be committed by some of those to whom in its various ramifications, that power will be necessarily delegated, that the principals cannot prevent, and which, if communicated to them, would make them shudder with as much horror as any other persons would be apt to feel. These are the reasons which urge me to resist this and the other bill, of which the hon. bart. gave notice some time since; but of which, I hope, I shall hear no more. I cannot see the least reason for the adoption of such measures, much less such strong grounds of necessity as could alone justify their introduction. I trust, then, that by rejecting them we shall shew the people that we have their liberty not merely in our mouths, but in our hearts; and that we will not abandon our duty to preserve that sacred trust, upon idle rumours, or light ministerial whispers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01143"><member>Sir Evan Nepean</member><membercontribution> said, that he had inquired into the situation of Mr. Todd Jones, and found, that though he was discharged, he had no reason to complain, as he was placed in as comfortable a state as a person in his circumstances deserved.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01144"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> observed, that the judges of assize had stated, as a complaint from the county of Cork, the unwholesomeness of the prison in which Mr. Jones was confined. As to the concluding part of the hon. bart.'s observations, he should take occasion to talk a little more about it when the motion he had already alluded to should come before the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01145"><member>Lord De Blaquiere</member><membercontribution> observed, that if it was meant to discuss this question upon any supposition that the two countries, Ireland and England, were in the same situation, gent. were grossly mistaken indeed. The hon. gent. who had just sat down, had given to the sentiments of his
<image src="S1V0003P0I0181"/>
<col>333</col>
hon. friend, on the present state of Ireland, a construction which they would not fairly bear. They had never asserted, that the whole of Ireland was as loyal as England, but that certain provinces were so. Ulster, for instance, the inhabitants of which were certainly as well disposed to the existing govt. as those of any county in England whatever. The hon. gent. had alluded to what he was pleased to term the precipitation with which the bill for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland was carried through parliament in July 1803. He would just recal the attention of the house to the circumstances of the time. Antecedently to that period, application had been made to govt. requesting, for the security of the well-affected, that a suspension of the Habeas Corpus might be procured; but the ministry, actuated by motives of forbearance, he supposed, or not aware of the extent of the danger, refused their concurrence. What followed? The rebellion. In the mean time, the govt. having become sensible of the necessity of the measure, brought forward the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, and obtained for it the sanction of parliament; but it was too late. He was convinced, and knew it to be the opinion of many gent. intimately acquainted with the internal politics of that country, that had the suspension taken place sooner, the rebellion would never have burst forth. It was infinitely better to prevent guilt than to punish it. He was desirous, by repressing the treasonable attempts of the turbulent and factious part of the community in Ireland, to secure to the loyal and well-affected the enjoyment of security and repose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01146"><member>Mr. Sheridan</member><membercontribution> said, he should reserve the full declaration of his sentiments upon the subject before the house for a future stage of the proceeding. He rose only to correct a mistake into which his hon. friend (Mr. Fox) had fallen, in supposing that he had ever supported such a measure as that which was then under discussion. This mistake of his hon. friend arose from this, that upon the motion for an address to his majesty, in answer to his message respecting the riot in Dublin, he spoke against any delay in expressing the abhorrence which the house felt against such atrocities as that message referred to, but he never voted for either the martial law bill, or the act for the suspension of thy Habeas Corpus.</membercontribution></p>
<col>334</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01147"><member>Mr. Alexander</member><membercontribution> was surprised that any gent. should assert, that there existed no cause in Ireland for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. He believed, that in the north of Ireland the people were, in general, loyal; but disaffection still lurked among them, and if not kept down by the strong hand of power, would soon become too formidable for opposition. An hon. gent. had alluded to the period of history, during the reigns of the earlier princes of the Brunswick family, when the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act first took place, and had compared that epoch to the present; but he did not think the resemblance so strong as the hon. gent. seemed to imagine. At that time the jacobites were contending for the restoration of the Stewarts to the thrones both of G. Brit. and Ireland. They had no common object in view. Now, the exertions of the Irish malcontents are directed to separate Ireland from G. Brit. and to establish in the former country a distinct and independent democracy. The part of Ireland which he had the honour to represent, was in a quiescent state; but he was satisfied that his constituents, although they laboured under no necessity of availing themselves of the suspension, would heartily rejoice at the security that it would afford to such of their neighbours as were not in such an enviable situation. It was a circumstance too well authenticated to admit of the least doubt, that to every point of France that is easily accessible from Ireland, numbers are continually passing, whose object was surely questionable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01148"><member>Sir John Newport</member><membercontribution> explained. He had never, in the most distant manner, intimated that he should ultimately oppose the suspension. What he contended for was, that by appointing a committee, the house might be enabled to ascertain with precision, whether such a measure was eligible or not.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01149"><member>Mr. R. Martin (of Galway)</member><membercontribution> said, he would trouble the house with an observation or two, which he would comprise in a few words. If it had been proposed to him to give a decided affirmative or a decided negative to the motion for the suspension of the Habeas Corpus, he should certainly, with the knowledge of the circumstances of Ireland that he possessed, have preferred the former; but as a middle course had been offered to the house by the motion of an hon. bart. which went
<image src="S1V0003P0I0182"/>
<col>335</col>
to give them full information on the subject, he should most assuredly vote for the amendment. He differed materially from the hon. gent. who thought the situation of Ireland now the same as when the suspension of the Habeas Corpus had been voted by a parliament sitting in Ireland. To suppose this, would be to believe every argument that he had heard in favour of the union. No man was more disposed to pronounce an eulogy on that measure than he was; he had urged to his constituents, in the strongest terms, the full benefit which they would receive from a participation in the English constitution; but if a suspension were thus to take place on light grounds, or at any rate without serious inquiry, they would be apt to imagine that the benefits they derived from their close connection with England and English laws were not so great as he had represented them to be. There was another argument which appeared to him of some importance, and that was, that the suspension was confined to Ireland. If it were proposed to be extended over the whole kingdom he, for one, would make no opposition to it. It had been said, but without a shadow of truth, that the Irish gentry loved martial law better than magna charta.&#x2014;With regard to France, the situation of Ireland was essentially different from what it was at the time of the suspension that he had last alluded to. When the suspension took place, there was an organised republic existing in Ireland, and ready to fraternize with the then democratical govt. of France; but from the late change in the legislature and govt. of that country, all hopes of co-operation and assistance in their political views, that the republicans of Ireland might once have indulged, must long have vanished. If any living characters were more detested by the Irish than others, they were the individuals composing the self-denominated Irish directory in Paris. On a review of all the circumstances of the case, he certainly thought the hon. baronet's amendment should be adopted. He by no means refused the suspension, he only asked for the inquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01150"><member>Mr. Dawson</member><membercontribution> could not suffer this question to come to a decision without declaring his hostility to the original motion, and his reasons for supporting the amendment of the hon. baronet. He was confident the right hon. baronet who had brought forward the original motion had
<col>336</col>
sufficient grounds in his own mind to justify the adoption of such a measure; and he believed too, that if he were himself acquainted with these grounds, he should be of the same opinion. In order to justify him in voting for such a motion, something more was necessary than the impressions of his own mind. If the hon. baronet even had communicated to him satisfactory reasons for the adoption of the measure, in his closet, yet, as a representative of the Irish people, he should require further information&#x2014;public and official documents, sufficient to establish parliamentary ground for the necessity of the measure. Until such documents should be produced he could not reconcile it to himself to vote for a measure that was to deprive so great a proportion of his maj.'s subjects of the most invaluable benefits of the constitution. As to what had been said respecting the character of the noble lord at the head of the Irish govt. he readily subscribed to it all, and he was happy in the opportunity of bearing testimony of the high opinion he entertained of his virtues and talents: but he was far from thinking that any circumstances of personal character, however favourable, could constitute an argument in support of such a measure.&#x2014;The question was then loudly called for, and the gallery being cleared, a division took place:</membercontribution></p>

business of the day, there was a motion with which he meant to trouble their ldps. of which he had not deemed it necessary to give any notice, as he could not conceive any objection which could be made to it. What he wished was, a copy of the commission granted by his maj. to sir C. Middleton, and others, for managing the naval concerns of the country. Their Ldps. were not ignorant that there was another committee appointed for this purpose by parliament, and it was but proper that it should be seen how far this committee, appointed by his maj. was intended to supersede the committee appointed by parliament. Of the exertions of this latter committee, and of the benefits of which, their exertions had been productive to the country, both that house and the country, in general were sensible. It had been appointed under the management of a noble earl, (St. Vincent) whose conduct entitled him to public esteem and gratitude, not as a brave commander merely, but as an upright and able conductor of the affairs of the admiralty. He therefore moved, that an humble address be presented to his maj. praying that he would be graciously pleased to order a copy of the commission to Sir C. Middleton, and others, to be laid before the house. Ordered.</membercontribution></p>

He believed he had some firm friends upon that bench; and he implored them, as the greatest mark of friendship they could confer on him, to furnish an opportunity to disclose the source and spring of every action of his life, public and private; more especially those which governed his conduct as first lord of the admiralty.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[WAR WITH SPAIN.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01158"><member>Lord Mulgrave</member><membercontribution> moved the order of the day for taking into consideration the papers relative to the discussion with Spain, and also the additional papers, presented on the 2d, 4th, and 6th days of February, copies of which will be found in p. 61, 171, 229, and 291 of this volume. His ldp. said, that in laying the different papers and documents before their ldps. from time to time, he had been guided by a sincere and anxious wish to have that house as fully and completely informed upon the subject, in every respect, as the other house of parliament. He wished to call the attention of the house to this point, merely with a view to impress their ldps. with the conviction that whatever difference of opinion might possibly exist as to the subject in general, or any of its parts, there existed no desire, on the part of his maj.'s ministers in that house, to conceal or withhold any information whatever, which it was safe or practicable to lay before parliament. With respect to the general subject which they were about to consider, he was fully sensible of its importance and magnitude, and he trusted it would fully appear, on due enquiry and investigation, that the state in which this country is now placed, with respect to Spain, was not in the smallest degree desired, sought for, or still less provoked by any conduct on the part of his maj.'s govt.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0184"/>
<col>339</col>
One of the first considerations which naturally presented itself, in viewing the question, and one upon which much of its merits depended, was the stipulations of the treaty between France and Spain, concluded at St. Ildefonso, On this document, great stress was naturally kid, and, in appreciating its merits, comparisons were entered into between it and the treaty concluded between the French and Spanish branches of the house of Bourbon, in 1761, known by the appellation of the Family Compact. However, he thought the fair result of a comparison between these treaties would be very different from certain con elusions which had been drawn. The Family Compact paid due regard to that general principle of the law of nations, which dictates a relative equal stipulation between the parties; a treaty constituted otherwise, one wherein the stronger power dictates to the weaker, militates against the law of nations; it goes to deprive the weaker power of its sovereignty, and identifies it at once with the more powerful party. His Idp. then recapitulated some of the leading stipulations of the treaties adverted to, and contended, that in the family compact, the relative power and the resources of Spain were duly attended to, while, in that of St. Ildefonso, a very different ratio was observed, even to the exaction of the whole force of the country, though the object of the war should not respect the interests of the nation required. Such a treaty of alliance prevailed between France and Spain at the time of the rupture between G. Britain and the former, and in considering the question between her and the latter, that circumstance was of material importance. With respect to this, as well as to every other part of the subject, their ldps, may see, from a reference to the documents before them, that the most anxious desire existed with his maj.'s govt. to preserve the relations of peace with Spain, and this was uniformly, as appeared by the instructions transmitted from time to time to Mr. l there, the case, whatever changes might have taken place in his maj.'s councils, until, from the conduct of the Spanish govt. a state of war became unavoidable. In endeavouring to this effect, it was deemed proper to ascertain the impressions which the treaty of St. Ildefonso had made, und how far the Spanish govt. felt itself obliged to adhere to the letter of its stipulations, if called upon. Accordingly, instructions in that
<col>340</col>
spirit were sent to the British minister at Madrid, who was, however, impressed with the like considerations, and had, previously to their arrival, acted upon them. His ldp. here made frequent references to the relevant parts of the documents, particularly to the results of Mr. Frere's various conferences with the prince of peace (the real governor of that country) upon the subject. He considered the answers given by the prince on the occasion, as perplexing and inconclusive; notwithstanding the conduct of the govt. of this country was, as upon a former occasion, equally moderate and dignified; every thing was done to avoid the extremity of war, which could be effected consistently with the honour, the interests, and safety of this country.&#x2014;The next prominent consideration, to which the noble sec. of state adverted, arose from the proposal on the part of France, to march a large body of troops through Spain, the remonstrance against which, equally spirited and moderate, appeared to be attended with some effect. With regard to the important considerations of the naval armaments, and the sale of prizes, the conduct of the Brit, govt. guided by the same spirit, was equally moderate and firm. With respect to the required contingent of furnishing the stipulated number of ships of the line, the forbearance of the British govt. was, under the existing circumstances, far more moderate than it otherwise might be, as the French govt. were occupied almost solely with a particular project against this country, viz. its invasion by means of flotillas, Sic, Another light in which our forbearance at the time was to be viewed, was the. interest and security of our ancient ally Portugal; we warded off the danger from that quarter, as long as it was practicable. In considering this part of the subject, the noble sec. made frequent references to the progress of the negotiation; the spirit and perseverance of the Brit. govt. blended at the same time with a due degree of moderation and forbearance, appeared to be the cause of substituting a pecuniary supply for the contingent stipulated by the treaty. The diplomatic transactions with the Spanish govt. then wore a different complexion; it became expedient to as certain the amount of the proposed subsidies, and a comparative calculation thereof, with the probable expences of the contingent, if furnished in kind; this was entered into by his ldp. for the informa-

<col>341</col>
tion of the house, as well as a detail of that part of the correspondence, He adverted to the perseverance of the British govt. in their system of moderation and forbearance, with respect to this part of the transactions, which was manifested by its acquiescence in the payment of the subsidy, so-long as it could be considered as a temporary measure. The comparative calculations to which he referred, were necessary to refute the assertions of the Spanish govt. that the subsidy was less advantageous to France than would be the furnishing the contingent. His statements were drawn chiefly from what had been estimated as the value in contingent of a given number of ships of the line, and number of troops, as laid down in former treaties of contribution. He particularly recurred to that between G. Britain and Holland in 1788, the result of which was, that, with respect to the infantry, the calculation was at 10<i>l.</i> per man. An amount, referred to in the treaty of subsidy in question would cover a considerably greater number of troops than Spain possibly could supply; and, in point of fact, more than 8 times an equivalent for the number of men stipulated for in the treaty with France. Still, the system of forbearance was adhered to on the part of G. Britain. However, when the restless ambition, and domineering influence of France was considered, it became important to the British govt. not to relax in point of vigilance. This was the more necessary, as French soldiers were at the time clandestinely allowed to march through Spain, and the armaments were, to a certain extent, yet going on. At length strong remonstrances were made; and the impossibility of the British minister continuing longer at Madrid, were the naval armaments not completely stopped, was held out. In explaining this part of the transaction, several references were made to the documents, and the justifiable conduct of the Brit govt. and its minister contended for by his ldp. During these transactions, Spain might be fairly regarded as in a state of suspended hostility, and with respect to the sale of the prizes, the conduct of the Brit govt. was borne out, were it necessary to defend it by precedents or arguments drawn from analogy, by the case which occurred in America, during the diplomatic residence of Mr. Hammond. His ldp. proceeded, by a detailed exposition of the case, to refute the allegation of
<col>342</col>
the Spanish minister, that by concealing the affair of the prizes, they had considerably injured their colonial interests. Throughout the whole of this, transaction, which may in some point of view be regarded as a war of piracy, the overbearing influence of France was manifest; the firmness and moderation of the Brit, govt. were, notwithstanding, attended with effect, and the French ambassador, considering that this war of piracy benefitted only the subjects of his country, permitted M, Cevallos to concede the point.&#x2014;His ldp. repeated the observation, that the Brit. govt. were determined to persevere in their system of forbearance and moderation, as long as it could consistently or safely be done; at the same time, their vigilance and precautionary system were not suffered to relax a moment. In this spirit was the dispatch of Ld. Harrowby to Mr. Frere, wherein he instructs him to ascertain, as far as possible, the real state of the armaments in the different naval depots in Spain, as well as subsequent documents to which he particularly referred, and which evinced, not only the vigilance, but the anxiety of the British govt. to preserve the relations of amity with Spain. He pointed out the evasive conduct of the Spanish govt. particularly the allegation of M. d'Anduaga with respect to the destination of the armaments at Ferrol, namely, that they were to suppress an insurrection which had broken out in Biscay; this assertion was alledged to be made on the information conveyed by an officer, whose regiment was among the troops ordered for that purpose. But, he would ask, was such a communication to be deemed authoritative or satisfactory under the circumstances of the case? Certainly not! It was more rational to suppose other objects were in view. Nothing which sound and vigorous policy dictated was left undone by the Brit, govt. The Spanish ministers were repeatedly called upon explicitly to declare the nature and extent of their engagements with France; and at the same time, they were required to reduce their naval armaments to the state they were in at the commencement of the hostilities between G. Brit, and France. This proposition was spiritedly urged by the British blockading officer, who said, "unship your guns, and it will be considered as disarming; your lying a little farther in the road is no disarming at all." No satisfactory answer could be obtained
<image src="S1V0003P0I0186"/>
<col>343</col>
on this head. They deemed it not prudent to declare the real state of their engagements with France, and they did not dare, bona fide, to disown that the influence of the French ambassador, Bournonville, preponderated; and it was not too much to advance, that the whole was temporizing, until the arrival of their treasure. Under such circumstances, in which a system of delay and evasion on the part of Spain was apparent, G. Brit, was forced to depart from that system which, while moderation was safe, or forbearance honourable, she had scrupulously adhered to. He hoped and trusted, that the opinion which was already marked as that of the country, with respect to these transactions, would be felt in that house. He hoped and he believed, that his noble friends opposite to him were incapable of proceeding upon a false ground of opposition that night, on a question which involved the interests and the honour of their country. He trusted these grounds of opposition, if such was determined on, would be on the merits alone of the transactions themselves. There was one circumstance which he should not think it necessary at all to mention, as making no part whatever of the case, had it not been touched upon by a noble friend of his on a former night; he meant the detention of the frigates, respecting which he conceived it impossible, informed as their lordships were, to have the least dispute. They alt knew that transaction was entirely unconnected with the cause of the war; it made no part whatever of the discussion, and was not even known at Madrid, until the Brit. minister had quitted that capital. The transaction, he hesitated not to aver, was, by the law of nations, by arguments drawn from analogy, or on grounds of obvious expediency, completely justifiable. And farther, the previous relative situation of the country would have called for the proceeding. The case of 1761 afforded a parallel, but with this difference in favour of the present instance; in 176l, the whole year's treasure was in the ports of Spain: the war is now begun with the treasures of Spain at the disposal of G. Britain; and, in proof that the measure alluded to was not made a ground for the war, his ldp. made some further references to the documents. Drawing towards a conclusion, his ldp. contended, that no nation ever was placed in a state of war with such complete and accurate grounds of moderation and forbearance to
<col>344</col>
rest upon, as this country in the present instance. No proof of aggression, or ill will, could be advanced against us. Every nerve was strained by his maj.'s govt. to avert the dreadful alternative of war, and the evil day was kept off as long as possible: that nothing had been done, which could not be justified by the right the country had to defend itself was perfectly evident: he called on the house for its support. He was compelled by a sense of his duty to his country, and a perfect reliance on the justice of her cause, and on which was grounded his confidence that their lordships would unanimously concur in the address he should have the honour to propose. The noble secretary then moved an address to his maj. corresponding with, the relevant paragraph of his maj.'s speech, applauding the wisdom and justice of the measures of his maj.'s govt. in the recent transactions with Spain, and more especially that system of moderation and forbearance which characterised the whole, which was persevered in as long as the same could be done consistently with a just regard to the honour of his maj.'s crown, and the interest and welfare of his subjects, and promising the cordial support of their ldps. The address being put,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01159"><member>Earl Spencer</member><membercontribution> rose. His lordship said, he saw the matter in a light so extremely different, in almost every particular, from the noble lord who had just sat down, that he should ill discharge his duty to his sovereign and the country, did he not state some of his reasons of dissent from the address which had just been moved. Without any prefatory observations on the subject, he trusted that noble lords would believe that he would be one of the last men in that house, for the mere sake of opposition to a minister, to do any thing which could at all cast discredit on the govt. where the character of the country was so intimately concerned in the discussion. He felt, however, that he should in this case be committing the, honour and dignity of the country, were he to abstain from delivering the sentiments which occurred to him, on a fair, dispassionate, and careful examination of the materials on the table. In doing so, what appeared to him as being the most regular and parliamentary course would be to move an amendment, He could not propose to negative the address moved; by the noble lord. Having such materials; before them as were now lying on the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0187"/>
<col>345</col>
table of that house, such a line of conduct would indeed be improper. They could alone discharge their duty by laying their sentiments on this important subject before his majesty. In the first place, he felt no hesitation in saying, he most cordially acquiesced in that part of his maj.'s declaration which states, that from the first moment of the commencement of hostilities between this country arid France, justifiable grounds existed for our going to war with Spain also. On that subject he presumed to think there could not be two opinions. But if govt. thought proper to wave that right, and to enter into negotiations how far they would allow Spain to fulfil, and how far they would not allow her to fulfil her treaty with France; if they thought it prudent to wink at her supplying the enemies of this country to a certain extent, they ought clearly and explicitly to have intimated to what extent that, supply was to be countenanced, what were the specific terms of neutrality they would submit to, and none other. If they had done so, and if their conduct had been actuated by that moderation and humanity which the noble lord had stated, he should have agreed in the propriety of their conduct, he should have rejoiced that they had made every becoming effort to preserve peace. But was this really the case? Had the conduct of our govt. been characterized by humanity and moderation? All he had read on the subject, in the voluminous bodies of papers on the table, led him to form a very different opinion. He had seen nothing of firmness or consistency, nothing of moderation or humanity; their conduct was altogether made up of inanity and indecision. He should notice a few particulars, from which he was induced to draw this conclusion, and to regret, that in many respects, duplicity and want of candour had distinguished the instructions of ministers to our ambassador at Madrid, more than open and ingenuous conduct, which ought to distinguish a great nation. Mr. Frere was desired, in his instructions from govt. to get every explanation from the Spanish minister he could, but himself to give no information. The Spanish ministers, therefore, justly complained, that they did not know what he wanted. In one place he is desired to state, that the granting of pecuniary succours will be esteemed a sufficient ground of war; and immediately afterwards he is instructed to require infor-
<col>346</col>
mation on certain other points before he, gives any answer on that subject. Mr. Frere's own conduct shewed that he did not know what his instructions meant. Indeed they were so various and contradictory in themselves, that he could hardly be supposed to be able to reconcile them. There was, besides, a want of vigour and attention on the part of govt. which was truly astonishing, and was unquestionably reprehensible in the highest degree. There, appeared in the communication from ministers in this country to Mr. Frere, a chasm, at one period, from the 22d June to the 24th Nov.; again, one to a smaller extent, being from the 2d Nov. to the middle of Jan.; and a still more remarkable one from the 21st of Jan. to the 29th Sept. being a period of upwards of eight months, during which a new and important discussion was going on; one in which from its delicate nature, as embracing the alternative of peace or war, the honour and character of the country were concerned; but in which not a single line of instructions was sent from the govt. of this country to the person at Madrid, who was carrying on this important negotiation.&#x2014; The detention of the Spanish treasure ships, was also an instance of the mild measures of hostilities, adopted by the British govt. It had been attempted, but most unjustly, to assimilate it to an embargo laid oil in a port. To such a measure it had not the most distant resemblance; and before our govt. resorted to such a step it was called on by every principle of candour and good faith, and by every sentiment of honour and propriety, to give the Spanish govt. intimation that if it did not receive every information required, it was its determination to adopt a step of the kind. It was said that Mr. Frere had left Madrid before the news of their capture or detention was known there. But what did that avail? Could that circumstance render their detention lawful f Mr. Frere had never intimated to the Spanish minister that such was the intention of our govt. But what was still more remarkable, and might afford greater ground for calling the integrity of the intentions of our govt. into question, the register ships, it was well Known, were then expected. Mr. Frere, as well as every person else, must have been aware of that circumstance, and at this very period is, he found all at once using decisive language and insisting on having his pass-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0188"/>
<col>347</col>
ports.&#x2014;His ldp. after noticing several other topics, in which be animadverted on the conduct of his maj.'s ministers, from the commencement of the negotiation, to the actual exercise of hostilities, concluded by moving an amendment similar to the one moved this day in the House of Commons by Mr. Grey, to which we refer the reader. The original motion for the address, and the proposed amendment having been put from the woolsack.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01160"><member>Lord Sidmouth</member><membercontribution> rose, for the purpose of supporting the address. The noble viscount said, that he saw no difficulty whatever in justifying the grounds of the war. With respect to that part of the papers now before parliament which more immediately referred to his own conduct while in power, and that of those who acted with him, he found it needless to go into any length of discussion. As to the grounds of the war, he had no hesitation in saying, that if ever there was a time when the policy and necessity of a war were justifiable, it was the present. The govt. of this country had acquitted itself with great propriety and great honour on the occasion. He rejoiced in that system of patience and forbearance which had been adopted by the British govt. from the very commencement of the discussion between the two courts till the rupture which followed. At no period of his life did he feel more satisfaction than at that in which he spoke; because he could conscientiously support those measures which reflected so much honour on the liberality of this country. Our govt. had not only discharged its duty to the public with great fidelity, but had taken special care that we should not injure the interests of our old and faithful ally, Portugal, in the discussion which had engaged the attention of the ministers-of the two countries. The system of patience and forbearance which had distinguished our proceedings towards Spain, was so connected with the safety and happiness of Portugal, that our ministers were under the absolute necessity of acting with the greatest delicacy, watchful at the same time of our national honour. They had triumphed in the result. If that system was commendable and wise in policy towards Spain, how much more was it in preserving our interests with Portugal, by preventing an immediate rupture between the latter and France! But the period had not then arrived when France was to force Spain to break its neutrality, and therefore the latter was allowed to conduct it-
<col>348</col>
self towards us with apparent friendship.&#x2014;No vindication, his ldp. thought, was requisite for the part which he and his colleagues had acted at the commencement of the discussion or negotiation; neither was there any particular necessity for vindicating the measures which had been pursued by their successors in office. He would, however, with the permission of their ldps. merely refer the house to the first letter of his noble friend (Hawkesbury) dated 2d June, 1803, in which his ldp. lays down the line of conduct to be then adopted by Mr. Frere. In that letter his noble friend strongly recommends the greatest respect to the system of neutrality then apparently resolved on by the Spanish govt.; he states, that it was his maj.'s earnest desire, that the system of neutrality which. had been begun by Spain, should be strictly maintained. Lord Hawkesbury, in that very letter, says, "you will therefore endeavour by all means in your power, to impress upon the Spanish ministers the expediency of their adopting this system; and you will assure them, that if it be adopted, his maj. will respect it with the most scrupulous good faith." Another particular passage corrobated the sentiments and policy of our govt. in the most incontrovertible manner. His noble friend (Hawkesbury) in the letter now alluded to, advises Mr. Frere in these words, if the Spanish govt. should state to you, that they conceive themselves to be under the obligation to furnish to France the number of troop's and ships which are stipulated in the treaty (of St. Ildefonso, 19th Aug. 1796,) but that their co-operation will extend no farther, you will refrain from giving any opinion upon this measure, but will content yourself in signifying that you will transmit the information of it to your court." He rejoiced that the same system had been pursued afterwards by our govt,; and that as no contradiction of these instructions had ever been recommended, it was but fair and just to conclude that the same plan of policy had invariably been adopted. But while his noble friend conducted himself with such wisdom, it appears that he acted with great precaution towards our national interest and honour. In another part of the same letter he advises Mr. Frere in these terms, "you will, however, watch, with the most unremitting vigilance, the progress of any preparations which may be made for carrying it (the military contingent) into execution; and you will from
<image src="S1V0003P0I0189"/>
<col>349</col>
time to time transmit such intelligence as you may be able to acquire upon the subject to the commanders of his maj.'s ships," &amp;c. Thus we find every effort made to preserve a good understanding between the two countries, while at the same time we were vigilant that no impropriety should be committed so as to endanger our peace without a knowledge of it communicated to our govt.&#x2014;The noble viscount afterwards continued to review farther the measures which had been adopted while he and his colleagues were in power, and compared them in a cursory manner with those which had been pursued by their successors. From every view of the business, from first to last, he saw nothing to condemn but much to praise. The system of forbearance which we had displayed with such dignity to ourselves and such benefit to Portugal, his Idp. considered with much satisfaction and pleasure. The noble earl had dwelt upon that want of decision on the part of the British govt. which he was pleased to censure, as weak and inefficient. It was, however, part of that system which he had now taken the liberty of praising, and which was so honourable to the British govt. So far, therefore, was his Idp. from entertaining such an opinion, that his sentiments were diametrically opposite to those of the noble earl. The noble viscount again rejoiced in the tardiness evinced by the British govt. because it proved how averse we always had been to force Spain into the war. He had no doubt but that the Spanish govt. notwithstanding its avowed hostility, was sensible of our patience and forbearance; and, on that account, was certainly a very unwilling coadjutor in the present war. The noble earl had adverted to a letter, dated 13th Dec. 1803, in which Mr. Frere particularly notices the very delicate situation in which he was in with regard to the conduct of Spain, which had then assumed an aspect of hostility, contrary to the conditions understood between the two countries. A reference to that letter was unfortunate for the noble earl's argument; for it proved what he (lord Sidmouth) had already maintained, that our govt. had allowed that of Spain to assume an unfriendly appearance without availing itself of it as aground for an immediate cause of war. After stating the usual professions of friendship between the two countries, Mr. Frere, in the letter to M. Cevallos of the 13th Dec. mentions that he had then found it expedient to recur
<col>350</col>
to the conditions understood between the two countries, viz. in the first place, that Spain was bound to maintain a system of absolute neutrality; and, secondly, to cause it to be respected by other belligerent powers, He represented to the Spanish court, that his Brit. maj. perfectly sensible of the difficulties in which Spam was placed, as well by reason of her antient ties with France, as on account of the character and habitual conduct of that power, and of her chief, was inclined to pass over in silence several acts which, ought strictly speaking, to require explanation. Mr. Frere then also stated, that "this consideration would induce his maj. to act with forbearance to a certain degree, and particularly to overlook such pecuniary sacrifices as should not be of sufficient magnitude to force attention on account of their political effects. But it is expressly enjoined rue to declare to your excl. that pecuniary advances, such as are stipulated in the convention recently concluded with France, cannot be considered by the British govt. but as a-war subsidy." This declaration was certainly sufficiently indicative of our sentiments, and deserved the most serious attention on the part of the Spanish govt. Still Mr. Frere was to avoid any hostile measure, provided a satisfactory explanation were given. From these testimonies of our good conduct towards Spain, then, there was a presumption, that we hail done every thing which could be done to avoid the consequence of hostilities. The noble viscount then affirmed, that there were many instances in which the conduct of Spain would have served as just grounds of war, had the British govt. not wished to have avoided such a disagreeable alternative. The noble earl had dwelt with some sarcasm on what he was pleased to term "the mild measures of hostilities" adopted by the British govt. in the attack and capture of the Spanish ships, and the destruction of one of them. He wished, however, to charge the noble earl's memory with the recollection of a similar plan of policy, when the noble earl was at the head of the admiralty. An order to a similar effect was issued by him, and acted upon. The Dutch ships before any hostilities had been declared between the two countries, were detained, and several of them sunk in being compelled to keep up with the convoy by which they had been detained. The detention of the Spanish frigates, therefore, was not a solitary precedent, but one of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0190"/>
<col>351</col>
which there were frequent examples in the naval practice of the country. I am sorry, said the noble viscount, to trespass so much upon your ldp.'s attention, but considering the share I have had in the negotiation, I thought myself called upon to reply at considerable length to the observations of the noble earl who has moved the amendment. If, my lords, as I have said before, there was ever a justifiable cause of war, a cause which could scarcely admit of a doubt, much more a difference of opinion, it will be found in the conduct of Spain. To no representation which had been made to the court of Madrid, excepting that respecting the sale of prizes, has the smallest attention been paid. Spain was required to discontinue her armaments; this she did not do. She was required to communicate the terms of that convention which she had last entered into with France; this she either evaded, or when strongly pressed to it, peremptorily refused to do. She was required, not to permit the entrance of French troops into her territory; in defiance of this, the French ships of war, which were blockaded in the port of Ferrol, were recruited through Spain, and enabled, by the reinforcements so obtained, to contend with the squadron by which that harbour was observed. I will, notwithstanding the immense difference of opinion between the noble lord and me, admit that it is difficult not to agree with him in this one point, that the detention of the Spanish ships could not be well considered as other than as an act of hostility. There is, however, strong ground, my lords, upon which that act can be justified. The time was, or had nearly arrived, when France would no longer suffer Spain to enjoy the advantages of that neutrality, which, upon certain conditions, his maj.'s ministers were disposed to admit. No, my lords, that would by no means suit with the ambitious views of that power; her own means being crippled or exhausted, she wanted to possess herself of the naval power of Spain, and she was seeking for pretexts to seize it, when she found that her neutrality would be no longer beneficial to her. My lords, I lament that the noble earl has stigmatized the causes of the war in the manner he has done. The people of this country will not exert themselves in the manner that their spirit and loyalty would induce them to do, if they are not persuaded of the justice of the war; they have moral feelings, and those feelings must be con-
<col>352</col>
sulted and satisfied, before the government can expect to derive the full effect of their zeal and patriotism. I shall therefore, my lords, oppose the amendment' of the noble earl, which goes in my mind materially to clog the war. It would be in vain to say, that we either support his majesty, or the cause in which he is engaged, by adopting it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01161"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> contended that the principles on which this discussion with Spain had been conducted were inconsistent and contradictory. The forbearance that had been exercised at the beginning of it ill accorded with the system of hostility that succeeded. Ministers denied the existence of any convention between them and the govt. of Spain, respecting the stipulated sums that Spain was to pay to France in lieu of contingents; but even from their own statements it was impossible not to discover some sort of agreement or understanding. Without gross misrepresentation, it could hot be denied, that satisfaction, was obtained on the principal points that were at issue. The noble lord's instructions shewed that he had obtained satisfaction from some quarter. If he was satisfied, why did he not inform Mr. Frere so? or if not satisfied, why did he not press that gentleman to get farther satisfaction? But the noble lord had perhaps been busy with the volunteer bill when he should have been attending to his foreign relations. The noble lord then at-temped to account for the activity exhibited so lately in that department. The present ministers had declaimed against the former for their want of energy, and they wished, perhaps, to shew that they had more spirit, and as they could make no impression on France they made Spain the object of their aggression. The noble lord then contended, that before any re-monstrances could have arrived in Spain, even before they had been dispatched from this country, acts had been committed that amounted to war, and this had been done without any explanation. And this act of hostility was not a precaution for the purpose of preventing troops being sent to Ferrol, which had been complained of, but a precaution taken to prevent a subsidy to France, to which they seemed to have made no positive objection. They had not taken measures to secure Portugal previous to breaking with Spain, nor were we now in a situation to protect her. Nor were we. able, he thought, to make any impression or the Spanish settlements of America,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0191"/>
<col>353</col>
which with some might be thought a principal motive for the war, and even if we were he would disapprove, he said, of such a measure. It would only be multiplying those grounds of dissension of which we had already too many. For these reasons, the noble lord flattered himself that a great part of the house would be ready to give their concurrence to the amendment proposed by the noble earl.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01162"><member>The Earl of Westmoreland</member><membercontribution> contended, that the system of forbearance pursued by his maj.'s ministers in the early period of this business, was justified by our own situation, and by that of Europe. Spain had also held out some hopes that she might not be entirely subservient to the views of France. From reasons of policy also he justified the subsequent conduct of govt. Were they blamed because they had made no previous declaration of war? this conduct, the noble lord argued, was not unprecedented. It was thus that the Spanish armada had attacked our shores, and it Was thus that the war of the year 1756 had commenced without any previous notice. This point the noble lord farther illustrated from ancient as well as modern policy, and argued, that it was by no means inconsistent with the laws of nations. Though they had made no declaration of war, however, a dispatch had been sent intimating that their forbearance was only temporary. It was impossible for his maj.'s govt. as circumstances stood, to avoid the war: he would therefore, his lordship said, give his vote for the address.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01163"><member>Earl Darnley</member><membercontribution> maintained, that if war was commenced without any previous declaration, it ought to be on such grounds only as were clear to ourselves and to all Europe. Nothing less could justify the omission of such a formality. He reprobated the capture of the frigates, and thought it little better than a species of piracy. He contended that the sum given to France by Spain was not, contrary to what had been stated, more thin an equivalent for the stipulated contingents, of men and ships. There were strong grounds for peace, he argued, founded in policy, on account of Portugal, which was by this means, left exposed, or would be obliged to declare against us also. He had never heard the reason, he said, why other ships of war, and vessels carrying naval stores, were permitted to pass unmolested, while we had thought ourselves authorized to seize on the frigates. This circumstance-would na-
<col>354</col>
turally lead one to imagine, that the arrival of those ships had induced his maj.'s govt. to commence hostilities. His ldp. concluded with observing, that we had the misfortune to have the opinion of the rest of Europe against us.&#x2014;The house then divided on the question, "that the amendment do stand part of the motion."</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01169"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> then rose, and in a speech of considerable length, entered into an examination of the papers on the table, and of the whole conduct of ministers during the negotiation. His ldp. professed his utter astonishment that the noble lord who had risen to express his determination to oppose any motion for an adjournment, had not thought it his duty to say one word in explanation of the huge mass of papers on the table, so as to throw some light on a

<col>355</col>
transaction, which in his mind reflected no credit on the administration of which he formed a part; nay, which brought great discredit on the country itself. It was impossible to conceive any thing more extraordinary, than the conduct of his maj.'s ministers had been in the whole of the negotiation, if they were to judge from the documents that had been laid before them; for though paper was heaped on paper, and they had deliveries after deliveries, there was no communication made by which they could learn the motives of govt. in this most important and calamitous affair. There appeared nothing but negligence, inattention, and mystery. For the whole course of 18 months that this negotiation had lasted, there appeared but four dispatches from ministers to Mr. Frere, at Madrid; and even these were distinguished only by their containing nothing to the purpose, or by being unintelligible, or contradictory. The noble lord opposite to him had thrown out a challenge that no charge could be brought against ministers for their conduct in this negotiation; he accepted the challenge, and presumed to say he should prove, from their own papers, that they had been most criminally remiss, silent, and inattentive to all the eager and repeated applications which had been made to them by the Spanish govt. to explain their system; that they had even kept their own agent at the court of Madrid ignorant of their views; that they had neglected every opening that had been made them of preventing a rupture; that they had. without provocation, treated, in the first instance, with indifference and contempt the court of Spain, and when they had thus finally driven them into the hands of France that they had acted with violence, injustice, and unpardonable precipitancy. The noble lord to illustrate these points, shewed from the documents on the table, that after the commencement of the war with France, ministers had taken more than a fortnight to think of an instruction to Mr. Frere at Madrid, how to conduct himself towards that important court on that interesting emergency. Their first instruction was dated the 2d of June, and from that period no second letter was sent by them to their minister at Madrid, until the 24th of Nov. following. And this, though he repeatedly solicited them to be explicit, and urged the necessity of treating the Spanish court with care, attention, and respect. This was not all. The Spanish court was most desirous of coming to a good un-
<col>356</col>
derstanding with England, and made the most earnest applications for that purpose; No answer whatever was given to these ref peated invitations to an amicable negotiation. Though goaded by the French govt. and in the most anxious state of suspense, they could not obtain from our ministers any other treatment than that of silent contempt. In this way the months of June, July, and Aug. passed, without the slightest attention by ministers to their applications, and even to the letters and instances of their own minister resident there. Although he informed them that, at that time, the cause of England was then popular with all ranks of people in Spain; that they were most desirous of connecting themselves with G. Brit, as the means of keeping them out of the hands of France; and that the moment was most favourable for that purpose. All this was neglected, and, at length, driven by the criminal neglect and silence of England, the Spanish govt. was forced to yield to the influence of France, and. agree to permit a small body of 1,500 men to march through Spain to recruit their ships at Ferrol. This fact Mr. Frere transmitted oh the 12th of Sept. and stated. the remonstrance which he had made of his own head, on the subject. Notwithstanding this, it was not till the 24th of Nov. that he received an instruction on the subject; and then Mr. Frere being at length relieved in some; soft from the painful ignorance and nullity in which he had been kept, thanked ministers most gratefully for telling him what he was to do.&#x2014;The noble baron displayed, in strong colours, the indecision, and weakness of the whole system of the few instructions which appeared in the immense space of time that elapsed, which he described as "<i>Yari nantes in gurgite vasto.</i>" In no one instance had ministers given Mr. Frere plain, intellible grounds to act upon. In the first dispatch of his noble friend, he not only avoids giving any opinion himself respecting the contingent to be furnished to France, but he absolutely prohibits the English charge d'affaires at the Spanish court from giving any; or in other words, he sends him instructions to negotiate, and prohibits him at the same from going into the particulars of negotiation. If noble lords would cast their eyes over the correspondence, they would clearly perceive, that a mutual distrust had taken place between the Spanish minister and Mr. Frere. The latter in his letter says, that there were all good dispositions on the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0193"/>
<col>357</col>
part of the Spanish govt.; he states the subject of his conversation with the prince of peace, from which it was apparent, that he was afraid to make an opening to us until we had made one to him. This was surely a case which it was natural to suppose would elicit some fresh instructions from his maj.'s ministers; quite the contrary; from any thing that appeared in the correspondence on the table, it passed without a single observation on their part. Mr. Frere then goes on to state how popular the English govt. and character was with the king of Spain, the nobility, the government, the mercantile body, nay even with the mob, and that this happy disposition was only to be maintained by a system of conciliation. This, one would have thought, should have produced something; he such thing; even the Spanish minister here was treated with a degree of disrespect, as far as not paying any attention to his representations, that no gentleman should experience. The offer of the king of Spain to mediate was, it would appear, treated with total contempt and indifference, and during all the time that those conferences took place, France had not negotiated. Had the English minister been authorised to have met the Spanish govt. France might have been anticipated, and not suffered to negotiate, as she did in the sequel, upon her own grounds. The conference with the prince of peace had this singularity in it, that to all the overtures made by him, Mr. Frere, in consequence of peremptory instructions from his court, declined answering any one of them; he says "my mouth is shut, I can neither converse with you in mj own name, nor in that of my government." He would put it to the noble viscount (Sid-mouth) how, if the case were reversed, he would have endured such treatment. Well might the charges of indecision and incapacity have been brought against the govt. Time, it was said, waited for no man; opportunity, it may be as truly said., waited for no one; French demand and necessity could not wait for the tardy progress of negotiation.&#x2014;His lordship having' expatiated at some length, on the remissness of his maj.'s ministers with respect to the necessary instructions to Mr. Frere, proceeded to state, that the whole of that gent.'s mission, during the continuance of this negotiation, was marked by the same atyle of remissness, and that at successive periods he had been suffered to remain for 2 months, for 6 months, and even for 8
<col>358</col>
months together, without any, specific instructions from his own court how to act, but left entirely to himself; and, at one time particularly, from the 21st Jan. until the 22d of May, when the noble lord retired from the secretaryship for foreign affairs, no instructions whatever were sent to Mr. Frere; the consequence of which was, that he was treated by the Spanish ministry as a person not having the confidence of that court by whom he was accredited; and he was constantly made to feel that they had weekly communications from their minister at London, upon topics of Mr. Frere's own mission, but upon which he was totally uninformed, and thus incapacitated to maintain his station with due respect to his official character, or to act with the necessary degree of effect upon those with whom be was appointed to treat. Of the documents necessary to the information of the house upon this important subject, there was one which had been referred to, both in the notes of Mr. Frere and the chev. Cevallos, but which appeared not only to be lost but that even not one of the ministers concerned in the formation of that treaty, could remember any one article of the contents, more especially as the treaty was referred to as a convention of neutrality, both by the Spanish minister and British ambassador; but of the merits of which convention the house could, not possibly judge, unacquainted, as they were with its specific terms. So far as the documents laid before the house served to throw any light upon the subject of neutrality, as to Spain, his majesty's ministers had acted with the most shameful duplicity; for, at first, it appeared from those documents, that the treaty by which Spain agreed to supply a certain military contingent to France, in case of a war, was recognized by his maj.'s ministers. But Spain professing the most zealous wishes, to avoid every thing like hostility towards this country, by a subsequent treaty with France, had commuted her contingent in military force for one in money, to which there was apparently no objection. Shortly afterwards the specific price of respect to the neutrality of Spain, as stipulated by Mr. Frere, was the cessation of every thing like armament in any of her arsenals, preclusion to the condemnation and sale of British prizes in Spanish ports, and the same treatment to British as to French ships of war in all her harbours, and notwithstanding that all those terms were
<image src="S1V0003P0I0194"/>
<col>359</col>
strictly complied with on the part of Spain, nevertheless, the Spanish govt. is again told, that their stipulated contingent in money must not be paid to France, without leaving the British govt. perfectly at liberty to consider such payment a legitimate cause of war, whenever they should find it convenient to act thereupon. Ministers were still farther reprehensible, after circumstances of personal irritation had occurred between Mr. Frere and the person who was supposed to have the greatest weight in the councils of the Spanish govt. (the prince of peace), in having committed the remainder of the negotiation, after it became necessary for Mr. Frere to take his departure, to his brother and secretary, as charg&#x00E9; d'affaires; a gentleman certainty of whom he should never wish to be supposed as speaking otherwise than with the highest respect, and who, however highly respected in his private character in this country, yet whose official rank did not bear that high estimation in the other courts of Europe, suited to the importance of such a negotiation, but least of all others at the court of Spain. Instructions were sent to this gent, to require, on the part of the Spanish govt. not an explanation, but the declaration of a disposition to explain certain particulars with respect to the treaty last entered into with France; and in case of such declaration, that a minister properly accredited was to be sent to the Spanish court to enter into that explanation, and settle finally the question respecting the neutrality of Spain; but Mr. Frere oversteps his commission, demands the explanation himself, is refused, and takes his departure; and no accredited minister is sent to Spain to avert the consequences of this misunderstanding. Nevertheless, the Spanish minister at London, the chev, d'Anduaga, as soon as he heard of the departure of Mr. Frere from his court, waits upon the British minister for foreign affairs, is unable to see him through indisposition, addresses to him a respectful letter, signifying his readiness, notwithstanding all that has passed, to enter into negotiation, and prevent, if possible, all hostile extremities between both countries; but to this letter he never receives the slightest answer, nor even the usual attention Of ordinary civility. Such was the treatment shewn to a high-minded and most gallant nation, who plumed itself on the observance of etiquette, and whose pride was wounded by the slightest appearance
<col>360</col>
of neglect. Such was the style, of the negotiation which ministers could boast of as being free from reproach! Such was the. moderation which they bad shewn in this most delicate affair!&#x2014;But in this way was the negotiation managed until the cloud came over our heads and the thunder burst; Admiral Cochrane wrote home to say, that there were 3 ships of the line apparently fitting out in the port of Ferrol. At the same time be wrote to Mr. Frere and to the governor of Ferrol. The Spanish govt., had at once and unequivocally declared, that the sole object of this was to transport some troops to the bay of Biscay, where a rebellion had broken out; and at the same time the governor of Ferrol had said, that as it gave him uneasiness the men should be put. ashore, and sent round by land, however inconvenient. Admiral Cochrane was not content with this, but said he should insist on receiving a detailed account of their being dismantled. The noble baron intreated noble lords to make this case their own, and say what their feelings would be if such language were used to a British admiral commanding at Portsmouth, because he had chosen to send troops round the coast in a few ships of the line? Such was the commencement of our violence; and though a satisfactory answer, as he thought, was given, (for he sincerely believed that they had no object in putting some few men and provisions on board these 3 ships, but really to quell the tumult in Biscay, it being much easier to send troops by sea than through that mountainous province; at a time, too, when they were labouring under the dread of a malignant fever,) yet we proceeded to the violence of assaulting their ships on the high seas. This had been said to be no more than laying an embargo on an enemy's ships. Was there no difference between delaying merchant's ships which might be delivered back; and assaulting ships on the high seas? There was a mighty difference. Stop the ships of a merchant and they may be delivered up. Take his property and he might be indemnified. Imprison seamen and they might be discharged. But burn, sink, and blow up ship and crew, and who can restore the innocent blood which is spilt? There were some acts of hardship and severity which the laws of civilized war permitted, but this atrocious act of barbarity was contrary to all law of nations, and stamped indelible infamy on our name. The French
<image src="S1V0003P0I0195"/>
<col>361</col>
branded us with the name of a mercantile people, and said that we were ever thirsting after gold. They would therefore impute this violence to our eagerness for the dollars. Better that all the dollars, and ten times the quantity, were paid, so as it could wash away the stain which had been brought on our arms. At a time when we were armed to repel the atrocities of France, this was not a time to display such a spirit.&#x2014;His lordship shewed that the seizure of the treasure ships had no resemblance to the stoppage of the Dutch, nor to the measure recommended by the Earl of Chatham, in 176l. He deprecated the war in which this series of neglect, insolence, contempt, and violence bad plunged us. He denied that it was popular. A war with Spain, however easy ministers had shewn that it was to provoke and begin, was not so easy to get out of. If the stories that were floating were true, of desperate, mad, and romantic expeditions against Spanish America, he would prophecy, that it would be a most calamitous war to G. Britain. A more perilous, and a more calamitous adventure for the sake of mere plunder, could not be undertaken than such an expedition, either for the country that gave it birth, or for humanity in general; for while it would operate to entail misery on a great portion of the human race, it tended to exhaust the blood and treasure of this country, to disperse our naval force, to ruin our army, and be productive of the worst mischiefs to the country. The great principles which it was the duty of a wise govt. to hold up to the people of this country, were truth, justice, and moderation, and not rapacity and blood.&#x2014;His lordship, concluded a most brilliant and impressive speech by saying, that he did not rise thus to discharge his duty from any motive of wanton attack on the king's ministers, or to strive to destroy their popularity, but from a serious conviction that the war might have been prevented by common care on their part, and that as it was totally unprovoked and unnecessary, so also would it be most grievous and unfortunate to the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01170"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> said, he had purposely avoided rising earlier in the discussion; because, feeling his own official conduct deeply interested in the whole of this negotiation, he wished to bear, at length, the whole of the arguments against it, before he offered himself to the consideration
<col>362</col>
of the house. His lordship then entered very much at length in reply to the observations of the noble baron; and argued, that, however the house might be disposed to censure his maj.'s ministers, on this subject, they were bound to support his maj. in bringing the war to an honourable conclusion. He thought, from the whole conduct of Spain, as well as the. treaty of Ildefonso, by which she became, <i>ipso facto,</i> the offensive and defensive ally of Trance, she must be justly considered as hostile to this country, and regarded not as a neutral power, but as one against whom policy enjoined the forbearance of hostility as long as it was possible. When we entered into the present contest with France there was nothing like a continental diversion in our favour. It would have been therefore almost an act of insanity to provoke at once all the enemies of whom we had in different shades and degrees to complain. We were at all events to wait until our naval and military establishments had been raised to their proper height. Spain, in this point of view, required peculiar management; and the more so, as the safety of Portugal was involved in the issue. Here was therefore, a radical mistake on the part of the noble baron who had last spoken. He wished that every question should be so categorically put as to leave no issue but that of peace or war. This was certainly not the mode to be pursued when the great object in view was delay; a delay which might serve to enable Spain to disentangle herself from her obligation, and empower us to provide for the safety of our ally, the queen of Portugal. If these objects were held in view, he would appeal to the documents on the table, and boldly ask, whether the instructions transmitted to our minister at Madrid were not fully adequate to every emergency? There were some points on which it was impossible to give a definite instruction. It was difficult to say, for instance, whether a contingent in men or money, supplied to an enemy would be least disadvantageous. With respect to a pecuniary aid, the question was in the degree. If it surpassed the value of the military contingent, then its operation was most hostile and mischievous; but this was a point which, with all our efforts, we could not possibly ascertain.&#x2014;On one other point the noble bart. was clearly mistaken in his argument. It was true that Mr. Frere had stipulated with M. Cevallos for the cessa-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0196"/>
<col>363</col>
tion of the Spanish armaments, and for the stoppage of the condemnation and sale of prizes in the Spanish ports. These, however, were conditions, on the observance of which he promised to remain at Madrid; they were not, as had been wrongly supposed, conditions of neutrality, or binding as such on this country. But, even supposing them to be of the latter description, the obligations had been all violated by Spain.&#x2014;The armaments in Ferrol had been lightly treated by the noble baron. But, when it was recollected, that there were four French sail of the line in that harbour, and that, by an effort of no great difficulty, a junction might be made highly dangerous to our blockading squadron, the suspicions wore a more serious aspect. As to the conveyance of troops to Biscay it was all a feint, as there was no port in that quarter where a single man could be landed. The fact was, that Spain was determined to declare war, as on every former occasion, as soon as her treasure ships were safely arrived. In the interim, the hostile mind of that country was manifested in every possible way. The permission given to French troops, sailors, and artillerymen, to march through her territory, was certainly no slight indication of hostility. This, the noble baron will probably say, is one of admiral Cochrane's stories; but if he will look into the correspondence, he will find two notes on the subject from Mr. Frere, stating the circumstances, and which are not, in any the minutest particle, disavowed. It was on these full and ample grounds that we entered on that modified hostility which is so much the ground of reproach. Why, it is said, did we not issue letters of marque and reprisal? The answer is obvious. The property of the captors it would not have been in our power to reclaim and restore, but by detaining the vessels the power of restitution was left in our hands. This was certainly an incomplete hostility; but let it be recollected, that when this was ordered, the right of full, complete, and absolute hostility, was substantially in our hands. If Spain has suffered in this instance, let it be recollected that the fault is entirely her own. Had she been capable of manly exertion in her own behalf, from us she would have found every support and assistance, But as history shews that small states have arisen to the greatest heights by industry, activity, and energy, so large empires are found to moulder
<col>364</col>
away through apathy, inertness, and pusillanimity. Our view of the question this case must be merely personal. We must not permit either the strength of one power, or the weakness of another, to be converted into a weapon for our destruction. This has been stigmatized as a mercenary war; but this proposition, said his ldp. I must deny. Wars of ambition, wars for conquest, wars for extension of territory&#x2014; all these are hateful; but a war for profit has in it something loathsome and revolting to every generous mind. The carrying the war into the Spanish Colonies, which has been thrown out this evening, had no weight whatever hi the decision of ministers. They forbore, as long as forbearance: was practicable, and they did not strike, until the blow, in their judgment, could no longer be avoided. If we could see the once great and illustrious nation of Spain rouse once more from the lassitude into which she has sunk, and display that spirit and those noble energies which once rendered her so justly renowned amongst the nations of Europe, then might we hope to see her retrieve that honourable character heretofore so justly venerated: but, sunk as she is under the vassalage and dictation of the person who now rules France, friendly to us she dare not be; neutral she cannot be; and hostile she must be, at the mandate of her ally: and, therefore, it was the duty of his maj 's ministers to be guarded against those hostilities to which from necessity or otherwise she might be disposed.</membercontribution></p>

<col>366</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01174"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> rose, and spoke as follows.&#x2014;I feel great satitfaction, sir, that the day is at length arrived when we can enter into that full and ample discussion of the papers before the house, which the magnitude of the subject requires, and though I am satisfied that a perusal of these papers, and an impartial consideration of the transactions to which they refer, would be sufficient to convince every rational mind of the rectitude of the measures pursued by his maj.'s. govt. and of the justice of the war in which we are engaged; yet, reflecting how much the complete illustration of the policy by which we have been guided, and the vindication of the steps which have been adopted, are necessary to the credit of his maj.'s govt. and to the honour of the British nation, I trust I shall be excused if I go somewhat at length into a review of the different aspects of our relations, and the progress of the discussions with Spain previous to the war. In the course of what I shall have the honour to submit to the house, I hope that I shall be able, not only to establish that which, I believe, indeed few can be now disposed to question, the ultimate justice and necessity of the war, but also, the exemplary moderation, liberality, and forbearance of the ministers of this country in every period of our relations with Spain since the breaking out of the war with France; and when unexpected circumstances required the departure from the system of lenity which it was always the desire of the Brit. govt. to exercise, that though they were not deficient in vigour to vindicate the rights, and to avenge the cause of the country, they never deviated from the laws of nations or the principles of good faith.&#x2014;In the first place then, it it is necessary to take into consideration the relative situation in which Spain stood towards this country at the breaking out of the war, in consequence of her antecedent engagements with France. I need hardly say more to characterise that situation, than barely mention the treaty of St. Ildefonso, and the stipulations it contained. Spain was bound to France by a treaty on the face of it both offensive and defensive, and, in fact, a treaty which was by the contracting parties so entitled. Besides guaranteeing neutrality, their territories, &amp;c. they agree to assist each other with 15 ships of the line, and 24,000 men: and this assistance, too, as appears from the 8th art. is to be given upon the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0198"/>
<col>367</col>
demand of the requiring party, and the demand is to be taken as conclusive evidence of the necessity, precluding the party required from making, any investigation or inquiry, as to the justice of the war, or the policy of the object for which the succours were to be granted. Nay, by the 11th art. of this treaty, the contracting parties are to-assist each other with their whole forces in case the stipulated succours should be insufficient. This treaty it is most important to keep in view, as the foundation of all the proceedings which it was thought incumbent on this govt. to adopt. The Spanish ambassador in this country, in several of the notes before the house, it will be seen, endeavours to set up his own, as appears too, in the first instance, unauthorized reasonings, to shew that this treaty was not offensive. To such reasonings I oppose the treaty itself, which expressly puts at the disposal of France the whole power and resources of the Spanish monarchy by sea and land, which strips Spain of the right to ask a question or exercise any judgment as to the purpose of the succours she is to furnish. Such a treaty, unless distinctly disclaimed, I contend must <i>ipso facto</i> have rendered Spain a principal in the war. On the face of it such is the treaty of St. Ildefonso; and if any thing were wanting to explain its tendency, it would be the example of what happened in the year 1796, in which the offensive provisions were specifically directed against England. Indeed, who that recollects the circumstances in which the treaty was concluded, and when Spain was compelled to subscribe and ratify that record of her vassalage to France, could doubt the spirit of the contract, or its hostility to the British nation? Such was the situation in which his maj.'s ministers found themselves when the aggressions and injustice of the present ruler of France forced them into the present rupture. This was the situation of the relations between both countries when his maj.'s ministers, actuated by sentiments which I cannot but applaud, resolved to delay their determination with respect to the light in which they should regard Spain, till they should see in what manner, and to what extent, Spain would be disposed to carry its observance of the terms of the treaty. In whatever light the treaty should be viewed, it could not be considered on the part of Spain, but as a reluctant tribute to the overbearing dictates of its ambitious and tyrannic, ally; yet,

whilst stipulations so directly hostile of the interests and security of this country remained in force, no man, I am confident in this house, will deny, that it could only be attributed to extreme pusillanimity on the part of his maj.'s govt. if they had not required the clear, distinct, and explicit renunciation of the offensive articles; but the feelings to which I have alluded, for the degraded and humiliating situation of that country, and which so justly influenced his maj.'s, ministers on the occasion, dictated a spirit of moderation and forbearance in the measures they adopted with respect to a court, of which, though an enemy, I am not disposed to speak with severity, at the same time that I cannot but admit that in its present state it seems to possess very little of that honourable, spirit, and those high-minded sentiments, by which the Spanish nation has been so long characterised. On this ground, I am convinced that the tenderness, moderation, and forbearance shewn by his maj.'s ministers, from the impulse of such generous sentiments, not upon any principles of true or sound policy, for the degrading situation to which necessity, not choice, had reduced Spain, will meet with the decided approbation of the house. I state this particularly, because it was, in the first instance, deemed expedient to gain time, and the Spanish court seemed as desirous to get rid of their engagements as we were to detach them from their ally. But, considering the situation in which Spain was placed, considering the situation and circumstances of Europe, considering also that the intemperate and precipitate conduct of the French ruler might compel Spain to take an active part with him in the war, the same sentiment to spare, the same generous feeling for its degraded-situation, could no longer be suffered to influence his maj.'s govt. to a perseverance in the system of moderation upon which they had hitherto acted. To act longer upon such a system, under such discouraging circumstances, would not be to give way to the influence of generous sentiments, or honourable feelings, but to enable Spain, under the dictation of France, to accumulate resources, and armies, and fleets, and arsenals, to be at the disposal of France: and for what purpose? France might at once demand the contingent of 15 sail of the line and 24,000 men; she could moreover demand, that Spain should put into activity the whole force that she
<image src="S1V0003P0I0199"/>
<col>369</col>
could command. At any moment it was in the power of France to call for the whole, cither of the treasure of Spain or of the blood of her subjects, unless the contingent succours should be deemed sufficient; and for what purpose? the purpose of aiding the French in the war against this country; for a purpose announced at the very outset of the war, continued through every stage of its progress, and never once suspended, but in practice, for the purpose of destroying the power and independence of this country; for the purpose of overthrowing this noble barrier against the encroachments of French ambition on the liberties and independence of mankind. The duties of the ministers of this country were, by all these circumstances, rendered extremely delicate and difficult. Standing at the head of the affairs of a nation like this, to be at once moderate and forbearing towards Spain, and wise and provident to G. Britain; to feel and to vindicate the justice of their cause, yet to mitigate the rigour of justice as far as true policy and the safety of the state would bear, was indeed a trying situation, and required the utmost prudence; particularly when they were sensible that Spain might be pushed on to war with us, though ruin might be the consequence to her, provided her cooperation could in any manner facilitate the projects of the ruler of France for. our destruction.&#x2014;Having stated these general principles as applicable to the state of our relations with Spain, it remains to consider how they have been followed up. Gentlemen will see in the papers on the table the instructions by lord Hawkesbury to our minister at Madrid, so far back as Oct. 1802, instructions which I am confident all must approve. They will there see that the first object of our policy was, if possible, to detach Spain from her degrading connection with France, and if that was impracticable, at least to endeavour, that in case of any future war, either a system of neutrality should be settled, or at least that hostilities with her might be deferred as long as possible. It cannot be questioned that these principles were acted upon by our minister, and that every effort was made to prepare the minds of the Spanish govt. for these alternatives. In June 1803, instructions were given to. Mr. Frere to demand from the Spanish govt. a renunciation of the treaty of St. Ildefonso, nor will any man, I believe, dispute that the instructions to which I allude, as to the points to
<col>370</col>
be insisted on, are fully justified by the laws of nations.&#x2014;It is needless for me to dwell upon the question, how far the limited succours in the treaty of St. Ildefonso would have been consistent with the neturality of Spain, as that makes he part of the case. I must say, however, that it never was admitted that we were bound to acquiesce in those succours being given; so that all argument founded upon the commutation of assistance in kind into pecuniary aid are inapplicable, because, if we did not admit the one, we were certainly no way bound to acquiesce in the other. The conduct which a nation is bound to follow in the case of limited succour furnished in pursuance of a defensive treaty must depend upon the extent of the assistance, and that extent must be taken in proportion to the whole strength and resources of the nation furnishing. Much will depend, too, upon whether the treaty is recent or ancient, whether it is general in its provisions, or concluded with direct reference to hostilities with a particular state. His maj.'s govt. at the time, wisely gave no opinion upon the question of limited succour in kind to be furnished by Spain to France, because that case did not occur. They did what was necessary for the protection of our interests, had it taken place, and the Spanish govt. were apprized that our forces would attack their auxiliary fleet* and prevent their junction with the enemy: That to do so would have been consistent with the clearest principles of the law of nations, and of self-defence, cannot admit of a dispute. But while the moderation of this country was unwilling to drive Spain into war, it was unquestionably necessary to Obtain some pledge that the treaty of lldefonso should not be acted upon. If they did hot make it a specific ground of war, they were v entitled to insist that its hostile principle should be abandoned. In the dispatches of Mr. Frere. will be found the answer which he received to the applications be had made upon this subject, and in which he stated, that unless satisfactory explanations and assurances were given, the treaty of Ildefonso could not but be regarded as hostile. It was not till Aug. that these dispatches reached this country. The answer of the prince of peace was vague and inconclusive, but still it evinced a disposition to delay, and, it possible, to elude compliance with the demands of France Much ill humour existed in the court of Madrid against the latter, and an inclina-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0200"/>
<col>371</col>
tion to resist her domination seemed to prevail; while every disposition was manifested to give satisfaction to the just representations of this govt. Things remained in this state till Sept. nor was it known here, at least, up to that time, that France had made a formal demand of the stipulated succours. At that period a note was presented by M. d'Anduaga, the Spanish minister here, in which he endeavours to prove that the treaty of St. Ildefonso contained nothing hostile to this country. And here I cannot but remark upon a whimsical circumstance in those reasonings of the Spanish ambassador. He endeavours to shew that the treaty in question was, in reality, two treaties, the one defensive, the other offensive, but applicable only to the case in which both France and Spain should, by common consent, enter into war against any other country. It so happens, however, that the first part of the treaty, which M. d'Anduaga contends to be defensive, is precisely that which contains the offensive provisions, and that part which he describes as offensive is that which is defensive. For, under the first part is included the stipulation that Spain, in case the limited succours shall be insufficient, shall put her whole forces at the disposal of France; words which M. d'Anduaga argues do not mean that Spain shall join France with all her power, though words more synonymous I do not think it would be possible to select. This, however, by the way; and now to pursue the course of the negotiation. In Sept. a dispatch was received from Mr. Frere, dated in Aug. in which he announces that France had made a formal demand of the stipulated succours. Mr. Frere was then informed by the prince of peace, that to preserve the neutrality of Spain they were willing to make a pecuniary sacrifice. The demands of France were urgent; and Mr. Frere writes, that a sum of not less than 250,000<i>l.</i> ft month, or 3,000,000<i>l.</i> a year, were the terms, and though Spain had pleaded for a decrease, it appears to have been the sum settled, and indeed rather with increase than diminution. This event, in which the influence of France over Spain was so manifest, must have led ministers to conclude, that the hopes of the neutrality of Spain would prove visionary. Mr. Frere, in dispatches, dated 12th Sept. mentions, that the Spanish govt. in answer to his remonstrances on this subject, had stated, that it was better for this country that they should
<col>372</col>
make pecuniary sacrifice to preserve their neutrality (though it appeared, from every account, that this pecuniary commutation was no less than 3,000,000<i>l.</i>) than that they should have supplied the stipulated succours in kind, and a nominal declaration of war which must have ensued. This mode of reasoning is undoubtedly absurd and ridiculous, for how could the Spanish govt. have expected that this country would have considered the declaration merely nominal, and have abstained from active hostility? But I mention this, not on this account, but to show that the Spanish govt. themselves, far from thinking even the limited succour consistent with neutrality, considered that at least a nominal declaration of war must be the inevitable consequence of supplying them. In a subsequent dispatch from Mr. Frere, dated 20th Sept. he mentions, that he had heard that the subsidy demanded by France was 700,000<i>l.</i> a year, and that this was considered too much by Spain, which of fered 600,000<i>l.</i> If then the Spanish govt. considered 700,000<i>l.</i> as excessive, is it not clear, by their own confession, that 3 millions, was infinitely more than this country was bound to consider compatible with any principle of neutrality?&#x2014;Nothing farther of importance took place in the discussion except a note, respecting the passage of French seamen to Ferrol to reinforce the crews of the fleet there, a subject on which I forbear at present to comment. On the 9th Oct. Mr. Frere writes, that the negotiation with France was concluded. Mr. Frere, however, was unable to procure any official communication of the arrangement with France, though from every in formation he could procure it amounted to 3 millions sterling a year. What we know of that convention, however, is sufficient to stamp the conduct of Spain as hostile; and the refusal of a communication of its terms, up to the very date of the rupture, was of itself sufficient to justify war. What we know, then, is itself a distinct and specific ground of war, unless it be contended, as I cannot suppose it will be in this house, that a war subsidy of 3 millions is not an infringement of neutrality, and does not render Spain a principal in the war. The Spanish govt. indeed, all along contended, that the subsidy, the extent of which they refused to communicate, was Only an equivalent for the succours stipulated; but we are not told, whether it was to be considered an equivalent for the limited, or far the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0201"/>
<col>373</col>
unlimited succours. If to the latter, nothing can be more absurd; and, if as to the former, on what principles of calculation is the equivalent estimated? Under the name of an equivalent any sum might have been paid. In different nations different estimates of that equivalent would be formed. In this country, owing to circumstances connected with our prosperity, though sometimes burdensome in their operation, the pecuniary equivalent for military aid would be higher than in any other country probably in the world. What then might be the rated equivalent in England for 15 sail of the line and 24,000 land forces? At the highest estimate the pay and charges for 15 sail of the line for a twelvemonth would not exceed one million, leaving two for the land forces. This would be allowing between 80<i>l.</i> or 90<i>l.</i> for every man. It is well known that this is infinitely beyond the allowance necessary in any service or in any treaty. Of what is allowed as pecuniary commutation for service in kind, we may take an instance from the treaty between this country and Holland in the year 1783, in which it is stipulated that between 8<i>l.</i> or 9<i>l.</i> shall be paid for each man in the infantry, and 11<i>l.</i> and 12<i>l.</i> for each man in the cavalry. By this calculation of equivalent however, Spain pays between 80<i>l.</i> and 90<i>l.</i> for each man, an allowance extravagant and unreasonable in the extreme. Can it be doubted, then, that a pecuniary subsidy, to the annual amount of 3 millions made Spain a principal in the war, and could never be considered as a fair equivalent for any moderate extent of military assistance? If this be the general principle, as it most unquestionably is, why did this govt. forbear to make it. a ground of war? I have already touched upon the reasons. They believed that Spain rather submitted to adverse circumstances, than acted from choice. They believed that she looked to circumstances that might enable her to escape from the thraldom in which she was kept, and to pursue a course more suited to her interests and to her dignity. There were, indeed, circumstances in the state of Europe known to those at the head of affairs here, circumstances on which I cannot at present enlarge, which seemed to justify the hopes which Spain was naturally supposed to entertain, and which sufficiently account for the forbearance manifested by this govt. It appearing, however, that nothing had actually been signed between France and Spain, instructions were,
<col>374</col>
on the 24th Nov. sent to Mr. Frere, in which he is authorised to declare to the Spanish govt. that the acquiescence of his maj. in the payment of a war subsidy to France could be no more than a temporary connivance; that it must depend upon the amount of that subsidy, and the disposition of Spain in other respects to maintain a strict neutrality. Mr. Frere is instructed also to protest against the measure as hostile; and that forbearance of actual war could only be continued on the expectation that the subsidy was to be temporary; and the most express reservation of our right to go war is made. The Spanish govt. received distinct notice that, should his maj. be induced to connive in the payment of a subsidy as a temporary measure, lie would naturally look with the utmost jealousy to any naval preparations in the ports of Spain, A dispatch was received from Mr. Frere on the 27th Dec. announcing that the convention between France and Spain was finally concluded on the 19th Oct. In this dispatch Mr. F. in. forms, this govt. that he had represented the convention to M. Cevallos as a war subsidy, which had given this country an undoubted right to go to war. On this occasion M. Cevallos argues that the limited succours had not been objected to, and adds that we ought not to complain of the pecuniary subsidy, because we did not know what it was. This reasoning of M. Cevallos is worthy of remark. When we urged a communication of the convention, we were told it was unnecessary, because as it was an equivalent for the succours stipulated, we must know what it was; but when we complain of this payment to France as a war subsidy, we are answered, "no, you have no reason of complaint, because you do not know what we pay." Thus, because the. Spanish govt. wrongfully refuses the communication of a treaty, in which we are directly interested, we are to have no redress, nor must we be displeased when a subsidy is paid ten times the amount of any stipulated succours in kind, had the furnishing of these been admitted, as they were not, to be sistent with neutrality. The first period of the negotiation begins with the discussions respecting the treaty of Ildefonso; the second with those respecting the con-convention of subsidy; the third era of the negotiation, commences with the instructions sent by lord Hawkesbury to Mr. Frere after that convention was known to be concluded. Lord Hawkesbury in his
<image src="S1V0003P0I0202"/>
<col>375</col>
letter of the 21st Jan. 1804, says distinctly, that the convention of the 19th Oct. was a sufficient cause of war, but that, from views of forbearance and of policy, his maj. was unwilling, yet, to act upon the right which that measure conferred, if satisfactory explanations can be obtained. Mr. Frere, therefore, was instructed to require explanations respecting the other stipulations of the convention of the 19th Oct. and, secondly, to obtain satisfaction as to naval preparations. The forbearance of ministers, therefore, is not founded either upon blindness to the danger which the future hostility of Spain, under the guidance of France, might produce, but upon motives of policy adopting due precaution against that event. Their forbearance was conditional, and it required, as a <i>sine qua non,</i> that no naval preparations should be undertaken in the Spanish ports. Without this condition the generosity and the lenity of govt. would have been criminal had there been any danger that Spain, besides contributing a pecuniary subsidy, would have made any preparations for cooperating with France whenever the moment arrived when her military aid would have been useful. When Mr. Frere received these instructions, he was engaged in a discussion respecting the sale of prizes, on which at a later period satisfaction was obtained, and also respecting armaments at Ferrol. As to these, he received assurances that no hostile armaments were going on in that port. Agreeably to his instructions, Mr. Frere proceeded to demand a communication of the convention of the 19th Oct. Now, for the first time however, the Spanish govt. began, in their turn, to demand an explanation of the intentions of G. Brit. Mr. Frere insisted, that a commuication of the convention must be made preliminary to any agreement for the neutrality of Spain. On this the prince of peace referred him to M. Cevallos, and nothing was obtained but vague assurances that the treaty contained nothing hostile to the interests of this country. The reason, however, assigned for the refusal to communicate the treaty is peculiarly deserving of attention. It is expressly said that it had been proposed to communicate it, but "general Bournonville had over ruled it;" Here is evidence incontestible of the controul exercised by the French over the Spanish govt. evidence furnished inadvertently by the latter themselves. The court of Spain admit that the demand made by
<col>376</col>
us was just; and they excuse themselves for non-compliance by ah apology, of itself highly alarming, and affording the best criterion how precarious must be the reliance on the neutrality of Spain while the ascendancy of France continued. That we had a right to the communication of a treaty in which we were so nearly interested, I believe no man will dispute. And can it be contended that we ought to have acquiesced in that refusal, without at the same time saying that we ought to abandon whatever is most essential to the assertion of our dignity, and the maintenance of our rights? In vain is it contended that the connivance of this govt. in the neutrality of Spain, was an acknowledgment of it. On the contrary, in every one of his notes and conferences Mr. Frere studiously reserved the right of this country to go to war, and accurately distinguished between temporary connivance and positive recognition. The connivance too Was conditional. It depended on the communication of the treaty with France, on the discontinuance of all naval armaments, and the prohibition of the sale of prizes in Spanish ports. That the Spanish govt. were aware that their neutrality was not recognized is obvious from the discussions which took place, and from their anxiety to learn what were our intentions. It appears that some mistake has occurred from the use of the word convention, in some of the Spanish notes, as if there had been a convention of neutrality between this country and Spain. It is plain, however, that the word refers in most cases to the convention with France, though to be sure it is not surprising it should be thought such a convention as that was, could not be meant to be characterized as a convention of neutrality. And here, sir, I may take notice of a circumstance that escaped me in a former part of my speech. Let us consider what proportion of the whole revenue of Spain the subsidy paid to France forms. It will be found, I believe, that as the whole revenue of Spain, for every purpose, is not estimated at more than 8 millions, the subsidy is, between one third and one half of its pecuniary resources. And is not that a strange sort of neutrality in which one power contributes, near a half of its whole annual revenue to another power, to carry on war against a, third? If the proportion of aid in a defensive treaty is a consideration of great importance in deciding whether it is to be
<image src="S1V0003P0I0203"/>
<col>377</col>
deemed a violation of neutrality, surely the proportion of a pecuniary commutation to the whole means of a state, is not to be held indifferent? Suppose for instance that Prussia or Austria were engaged in a war with France, would it be considered a convention of neutrality, if England were to stipulate and pay 15 millions to one of the belligerents? And 15 millions paid by England, probably forms no larger proportion of her means, than 3 millions annually paid by Spain to France&#x2014;and by a convention so ridiculously described as a convention of neutrality! It is evident, however, that M. &#x101F;Anduaga who, in a note presented to this govt. speaks of a convention of neutrality of the 19th Oct. between Spain and England, is altogether unacquainted with the progress and state of the negotiation. It is clear, that no such treaty ever did exist, for if it had, would M. Cevallos, in Feb. and March, have talked of the understanding which prevailed on the subject, if they could at once have settled the dispute by referring to the written document? But in my view of the subject, it would have been of little consequence whether such a convention had existed or not. It is manifest that it could have recognised the neutrality of Spain only conditionally, and if the condition was violated, the neutrality of course expired, and we should have been placed in the same right of war that belonged to us prior to its conclusion. But still, though ministers were disposed to prolong their forbearance and lenity, no satisfaction was obtained as to the communication of the treaty. Desirous, however, of affording every facility and removing every obstacle to an amicable arrangement, it was resolved to recal Mr. Frere, in consequence of circumstances having occurred that made it impossible for him any longer to communicate personally with the prince of peace. Upon the nature of that difference, which has no relation to the present subject, it is not necessary for me to enlarge. In justice to Mr. Frere, however, I must say, that it arose without any fault on his part, from a most unprovoked, unwarrantable conduct in that person, who, though without ostensible office, is known to have the most leading influence in the councils of Spain. Nevertheless, much as ministers respected the talents and were sensible of the services of that gent, who had so ably filled the place of ambassador JO the court of Madrid, during a difficult
<col>378</col>
and critical period, they were determined that no collateral obstacles should stand in the way of a friendly termination of discussions, in which the public interest was so much concerned. They had reasons of policy for not driving matters precipitately to extremity, and reserving the right of war should circumstances demand its exercise; they continued to leave an opening for conciliation and arrangement. It was intended to send another gentleman to succeed Mr. Frere, the latter returning home on leave of absence. The same vessel, however, which brought Mr. Frere home on the 17th Sept. brought letters from admiral Cochrane, which proved in, the clearest manner the violation of that condition, on which the forbearance of his maj.'s govt. had particularly been founded. That the clear, and precise information communicated by adm. Cochrane, proved, that a violation of the condition on which the neutrality of Spain was connived at, had been committed by the armaments in the port of Ferrol, and that it was incumbent on govt. to act upon it, I think cannot be denied. The dispatches of adm., Cochrane pointed out many important facts. The preparations in the port of Spain were coir lateral with the equipment of the French squadron and the Dutch men of war; they happened at the moment when French sailors and soldiers were conveyed through Spain to reinforce the crews of the French ships; the packets were armed as in time of war. After our forbearance, so long founded on the express condition, that no armaments were to be undertaken in the Spanish ports, could the govt. of this country shut its eyes to an armament begun in circumstances so suspicious, or ought they to have so far forgot their duty as to neglect the precautions which the case demanded? After Spain had been warned in what light an armament would be viewed, and of the consequences to which it would lead, what would have been thought of the vigour or good sense of ministers had they, on this occasion, taken no steps inconsequence of such information? What would have been said if the enemy, joining their forces, had came out of Ferrol and proved too strong for the squadron under adm. Cochrane, though that I do not believe, notwithstanding any difference of numerical strength, would have happened? What would have been said if the treasure ships had arrived safe, and replenished with dollars the coffers of Spain, to be
<image src="S1V0003P0I0204"/>
<col>379</col>
placed at the disposal of France, and employed for our destruction? What would hare been said had the Ferrol squadron proceeded to any enterprise that would either have struck a blow at our interests, or facilitated those plans which the enemy meditated against this country? If any of these things had happened, what defence could ministers urge this day for their negligence, their weakness, and their pusillanimity? I believe they would have been universally and deservedly condemned, not only at home, but in every quarter of Europe and the world, where honourable, sound, and patriotic principles have still any influence on the views, wishes, and sentiments of mankind. I cannot believe that any man in this nation, would ever have thought otherwise, than with horror and detestation of the continuance of forbearance in such a posture of affairs; but if, contrary to my belief, there were majorities to applaud forbearance, I declare to you, sir, and to this house, that there is no censure which I should not be proud to receive, rather than the praise of men, who could applaud such forbearance, or could even praise hesitation at a moment, such as that of the receipt in this country of the decisive, and positive, and most unequivocal intelligence from admiral Cochrane, of the armaments in the ports of Spain. Men might argue, however, that the intelligence itself was not of such a nature, as that a wise and reflective govt. ought to have adopted it, so as to determine them to take measures of precaution, indicative of ultimate war. I know the intelligence has been questioned; but I do also know, that it has been questioned without cause. All the circumstances that have come within my knowledge, only confirm the truth and accuracy of that intelligence, beyond the possibility of doubt. The single thing against it, to which weight is attached, is that of the circumstance of apiece of news, given by M. &#x101F;Anduaga, in one of his notes, the last indeed to the British govt. M. &#x101F;Anduaga, when first he received the intelligence of the seizure of the frigates of his nation, addressed a note to the secretary of state for foreign affairs, in which he states, that a colonel of the regiment of Hibernia, had received letters from some officers of his regiment at Ferrol, stating, that the armament preparing in that harbour, of which his regiment was part, was destined to go against the insurgents in Biscay. I do not know
<col>380</col>
what gentlemen think of such information, I will not disparage the authors of it; but most certainly I am of opinion that information from a British admiral is higher authority than the information from the Hibernian colonel. As to the assemblage and arming at Ferrol, it is more probable* however, that they were originally intended for a. secret expedition of some sort, but that" when it became known that. Biscay was in a disturbed state, as the troops could not be spared for a secret expedition, they were ordered to be landed, and received a destination altogether remote from that which was assigned them under the plan which had led to their assemblage. If it was otherwise, it never occured to the governor of Gallicia to tell admiral Cochrane, when this officer wrote to him for explanation, that the armament at Ferrol was destined to act against the Biscayans. The evidence of the governor of Gallicia, set against that of the correspondent of the Hibernian colonel, would surely weigh somewhat in the minds of gentlemen. If the information of the colonel had any effect at all, it must have been on the English newspapers, or on some persons out of the govt. On this subject, the evidence of the governor of Gallicia is conclusive. This person, in answer to the first letter of admiral Cochrane, demanding explanations of the armaments in the ports of Ferrol, replies that it was an arming of some vessels for a secret expedition, and not that it was an expedition destined against the insurgents of Biscay. Mr. Frere stated at Madrid his apprehensions respecting that armament, to which M. Cevallos makes no other answer, than that they were not intended to hurt us; not that they were collected in order to quell the revolt of the subjects of Spain. With respect to the real views of the court of Madrid, in the first agitation of the plan of her armament in the harbour of Ferrol, it must strike every body, therefore, that the persons the most likely to know, either gave them quite a different destination from that insisted on by M, &#x101F;Anduaga, or refused to give any satisfactory account whatever of their destination. It was not until after the receipt of those dispatches of M. &#x101F; Anduaga, in which the report occurs of the justification set up by him of the conduct of his court, that either M. Cevallos, or the governor of Gallicia say, that their object was to quell an insurrection in Biscay; and it
<image src="S1V0003P0I0205"/>
<col>381</col>
will doubtless strike the house, that the justification by M. &#x101F; Anduaga was gratuitous^ in other words, was a justification, the production of his own mind, and not in any sense founded on the instructions from his court: and indeed, there are but too many reasons to think that the armament was in the utmost degree hostile in its principle. It was scarcely possible that it could be at first intended to act against the revolted province. What appears to me, sir, unavoidable to our viewing it in any other light is, that the preparations for it should have been throughout of a pacific complexion, of a spirit and tendency in the highest degree neutral. If the force had been wanted to quell an insurrection in Biscay, and that it had been proper to have sent such force by sea, Spain had abundance of small craft in which to transport her troops; and such she would have been bound to have chosen, if her purpose was what she had finally stated it to be; thereby avoiding all appearance of hostility. In the second place, if she must employ her ships of war, what was more obviously likely to have been her course, than to have taken out their guns, and armed her vessels <i>en flute;</i> and not have ranged them alongside the French and Dutch ships in her hostile harbour of Ferrol? Add to this, that Spain has no ports, or none at which she could, with any hope of safety, land troops, in Biscay. But where and when was Spain to laud her troops, if we grant for the sake of the argument, that such was her intention? Why, sir, in the Bay of Biscay; that bay, incomparably the most tempestuous in Europe; and in this bay, the dread of the hardiest mariners, she was to land her troops, in the midst of the equinoxial gales! As to the other documents which have been laid before the house, which may be supposed to affect the information received from admiral Cochrane, undoubtedly, sir, in a statement from our consul at Cadiz, it is reported that there were, at the period he wrote, no armaments going on there. But two naval officers, one of them capt. Gore, writing on the 5th of Oct. reports very differently. Still the information from our consul might very well have been such as to give an idea that there were no armaments, or none that were considerable, going forward, at the time when he was drawing up that information. For myself, sir, I have no doubt in my mind of
<col>382</col>
the existence of the armaments in question. In order to demonstrate to us the hostile dispositions of the court of Madrid, one circumstance, which though minute1, was important. I allude, sir, to the arming of the packets. To dispose of all this, I contend, sir, that the evidence, so distinct, clear, and positive of admiral Cochrane, is supported by the very excuses and arguments of the Spanish govt. besides, had we not the evidence of their being armed, in the information of the governor of Gallicia, of a subsequent disarmament? This gent.'s information was material in another view; he told us, that they were not any longer armed ships of war, yet that the packets would remain armed. Thus, however <i>real</i> her armament, her disarmament was <i>nominal.</i> Now it cannot be said, that the condition of our neutrality or forbearance was, that she should not arm, nor make any armaments in her ports. How is the fact? Why, sir, an armament took place in a quarter most material for us to insist on her being disarmed, and that was in the port of Ferrol, where the gallantry of our seamen detained in a state of blockade, a squadron of France. The acquisition to this squadron, of a considerable Spanish force, might have occasioned not a little inconvenience. Certainly it would have obliged us to reinforce our blockading 'squadron; and possibly it would have been, in some respect, the means of causing a disadvantageous change of the positions of our general naval forces. All this, surely, was evidence of a hostile mind. That armament took place after a positive engagement with us, not to make any armaments whatever. In these circumstances, what was the conduct of the court of Spain? Days and weeks elapse without one order, account, or explanation, from that court to its minister M. &#x101F;Anduaga, to remove, at the court of England, those just apprehensions, jealousies, and unavoidable inquietudes which the known proceedings at Ferrol were, of necessity, to create. The same with respect to Mr. Frere, at Madrid. Not one word of explanation was given to bur charg&#x00E9; &#x101F;affaires, of the nature or object of these armaments; but he was told, generally, but most evasively that they were not intended to hurt G> Britain. This idle jargon continued to be the language of the Spanish minister, until they received the intelligence from the Governor if Gallicia of the dextrous attempt of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0206"/>
<col>383</col>
M. &#x101F;Anduaga to persuade, our court that the armaments were for quelling the rebellion of Biscay. M; &#x101F;Anduaga's own dispatches arriving, informed the ministers of Spain more particularly of the colour their ambassador had given to the transaction. Yet, when we know, sir, that the same governor of Biscay did at the outset, when not furnished with the ingenious but unavailing excuses of M. &#x101F;Anduaga, inform us, that the expedition was a secret one, shall we be amused out of the conviction of our understanding? If any man should believe M. &#x101F;Anduaga, with the evidence now before us, it will exceed my imagination of puerile credulity. But, sir, I do not believe that it will be advanced by any man in this house, that there were not armaments in the ports of Spain; nor can I see how those armaments can be accounted for, but on the principle of a hostile disposition. As to the armaments in other respects, I have only stated what was done. The simple question in reference to our moderation towards Spain, is not whether we did not do enough, but whether we did not do too much? whether we did not remit our due vigour and decision in not declaring war on the instant? If we had at once declared war, it would have been consistent with substantial justice. As it was, our reservation amounted to a pointed end conditional declaration of war. A breach of neutrality was declared actual hostility. By this conditional declaration of war, if circumstances should arise, we were entitled to act at once; so that when we knew of the hostile preparations and armaments in the ports of Spain, we were justified instantly to declare war; because, if we could prevent the treasures of that power from reaching in safety her ports, we should be preventing a junction of the forces of the three powers of Spain, France, and Holland; the succouring of an inveterate enemy, the replenishing of his coffers, or the recruiting of his armies: for assuredly these treasures were not destined for the coffers of Spain, but for those of France. Even in this proceeding, the moderation and friendly dispositions of his maj.'s govt. were as obvious as unequivocal. We detained the frigates of Spain, indeed, but, by the mode of that detention, we left a door open to Spain, to return to her ancient friendships, to the line of her generous and magnanimous policy in better pays, to the course of her high-minded, honourable propensities and feelings, to
<col>384</col>
her true interests, to the paths of her renown and her glory. Now, if we did not at once declare war against Spain, knowing the motives of our unparralleled forbearance, I think it too hard, sir, for gentlemen to charge us with the contravention* of the law of nations, with want of good, faith, or the violation of the most liberal, enlightened principles of a just and prudent policy. It will be found, sir, that we have treated Spain with a kindness, of which, perhaps, no epoch of history can furnish an instance. We carried our indulgence to the utmost extent. We were not, to the last moment, hostile, but to an extent singularly limited: and although Spain was giving every kind of assistance to her ally, although joined with naval force, she was pouring her treasures into her coffers; still we were willing to listen to her ministry, and, if possible, to avert from her the evils of war. Has Spain requited our friendship? With the two conditions on which our forbearance could be continued, on which she could be permitted to maintain her neutrality, she refused to comply. These were, first, the cessations of all armaments; and secondly, the communications of the terms of the treaty of St. Hdefonse. We did not demand more than was necessary to our safety. We demanded nothing but our confirmed right. If we had not insisted on this promptly, and made it a <i>sine qua non,</i> we might, indeed, have been accused of weakness, of pusillanimity, and imbecility. After long concealing her armaments in other ports, Spain evinced, besides, a determination to refuse explanation of those, and of what we alike required, the treaty of 1795. From these circumstances, war had become inevitable. This was the case long before the affair of the frigates. In fact, their seizure was not known at the time of the discussion at Madrid, or of the notification of the 7th Nov. As to the detention of the frigates, the irrefragable justice of that measure must he obvious to the world. That circumstance, however, makes no part of the case, and we should equally have been at war had it never taken place. I do not say this to extenuate that proceeding, of which I trust I have already said enough completely to justify, deplorable as some of the circumstances were with which it was attended, as indeed bloodshed, though shed even in lawful war, must always be regretted, yet that occurrence certainly had no influence on the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0207"/>
<col>385</col>
final decision of the question of peace or war.&#x2014; I trust, sir, that I have sufficiently proved that, even in the commencement of the negotiations we had a just cause of war, which never was abandoned; that during the second period our forbearance, while Spain became bound, and actually paid a war subsidy of 3 millions sterling to France, was conditional; and that the condition being violated, we again were possessed of the right of war provisionally declared; and all our demands of satisfaction and security being rejected, we are in consequence at open war. Under these circumstances, I entertain a full confidence that the vote of this house will recognize the justice of our cause and sanction the conduct of the govt. and that we shall lay at the foot of the throne the professions of a dutiful and loyal people, determined to make every sacrifice in the vindication of their rights, and in the defence, of their country.&#x2014;I shall conclude, sir, with moving, "That an humble address be presented to his majesty, to acquaint his majesty, that we have taken into our most serious consideration, the papers which have been laid before us by his majesty's command, relative to the discussions which have taken place with the court of Spain: That we observe with the greatest satisfaction, that, through the whole of the transaction, his majesty has! carried his moderation and forbearance to the utmost extent which was consistent with a due regard to the honour of his crown and the interests of his dominions: That, while we fully concur in the propriety and necessity of those prompt and vigorous measures of precaution which his majesty found himself compelled to adopt in consequence of the naval armaments fitted out by Spain, we see at the same time a fresh proof of his majesty's earnest desire. to avoid, if possible, the extremity of war, in the first opportunity which he even then offered to the court of Spain, to enter on pacific negotiation: And that, impressed with these sentiments, and fully convinced of the justice of the war, which the conduct of the court of Spain (evidently under the influence and controul of France) has rendered unavoidable, we shall not fail to afford his majesty our most zealous and cordial, support in every measure which may be necessary for prosecuting the war with vigour, and bringing it to a safe and honourable termination."</membercontribution></p>

<col>386</col>
tails into which it would be necessary for him to enter, in order to confute the various fallacies of the right hon. gent. who had just sat down: details as extraordinary for the magnitude of their extent as for the importance of the objects which they embraced. To lessen, the arduousness of the task, and to trespass as little as possible upon the patience of the house, he should touch but very slightly on those parts of the subject in which no material difference of opinion existed between him and the right hon. gent, and confine himself principally to the points in which they were completely at variance. Of the former description was the character of the treaty of St. Ildefonso. The right hon. gent, had taken a great deal of pains and displayed a great deal of talent in proving what he was willing enough to admit&#x2014;that this treaty was clearly an offensive as well as a defensive one, and that if not renounced by Spain, or the conditions of it explained in an unambiguous manner, and one that should be completely satisfactory to this country, it indisputably became a just cause for declaring war against her. At the same time that. he made this ad* mission, he by no means agreed with the right hon. gent*in opinion, that the arguments urged by M. &#x101F;Anduaga in his explanation of the tendency of this treaty were so void of weight as he seemed to imagine. These arguments strongly evinced the desire of Spain to limit that which had originally an offensive meaning to one purely defensive, and could this construction of the treaty have been maintained, it might certainly have proved equally advantageous to both countries. In his own mind, he was most decidedly of opinion, that it was the true policy of this country to have remained on good terms with Spain. As far as he could collect it from the strange, uncertain, indistinct mass of documents, which had been laid before the house on this subject, it seemed at one period to have been the original opinion of govt. He thought it would have been the policy of this country to maintain a good understanding with Spain, although that country were to have allowed to France the contingent or the substituted pecuniary succours. In his opinion, the subsidy which the right hon. gent. in alluding to it, had considered as totally, out of the question, might have been acquiesced in with perfect safety and propriety, provided the other points on which he had
<image src="S1V0003P0I0208"/>
<col>387</col>
allowed we were entitled to expect satisfaction, had been explained in a manner calculated to remove all uneasiness on our part. Persons in the situation in which he was, were not able to procure all the necessary information; but he would contend, and he was convinced it would be allowed by every impartial man, that his maj.'s ministers possessing, as they must, the most extensive and multifarious information, flowing in upon them from a variety of sources, ought to have decided among themselves the question of the policy of preserving peace with Spain, and then have declared to that country, the exact boundaries of the neutrality beyond which it could not be allowed to pass.&#x2014;He would follow, or endeavour to follow the right hon. gent, through the intricate labyrinth of his arguments, as well as his recollection and his ability would permit. But he would take the liberty to remark previously on the strange fact, that, antecedent to the 2d of June not a single dispatch; appears from lord Hawkesbury to Mr. Frere, communicating to him instructions, by which his conduct to the court of Spain was to be regulated. It was strange too, and it seemed to him most highly culpable, at the time when hostilities commenced between this country and France, and when our govt. must have been fully acquainted with the connection that subsisted between France and Spain, that no attempts were made at that critical period to ascertain the real disposition of Spain, and to endeavour to fix her in a determination of neutrality. The first document to which the right hon. gent. had alluded in his speech was that memorable dispatch of lord. Hawkesbury to Mr. Frere, dated the 2d of June, 1803. He had been curious to hear how the right hon. gent, would defend that paper. We had been told by him, that it proved the vigilant attention of ministers by the precision with which it marked out to Mr. Frere, the line of conduct he should adopt. When he first read the title of this paper it was with great expectation, an expectation which was increased by the perusal of the two or three earlier paragraphs; but on looking still farther, some positive points having been staled with regard to the assistance demanded by France from Spain&#x2014;but he would read lord Hawkesbury's words, "If the Spanish govt. should state to you that they Conceive themselves to be under the obligation to furnish to France the number of troops, and
<col>388</col>
ships which are stipulated in the treaty of St. Hdefonso, but that their co-operation will extend no farther"&#x2014;What then? Here is a foreseen case&#x2014;had any thing arisen not foreseen, an opinion might have been directed to be withheld&#x2014;but here, upon this case, in which the circumstances that must influence a judgment are distinctly pointed out, lord Hawkesbury goes on to say, "You will refrain from giving any Opinion upon this measure, but will content yourself with signifying, that you will transmit the information of it to your court." (See p. 62.) Mere is a satisfactory dispatch! It commences with professing to inform our minister how be is to act, and in continuation directs him to refer again to his own court. This truly was but a very inauspicious opening to this negotiation. So early ns the 3d of June, 1803, we find Mr. Frere beginning to detumid explanations in a note to M. Cevallos, and in a dispatch soon after to lord Hawkesbury, he mention's his answer. This, by the way, tie would observe, was one of the many communications, which but for the motion he had submitted to the house would never have been prod-aced on their table. Notwithstanding that motion, however, no dispatches had appeared from our govt. to Mr. Frere, between the 2d of June and the 24th of Nov. The right hon. gent. had endeavoured to shew that there were no circumstances during that period which required that fresh instructions should be sent to Mr. Frere; but this appeared to him to be by no means clearly established. it was surely very material, at a time when Spain was engaged in a negotiation with France, the avowed object of which was to settle the amount of the pecuniary succours which she was to contribute in lieu of the contingent of troops and vessels, that our minister at the court of Madrid should have been putts possession of the most ample and minute information of the way in which he should conduct himself to that court. Mr. Frere'S dispatches of the 5th and 15th of Aug. which were received on the V2th and 50th Sept. must have sufficiently apprised ministers of the urgent demands made by France on Spain, to furnish either the contingent or the pecuniary succours in lieu of ft. Was it not incumbent on our govt. He enter seriously into the discussion of this most important question, and to have communicated to Mr. Frere the result of their consultation, that fee might know de-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0209"/>
<col>389</col>
cidedly how to act? But instead of this, after hearing of the French negotiations at Madrid, the administration of this country sent not a single instruction to Mr. Frere, from the 2d to the 24th of Nov. but left him to conduct himself entirely at his own discretion. In that time he might have unadvisedly committed the country in the most serious and irrevocable manner. To him there appeared, in this interval, the most unpardonable remissness in the minister for the foreign department, a remissness which, in his mind, no explanation could extenuate.&#x2014;As the right hon. gent. had passed lightly over the circumstance of the conveyance of French troops through Spain to Ferrol, he would follow his example, although he had considerable doubts in his mind whether there existed any thing in that transaction which could be construed into a breach of neutrality.&#x2014;We now come to lord Hawkesbury's dispatch to Mr. Frere, dated 24th Nov. 1803, on the great importance of which the right on. Gent. dwelt with peculiar emphasis. This dispatch was occasioned by letters received from Mr. Frere, dated 9th and 11th Oct. in which the treaty between France and Spain is stated to be in the act of negotiating. The right hon. gent. had laid Considerable stress upon what he calls the precise instructions contained in this dispatch to Mr. Frere. To him the principles it contained appeared so intolerable, that the most violent infractions of the law of nations by that power, against whom the right hon. gent, had so frequently thundered his anathemas, were moderate in the comparison. He must in the first place, observe, that though lord Hawkesbury had been perfectly aware of the treaty carrying on between France and Spain, he had not previously insisted on any explanation of that treaty, or of the circumstance of the passage of French troops through Spain to Ferrol. In this dispatch of the 24th Nov. lard Hawkesbury thus expresses himself: "The preservation of peace with Spain has, from the period of the commencement of the present war, been the constant object of his maj.'s policy, but the Spanish govt. must themselves feel that this object can only be attained by their earnest endeavours to do every thing which depends upon them for the maintenance for a fair system of neutrality, and by their causing that neutrality to he respected by the other be digerent powers. When the question
<col>390</col>
therefore occurs."&#x2014;The question had occurred, and lord Hawkesbury knew it had occurred&#x2014;"When the question therefore occurs, how far his maj. would consent that the Spanish govt. should purchase their neutrality by an advance of pecuniary succours to the French govt. and would still regard them as neutrals, this must be considered as in some degree depending on the amount of the succours so to be advanced, and likewise on the determination of the Spanish govt. to insure their neutrality in all other respects; for, at the time, when his maj. might be disposed to disregard any small or temporary advance of money, if essential for the attainment of such an object, it would be impossible for him to consider a permanent advance to the extent of that stated by you, in any other light than as a subsidy to the French govt. and as possibly the most effectual assistance which the Spanish govt. could afford them for the prosecution of the war." &#x2014;What should naturally follow all this? Why, that if the terms were not agreed to, a declaration of war must ensue. Our govt. should have described with accuracy, the limits beyond winch they would not allow the conduct of Spain to pass, under the name of neutrality, and should have fully authorised their agent at the court of Madrid to declare war, should the conditions not be complied with. Lord Hawkesbury goes on: "His maj. can only be induced to abstain from immediate hostilities in consequence of such a measure, upon the consideration that it is a temporary expedient from which the Spanish govt. are determined to extricate themselves as soon as possible, and that his maj. must be at liberty to consider a perseverance, in the system of furnishing pecuniary succours to France as, at any period, when circumstances may render it necessary, a just cause of war." &#x2014;The hon. gent. requested that gent, would attend particularly to this part of the question, as it was one of the most important in the whole discussion. If the principle contained in this dispatch was admitted, there would be an end at once of all public faith and national security. What is this principle? That having once a justifiable cause of war, explanations may be suspended, and a right reserved to go to war whenever convenience may require! Is this compatible with the good faith and national honour that the right hon. gent. so frequently talks of? If you once suspend, a cause of complaint, and do not at the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0210"/>
<col>391</col>
time make it a ground of immediate war, common justice and the law and practice of nations require that you must again bring that complaint under discussion be-.fore you declare war. Our ministers had assumed a great deal of generosity in their treatment of Spain, when, in fact, they had placed her in a situation worse than that of a hostile army in a truce. He called on gent, to say, whether this could be maintained? If the right hon. gent.'s arguments did not go to establish the principle he had repeated, he did not know to what they aimed. These instructions produced a new negotiation at Madrid between Mr. Frere and M. Cevallos. In one of Mr. Frere's dispatches, he laments the ignorance in which he is left by his court, and talks of the "air of a superior information" with which M. Cevallos addressed" him, He sincerely sympathized in Mr. Frere's feelings on this occasion, and most decidedly condemned the conduct of the administration that had placed him in so auk-ward a predicament by their culpable neglect. In an account of a conference that Mr. Frere had with M. Cevallos, as related in the dispatch of the 27th Dec. in answer to the demand of the Spanish minister, "whether the affording the pecuniary succours to France would be considered as a ground of war, and whether he was authorised to declare it," he says, "that he was so authorised, and that war would be the infallible consequence." Where did Mr, Frere get this determined tone? Not in his instructions from lord Hawkesbury, for in them he is confined to "protesting." It was very strange if he took it on himself to speak so decidedly without authority. Mr. Frere's note of the 13th Dec. contained demands for explanation on two points, the subsidy to Spain, and the admission of French troops into Spain, with a view to the danger of Portugal. M. Cevallos's answer states, that the pecuniary succours had been afforded to France, expressly to avoid hostilities with G. Britain; and he, cites a conference M. &#x101F;Anduaga had held with lord Hawkesbury, in which the English minister had not declared any objection to the furnishing of this equivalent. With regard to Portugal, he observes, that Spain had concerted measures for her security. Not satisfied with these explanations, Mr. Frere, on the 26th Dec. addressed a note to M. Cevallos, couched in terms of unaccountable boldness, in which he repeats his demands. In Mr. Frere's
<col>392</col>
note of the 18th Feb. though he knew the subsidiary treaty of Spain with France was concluded in Sept. he couples it with the armaments, and demands an ultimatum on these subjects in the most decided language. In spite of the sophistry of the rt. hon. gent, who had endeavoured to shew that there was no agreement between G. Britain and Spain, recognizing the neutrality of the latter power, yet what is there that can constitute an agreement if this does not? If in discussion you state certain conditions without which you will not agree, it is surely implied that if those conditions are not violated, the compact is formed. Now, in the conference that lord Hawkesbury had with M. &#x101F;Anduaga, this was precisely the case.&#x2014;In a subsequent dispatch Mr. Frere gives an account of two conversations with the prince of peace. He pressed several points which he afterwards made the subject of a formal note to the Spanish court, to which he received no answer, on which the right hon. gent, had commented most severely. If this answer was so dissatisfactory, why did not lord Hawkesbury see M. &#x101F;Anduaga and tell him so, and repeat to Mr. Frere his positive instructions? In a note to Mr. Frere from M. Cevallos, dated the 2Sd March, 1804, he adopts the language of Mr. Frere's note of the 18th Feb. and intimates that the British govt. had recognized the neutrality of Spain on certain terms. In the dispatch from Mr. Frere to lord Hawkesbury of the 18th April, in which this note is inclosed, he says, "as there is nothing "in any note of mine which could be "brought forward as a foundation for "such a conclusion, I have not thought "it worth while to enter any protest in "answer to M. Cevallos's insinuation," (see page 91.) It certainly was Mr. Frere's duty to protest against this assertion; it was his duty, for the sake of his own credit, for the honour of his country, and for the security of Spain. The hon. gent. said, he could not express his indignation at his conduct, in not doing so in language sufficiently strong, to do justice to his feelings. If we recur, said he, to the course of proceedings between man and man, this doctrine will forcibly apply. I am at law with a man who does not, however, wish any longer to remain so, provided I grant him certain terms. I acquiesce. I am not to, molest him unless he violates those terms. Our disputes are to be adjusted amicably. But when I find him off his guard, his pre-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0211"/>
<col>393</col>
parations discontinued, council dispersed, witnesses, gone each his way, himself reposing in unsuspecting security, up I lift my arm, or violently wield the arm of the law, and crush the poor man to death. Is this honour? Is this justice? And yet much of such a complexion is the transaction with Spain. Mr. Frere had by his plighted pledge got Spain to disarm, but a principle is reserved, and now is acted upon, of going to war with Spain the moment it suited our convenience so to do. But to this remissness, which in this case attached to Mr. Frere, and during the whole of the negotiation to lord Hawkesbury, was to be attributed the war in which we were plunged, and the dishonour with which our national character was stained. In M. &#x101F;Anduaga's note, the terms on which it was imagined the British govt. would consent to the observance of neutrality were distinctly stated; if to these terms lord Hawkesbury made no objection, the inference was clear that they were consented to. From Jan. 21 to the time lord Hawkesbury went out of office, no dispatches appeared. At that period a "faction," as the noble lord called it, (see vol. 2. p. 342), combined; the administration was amended much in the same way as bills were sometimes amended in that house, and to carry on the simile, he hoped that house would soon exercise the power of repealing it. Thus did Lord Hawkesbury remove without another word, retaining no doubt, in his dying moments the most pacific dispositions; at least there did not exist a single line farther to disapprove of such a disposition, and it was probable that the old proverb," silence gives consent," was verified in this case. Then began lord Harrowby's administration; in the first part of which a similar remissness prevailed, which was afterwards aggravated by steps of the most unjustifiable haste and violence.&#x2014;With regard to the order given by lord Harrowby to admiral Cochrane, on his receiving intelligence that the Spanish fleet was arming in Ferrol, to blockade that port, it was perfectly justifiable. Two dispatches existed of the date of the 29th Sept. from lord Harrowby to Mr. Frere; one containing ostensible, the other private instructions, both warranting him to break off negotiation, and quit' Madrid, if his demands for the disarming the Spanish ships were not complied with. To the note which Mr. B. Frere addressed on this sub-
<col>394</col>
ject, to the Spanish govt. he received what he chooses to term an unsatisfactory answer, but which certainly contains as complete a satisfaction as language can convey. It stated that whatever information the British govt. might have received, yet-that the armament had been but trifling, and that it should cease. In fact it had ceased at that time. That Mr. B. Frere thought this reply satisfactory, appears clearly from his remaining at Madrid which otherwise he could not have done without disobeying his instructions. On the 2Sth Sept. Mr. Frere received instructions to make further representations on the subject of armaments; that is on what no longer existed. He did so, and the reply was an utter disclaiming of all armaments injurious to G. Britain, stating the improbability of such a thing after the agreement by which the neutrality of Spain had been acknowledged by G. Britain. Mr. Frere then, for the first time, denies the existence of any such agreement, or recognizance, though in a letter to lord Harrowby he had spoken of it, and he asserts the monstrous proposition that G. Britain has a right to declare war on any armament that Spain may make, for whatever purpose. He then required that the Spanish ships should be placed on the same footing on which they were before the convention, and on no account that any addition should be afterwards made to them. In the refusal of Spain to comply he demanded his passports. Surely Mr. Frere must have exceeded the bounds to which his instructions authorized him to proceed; there was no cause for his abrupt proceeding, unless in the interim he received advice of the unfortunate event of the seizure of the Spanish frigates: an event indeed doubly unfortunate, first in the loss of so many innocent human beings; and secondly, in the idelible stain on British good faith and honour. At length passports were granted to Mr. Frere's urgent and repeated requests, and so the negotiation ended. The hurry with which Mr. Frere quitted Madrid, and the unwillingness he evinced to receive any further explanation, reminded him of a scene in the Rivals, where Sir Lucius O'Trigger, in a dispute in which his friend Acres is engaged, shuts his ears to all accommodation, exclaiming, "It is a very pretty quarrel as it stands, and if you say any more you will only spoil it."&#x2014;He had shewn how much blame attached to ministers for their
<image src="S1V0003P0I0212"/>
<col>395</col>
indecision in an early part of the negotiation, as to their true policy with regard to Spain, and for their shameful reserve to that country with respect to their intentions; but the last violent outrage committed in the seizure of the frigates, filled up the measure of their iniquity. On the very day that the govt. had received advices from admiral Cochrane, stating the armaments at Ferrol, did they give these unjust and infamous orders. He should feel himself gratified by learning whether the Spaniards did not give the most satisfactory references as to the armaments in their ports. They affirmed, in the first place, that the armaments were not intended to be employed against this country, and to other remonstrances that they had no longer any existence. As this explanation was given, why was the discussion on the other point be abruptly terminated? If an accredited minister was to be sent to Madrid, why could not ministers have waited till his arrival at Madrid," instead of giving those precipitate orders which had produced such lamentable effects? It could not be seriously urged that Spain meant any thing hostile to this country. Her internal and political situation refuted the idea. Spain, almost verging to political dissolution, wasted by pestilence, and scourged by a devouring famine, could entertain no idea of hostility against a country with which it has so many powerful ties of interest. The very ports where the preparations were stated to be, tended to shew that no hostilities on a great scale were intended. Was it credible that at Carthagena, where thousands were expiring of a pestilential and loathsome disease, there were any views of a hostile nature entertained? Mr. Duff's reports in July and Aug. likewise shewed that there were at Cadiz no preparations of a formidable description. The ships were in general old and crazy, and the arsenals were destitute of stores of all sorts. There was no wood but the country pine, and no contract had been formed for procuring supplies from the Baltic. Without attaching any blame to admiral Cochrane, for whom he thought the highest respect ought to be entertained, he could not help saying, that top much stress had been, without inquiry, laid on his statements. The feelings of nature, as veil as the habits of his profession, might have led him to give too highly coloured a picture of the state of the naval preparations in Spain. There was an officer in
<col>396</col>
the house, the captain of the Malta, whose opinion he should have wished produced on the present occasion. That officer had been on the Ferrol station, and could give very important information to the house. At all events the matter was one very fit to be inquired into. But had ministers made such an inquiry previous to the issuing of orders for seizing the Spanish frigates? They certainly had not; nay, he was not quite sure that even a cabinet council was convened on the business. He was almost inclined to think that lord Melville had taken on himself the responsibility of issuing the orders in question. Was this, he asked, a decent, honourable mode of proceeding? Was it fair treatment to a nation, anxious for our friendship, and compelled to stoop under the rod of an unfeeling despot? It was in vain that explanations were offered, and that assurances of neutrality were given by the Spanish govt. Indeed there was much of the appearance of a wish to come to a rupture. The abrupt and precipitate departure of Mr. Frere had very much of that appearance. In defence of the seizure of the Spanish frigates, it was described as a measure of precaution. This he denied, for it was a direct measure of war. While a dispute was pending betwixt two countries, they had both a right to take measures of precaution. If one nation ordered their army to be augmented, the other had a right to order a similar increase in its military establishment. If the one increased its navy, the other might be bound in prudence and policy to place its naval force on a more enlarged footing. If the Spaniards had preparations in their ports, we had a fair right to watch the motions of their ships, but we had no right to seize their ships, their persons, and their goods, without even an appearance of a declaration of war. It was an act uprincipled and atrocious in the highest degree, and calculated to degrade the character of the country at a time when it was so important to stand high in the opinion of Europe as the defender of its liberties against lawless dominion. And now, said the hon. gent, having gone over most of the ground of the right hon. gent, having admitted the hostile character of the treaty of St. Hdefonso, but deprecated the abuse of the principle of war which that treaty yielded; having shewn that we abandoned our claim to the right, substituting the recognition of a neutrality; having demonstrated, at least to my own conviction
<image src="S1V0003P0I0213"/>
<col>397</col>
that Spain has not violated her neutrality; having proved the pacific dispositions of Spain, and that there were no armaments carrying on against G. Brit, in the ports of that power; having clearly established that the order of 18th of Sept. and the consequent seizure of the Spanish frigates, were not measures of precaution, but of violence, injustice, and bad faith, I shall now conclude by moving the following amendment to the address moved by the right hon. gent.&#x2014;"To return his maj. the thanks of this house for the communications made to us relative to the rupture with Spain. To express our entire conviction that the existence of a defensive treaty between France and Spain would have entitled his maj. to consider Spain as a principal in the present war unless the obligations of that treaty were renounced, or their execution disclaimed; and to assure his maj. that we shall at all times be ready to support him in giving effect, so far as the interests of his dominions may require, to this just and undisputed principle.&#x2014;That we observe, however, that his maj. was-advised to wave the exercise of this right, in order-to negotiate with Spain, for the maintenance of her neutrality. And that, without taking upon ourselves -in the present moment to decide a question of policy depending so much on circumstances of which we are still uninformed, we acknowledge with gratitude this proof of his maj.'s paternal desire to have prevented the further extension of the calamities of war.&#x2014; But that we beg leave humbly to represent to his maj. that the execution of these his benevolent wishes indispensably required from his ministers the adoption of some just, intelligible, and uniform principles of negotiation, declared in the outset with frankness, and steadily pursued to its conclusion; followed up by an unremitting attention to every new circumstance-arising in tie progress of so important a discussion; and, accompanied by the most scrupulous care that all engagements resulting from it should, on the part of G. Brit, be defined with precision, and-performed with unquestionable good faith, moderation, and integrity.&#x2014;Tha!t we have on the contrary, seen with regret in the whole conduct of this transaction, the clashing effects of undecided, equivocal, and contradictory policy. That the wishes for peace professed in the outset by his maj.'S ministers, have uniformly been conteracted by their studious
<col>398</col>
endeavours to keep alive both the cause and the menace of war; a purpose equally inconsistent with justice and with wisdom, destructive of all confidence on the part of the power with whom they treated, and incompatible with the object for which they were negotiating. That during the whole course of those discussions, while they were continually soliciting from Spain unreserved communications on points of mutual interest, their own indecision prevented them in return from returning a distinct statement of the terms on which G Brit, would consent to recognize the neutrality of that power. That their ground of negotiation was repeatedly shifted, their demands varied, and their concessions undefined; and that although some agreement appears-at last to have been concluded, neither its date, nor its conditions were ascertained with precision; yet, both are repeatedly referred to, by the British, as well as the Spanish ministers, and the breach of those very conditions is all edged as the motive on the part of G. Brit, for her actual commencement of hostilities.&#x2014;That the omissions and defects which distinguish those transactions, as well as the fatal consequences to which it has led, can only be ascribed to the erroneous principle on which it was grounded, and to the criminal and almost incredible negligence with which it has been conducted. That it is particularly our duty to represent to his maj. that in a negotiation for peace or war between G. Brit. and Spain, carried on principally at Madrid, no instructions were sent to his maj.'s minister at that court, from the 2d of June to the 24th of Nov. in the year 1803; from thence to the 21st of Jan. in. the year following; not again from that date to the 29th of Sept. That in the first of these intervals, being little less than 6 months, the negotiation for a treaty of neutrality between France and Spain was begun, continued, and concluded; yet not the smallest intimation was, in that long time, given to Mr. Frere, of the light in which that negotiation was considered here; of the language it was proper for him to hold; or of the measures it might be necessary for him to take; although frequent communications were made to him on the subject, by the Spanish govt. who appear to have been disposed to pay great attention in this instance to any representation from G. Brit.&#x2014;That during the last of the above mentioned periods, the same minister though left again for many months without any instructions
<image src="S1V0003P0I0214"/>
<col>399</col>
whatever, negotiated and concluded some agreement with Spain on this most important subject, of which agreement no opinion was ever expressed to him from hence, either before or after its conclusion; nor does it even now appear, from any official documents, whether the same was meant to be allowed or disallowed, ratified or rejected, by the Brit. govt.&#x2014;That we feel ourselves compelled to express to his maj. that in the farther progress of these transactions, the indecision and neglect of his govt. were succeeded by precipitate resolutions and acts of violence equally injurious to the honour and interest of his kingdom. &#x2014;That we should have applauded any endeavour by firm and temperate representation to extricate our relations with Spain from the confusion in which they had been involved, and to bring them to a distinct issue of acknowledged neutrality or decided war, but that we find no trace of any such attempt. And that in the middle of Sept. on the first intimation of supposed movements in the Spanish ports, acts of hostility were decided on by his maj.'s govt. previous to all complaint, and executed without notice during a period of amicable negotiation.&#x2014;That the dispositions of Spain appear, from the information of his maj.'s minister at Madrid, to have continued up to that moment friendly to G. Brit, and that the conduct of his maj.'s ministers, in having, under such circumstances, anticipated all explanation by concealed orders for an attack on Spanish ships, property, and subjects, cannot be justified on any ground of public law, much less reconciled to those principles of moderation and liberality which belong to the British character, and which in the present situation of Europe is peculiarly the duty of this country to maintain inviolate. &#x2014;That on reviewing the discussions which immediately preceded the present war, we cannot but represent to his maj. the essential difference between the conduct of the person left in charge of his maj.'s affairs at Madrid, and the tenor of the only instructions under which he appears to have acted. That the explanations given to that gent. by the Spanish govt. though not in all points adequate to the just expectations of this country, were yet such as ought manifestly (according to those instructions) to have determined him to wait at Madrid for the arrival of an accredited minister authorized by his maj. to arrange with that court all points of difference. And that
<col>400</col>
we have therefore seen with equal surprise and indignation the final decision of his maj.'s ministers, not only to adopt the inconsiderate resolution taken by the king's representative in withdrawing himself from Madrid, but also to treat with utter disregard the subsequent offer from the Spanish minister at this court to pursue the same discussions here; an offer which, if accepted, might probably have led to a satisfactory conclusion on matters upon which the two courts were so nearly agreed. That while we have thus thought it our duty to represent to his maj. the errors of his ministers in the conduct of this important transaction, and the fatal consequences which have resulted from them, we beg leave to repeat our humble assurance that we are ready to support his maj. to the utmost in every measure necessary to assert the rights and vindicate the honour of his crown, objects which can never be successfully pursued by negligent and undecided councils, nor attained by the violation of engagements on which those with whom we treat have rested their security."&#x2014;The amendment being read, and the question put,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01176"><member>Lord Castlereagh</member><membercontribution> rose. His ldp. said, he felt no necessity to follow the hon. gent. through all his details and arguments, when he recollected the able and animated speech made by his right hon. friend who opened the debate. Of whatever blame could be imputed to the govt. for their conduct towards Spain, he was very ready to take his full share. He was happy to rind the hon. gent. agreed with govt. on the construction to be put on the treaty of St. Hdefonso. Indeed, he went as tar on this subject as could be wished by any one; he allowed, that no treaty going to the length that this does could be called inoffensive. When the hon. gent, had made this allowance, he was surprised- to find him follow it up by observing, that he considered it would have been highly proper for this country to have obliged Spain to come to some distinct explanation. He was more surprised at this, because the hon. gent. agreed to the policy of keeping Spain neutral, so much so, that he conceived a subsidy of 3 millions annually not too great a price to pay for Spanish neutrality. But what encreased his surprise to its greatest height was, that the hon. gent. after commiserating the unfortunate and dependant situation of Spain, could think it expedient to press for an explana-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0215"/>
<col>401</col>
tion which must have driven her into a war with one power or another. The hon. gent. complains, that when lord Hawkesbury sent his first instructions to Mr. Frere, he should have been fully prepared to say, whether, if the pecuniary succours were afforded we should deem it a just cause for an immediate war; but this would depend on circumstances which could only be ascertained at Madrid, and could not be foreseen. Among other omissions with which government had been charged, was that of attention to the notes of M. &#x101F;Anduaga to the secretary of state; they were of little authority, being without date and signature. Nothing, too, was so fatal to the cause of peace, as a double negotiation. Mr. Frere having been instructed how to act, Madrid was the proper theatre for the discussion. The hon. gent, had intimated, that in the conferences which lord Hawkesbury had held with M. &#x101F;Anduaga, a kind of agreement was tacitly allowed with regard to the conditions of neutrality; but this idea originated in the misapprehension of the Spanish ambassador. With regard to the substitution of pecuniary succours, for a contingent of troops and vessels, be could by no means agree, that a nation which had covenanted with another to afford moderate succours, was at liberty to convert those succours into money without the consent of the power against whom the succours were to be employed. By converting the aid into money, those against whom it was to be turned were deprived of those means of attacking and seizing it which they would have if it were applied in the shape of ships and men. It was allowed by the hon. gent. that in the first instance there was sufficient ground for bringing matters directly to the point of peace or war. Consequently, if the govt. had done nothing to give up this right, it still remained. It was clear, that as far as related to the conduct of the govt. at home, nothing had been done that could be construed into a resignation of that right. In the whole of the transactions with Spain, the right had never been suffered to emerge; and lord Harrowby, in his instructions to. Mr. Frere to bring the question to the last trial, shewed clearly that he considered the right as never once lost sight of. If, therefore, Mr. Frere had done any thing at Madrid, any thing amounting to an agreement of this nature, he must have done so in direct violation of his instructions.&#x2014;His ldp. next proceeded to shew from Mr. Frere's
<col>402</col>
dispatches, that he had constantly kept in view this part of his instructions, and that he had always considered it as a most essential point to give no pledge or engagement which would bind his maj. to respect what he always considered as an uncertain and unsubstantial neutrality. He then proceeded to shew, that it was equally wrong to suppose that Mr. B. Frere acknowledged such an agreement or convention. In his note to M. Cevallos, in which he used the word convention, he expressly denied that the neutrality of Spain had ever been agreed upon, or even mentioned in any of the communications from his maj.'s minister, so as to give reason to expect it would be recognized. All that had been proposed on our part amounted to nothing more than the statement of the conditions on which we would consent to a forbearance from war for the present, and to enter into negotiations on other points. But never had any thing been said, that could give countenance to the hope of our respecting a neutrality so nearly connected with our mortal enemy. Mr. B. Frere considered the relation between us and Spain only a suspension of hostilities; and, therefore, when he used the word convention, it was in a very different sense from that which some gent, supposed. The mere assent of Spam to these primary conditions of forbearance was not sufficient to constitute an agreement of neutrality, nor could it be expected by Spain that we would give so great a boon for such inadequate concessions. If silence were to he construed into consent on our part, it might as well be argued that lord Hawkesbury's silence gave consent to M. &#x101F;Anduaga's construction of the treaty of St. Hdefonso. Surely it would not be said, that every thing that was not formally contradicted was therefore admitted and re-cognized. But even of a formal agreement had existed, it must necessarily follow that any deviation from the terms of that agreement would leave us at liberty to go to war. The conduct of Spain with respect to the armaments in Ferrol was a direct breach of the agreement, if such an agreement had existed, inasmuch as it was contrary to the first condition required, He agreed, that Spain was forced into the transactions we complained of by France. That consideration was the cause of all our forbearance: but when there was Reason to think that France was about to exert its tyrannical influence further, to drive Spain into a. general war against us, and that the arina
<image src="S1V0003P0I0216"/>
<col>403</col>
ment preparing by Spain was destined to carry reinforcements to her foreign possessions, to render them more secure from us in the event of a war, it became our duty to take care, that if we were to go to war with Spain, we should not have to commence hostilities under circumstances of such disadvantage. The arguments which the hon. gent, used on this subject went counter to the whole language of the Spanish govt. That govt. allowed the existence of the armament, and the disturbances in Biscay were assigned as the cause to which object the forces were applied, when from the conduct pursued by his maj.'s govt. it became necessary to abandon the expedition. Repeated notice had been given to Spain, and every care had been taken on our side to prevent the effusion of blood, and to avoid hostile collision; notice had been given of the removal of ships of war from one port to another; and if notice was not given of the intention to detain the treasure ships, it was, as lord harrowby very properly said, because the communication would be useless to Spain if it did not reach that country in time; and the design would be rendered abortive if it did. The whole essence of the instructions given to Mr. Frere was to obtain security from the conduct of Spain, and to endeavour, by all consistent means, to bring the negotiation to an amicable issue. But while M. &#x101F;Anduaga promised a strict and faithful neutrality here, British ships were seized in the ports of Spain, and a declaration of war published at Madrid. Indeed, through the whole negotiation, M. &#x101F;Anduaga did nothing more than go over what had already been discussed with Mr. Frere, at Madrid, with this difference, that M. &#x101F;Anduaga fell into some mistakes. Thus, whatever reasoning was contained in his note, war was declared by Spain on the ground of her alliance with France; and on that ground only. The substance of her convention with France was, that she should put the govt. of that country in possession of all her resources; and no greater proof need be required how much Spain is under the dominion of France, than the apprehension which she had of the danger of disclosing the terms of the convention. He therefore thought himself fully borne out, when he sat down in the full conviction, that the influence of France was the cause of the war which this country had most studiously and perseveringly endeavoured to avoid.
<col>404</col>
Earl Temple thought that his noble friend had misconceived the argument of the hon. gent. who preceded him. His right hon. relation (Mr. Pitt) had also brought forward his great abilities, not so much to shew what was the cause of the war, as to argue what might be the causes of war with Spain. For his part, he thought we had no right to keep our causes of war against Spain in our pockets, till we thought it convenient to produce them; he thought we should have dealt fairly and openly with that country, and have let them know on what terms we were content to maintain peace with them, and for what we should make war with them. Instead of that, our ministers told them, if you do so, we will make war with you; but they do not say, if you did not do so we will let you have, peace. He did not deny that there might have been good causes of war, but in the real cause for which we. were now at war, he conceived that government was much to blame. His lordship contended, that when ministers had once abandoned the treaty of St. Hdefonso, they could not commence hostilities by resuming its stipulations as their ground. They should have either adhered to it, and enforced its principles, or having departed from it, they could not stand justified in recurring to it for the purpose of answering the exigency of the moment. But the noble lord and his right hon. relation thought that a new cause of war had arisen from the circumstance of the substitution of money for ships and men. He differed from them, however, in supposing that they could, by any possible construction, recur at all to the treaty of St. Hdefonso as a justifiable ground for declaring war. He must again remind the house that the treaty had been previously abandoned altogether, on which account he was decidedly of opinion that it could not be afterwards taken up as a cause of war. From this view of the subject, it was impossible for him to allow his maj.'s ministers as much merit as they wished to claim, for their forbearance and humane feelings towards Spain.&#x2014;After a variety of observations upon the papers before the house, he remarked with considerable strength, on the first effort so lord Harrowby on his entrance into office, when he applied to Mr. Frere, not to learn the progress of the negotiation, or the state in which matters stood between Spain and England fairly considered, but to learn whether all the treasure ships were
<image src="S1V0003P0I0217"/>
<col>405</col>
come home. Ministers had taken great credit to themselves for their anxious desire to prevent hostilities, arid to avert the shedding of blood; but if any-one measure wals more calculated than another to promote what they professed to deprecate, it was the very, measure they had adopted by the order they sent. For if they had ordered a superior force to meet those frigates, then it would not have been incumbent on the Spanish admiral to fight for the sake of his honour: but what did they do? They dispatched only an equal force; the consequence of which was that blood was shed, without any advantage whatever having been produced to this country. He could not conceive how ministers could speak with such coolness of the blowing up of 300 men, women, and children. When he recollected this, he was surprised to hear them talk of preventing the effusion of blood. He should take the liberty also of calling the attention of the house to the instruction sent by lord Harrowby to Mr. Frere, which imported, that if he succeeded' in procuring the disarmaments in the ports of Spain, according to the stipulations of the original treaty, then he might notify to the Spanish court, that a minister should be sent to that country from G. Britain, in order to settle the other points at issue, but which should be reserved for consideration till the arrival of the new ambassador. It was extremely remarkable, however, that although Mr. Frere had been completely successful and had procured not only a discontinuance of all armaments in Ferrol and other ports, but an assurance of the most friendly disposition towards this Country; yet, notwithstanding, it was very strange he should have quitted Madrid. He felt it his duty, therefore, to state to the house, that he protested most solemnly against commencing and carrying on a war without any fixed principle; that he pro tested against the detention of the Spanish frigates, and abhorred the policy which had been the cause of the shedding so much blood: in fine, he protested against a system of aggression and unprovoked hostility, be cause he thought each of those considerations greatly injurious, not only to the interest but also to the character of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01177"><member>The Advocate General</member><membercontribution> (Sir John Nicholl) entered at considerable length into a discussion of the merits of the case on the part of our govt. as their conduct appeared to him to be countenanced and
<col>406</col>
authorised by the established usage or law of nations. This law was not to be found in any official document, which was universally agreed upon or enacted for that purpose. Our opinions on this subject were be guided by the following criteria: 1st, the sound deductions of natural reason; 2dly, the authority of the most eminent men; and 3dly, the most general practice observed by civilized nations when placed in circumstances similar to those, on the propriety or impropriety of which we have to bring our minds to a decision. In a plain, reasonable view of the subject, it if admitted that the treaty of St. Hdefonso was in itself a just and sufficient cause of war. The principle of self-defence which is so deeply implanted in the breast of man, was further roused by a consideration of the circumstances which followed. The force for which they had stipulated was to be commuted for a pecuniary aid to an immense extent. There were other terms extorted by the threats of general Bournonville, but which were never explained to us. We had another and a most important reason which prompted us to adopt precautionary measures, that was the mission of Mr. Le Brun, a naval officer. The object of that mission the prince of peace would not disclose to our Ambassador; but it was truly and obviously meant to procure the egress of the French and Spanish ships, and to render them more secure in their passage to some of the northern ports of France. From these observations there could be little doubt that they intended to act together. If so, this was an infraction of the supposed convention or agreement, which was understood to have existed between the two countries, and we had a reasonable ground for war. It then naturally followed, that we should feel ourselves particularly entitled to seize on that description of property which otherwise most probably would have been sent to replenish the coffers of our enemy. In this we did not out step the bounds prescribed by the most eminent writers on the law of nations, All writers from Vattel to Martens, who is one of the most modern on the subject, have agreed that if an injury be received, or an injustice done, and that explanation is demanded on the one side, and refused on the other if there is a notice given to the power so refusing, that, if such conduct is persisted in, it will be considered as a sufficient cause of war. If after this solemn, warning as
<image src="S1V0003P0I0218"/>
<col>407</col>
the writers on this subject observe, that power shall continue those acts which are deemed acts of aggression, and shall still withhold all explanation on the subject, hostilities against her will then be founded in the principles of justice. An hon. gent. had compared this conduct between two nations to similar conduct between man and man; this however was erroneous. An individual illegally threatened with a premeditated attack by another, would find protection and redress by appealing to the tribunals of the law. It was not so in national disputes: if one country perceived that another had assumed a fighting attitude, and that her own destruction, or any serious injury to her was threatened, she then had no recourse but that of putting herself into a similar posture, and endeavouring to give the first blow instead of receiving it, as most probably would otherwise have been the case. Every publicist of eminence has declared that we have a right to make use of the principle of fear to compel other nations to accede to our just demands. If this has not the weight which we calculated it would have with them, there was no alternative but that of having recourse to arms. That such a line of conduct should be adopted and acted upon pending a negociation, when all the other circumstances already mentioned were connected with it, was not without a precedent in the general conduct of civilized nations. On the contrary, it would be found that in almost every instance where it was thought necessary during the course of the last century, this was the general practice of this country, and of all other powers of Europe. In 1718, when Sir George Byng was sent to preserve the neutrality of Italy, a similar step was thought expedient, and was of course adopted. He did not want to conceal that an outcry was raised by Spain against the manner of proceeding, and that some persons in that House also protested against the measure. But the wisdom of the House over-ruled the objections, and the action was commended as a measure of necessary precaution. In 1726, admiral Hosier was sent to cruize off Porto Bello, and an attack was made on Gibraltar, though war was not declared for six weeks after. Even the attack on Gibraltar, was not considered as a total rupture. In 1739, the Spaniards seized all British vessels on their coast, even though contrary to an express article,
<col>408</col>
when they were apprehensive that we would otherwise inflict on them the first mark of the commencement of hostilities. In 1744, we sent a fleet to attack the French fleet off Dungeness, and yet there had been no previous declaration of war. In 1755, we seized all the French ships in our ports, and yet there were no reprisals for several months after. In 1761, the French in their, projet proposed, that all prizes before the declaration of war, should be restored as being taken contrary to the law of nations, but this was refused, upon the ground that they were not taken contrary to the law of nations. Inl762,the king of Spain ordered all English ships in his ports to be detained three weeks before a declaration of war. In the last war we seized Dutch property 9 months before a declaration, and the battle of Copenhagen also took place prior to a declaration of war. After producing several other instances, I do trust, said the hon. and learned gent. that from all these cases, it will be evident to the majority of this House and the bulk of the people of this country, that our honour is safe, and that we have not been guilty of a breach of the law of nations. I cannot but lament that any gentleman should think it his duty to put upon record a long argument which tends to make the nations of Europe believe that we are engaged in a war of injustice. I do trust that France and her proud ruler will find that the spirit of the people of England is as high as it was at any former period, and that we will consent to no peace, but such as provides for the permanent security of this country and of Europe.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[WAR WITH SPAIN.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01188">The order of the day being read for resuming the adjourned debate on this subject, several members rose. The Speaker explained the usual practice of the house with regard to the preference to be given to the member who rose the last to speak when the debate wag adjourned, which he said belonged to the right hon. gent. (Mr. Windham,) who was upon his legs when the adjournment took place; that gent. however, having waved his right,</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01189"><member>Mr. Raine</member><membercontribution> rose. He began by apologising for preventing any gent. from being heard, but upon so momentous a question he was anxious to deliver his sentiments at as early an hour as possible, being conscious that when the patience of the house was at all exhausted, he could not hope to engage that attention, which others of greater experience and known talents could command at any period of the-debate, however advanced. Although the right lion. gent. who opened the debate, and those who followed him in support of the address, had thought fit conveniently for the purpose of their argument, to consider this question as embracing only one topic of discussion, to those who attentively considered it, as it appeared to him, it must obviously present itself in two points of view; the one, whether supposing an apparent ground of complaint to have been laid, under all the circumstances of the case, it was consistent with sound policy to involve this country in a war with Spain; the other, whether the manner of commencing hostilities can be justified. The latter, with the leave of the house, he should take the liberty of examining first, as being by far the most important, in as much as it involved in its consideration up less a question than that of national honour. And he must confess, that so far from thinking the mode in which hostilities were commenced justifiable, he alluded of course to the attack upon the Spanish frigates, to him it appeared little better than an act of piracy. This was no doubt a grave charge, and ought not to be imputed on light grounds, but if he had the good fortune to convey intelligibly to the house that which had impressed complete conviction upon his own mind, viz. that it was not warranted by any sound precedent to be found in all political history, that it was a violation of the national faith implicitly pledged, and that it was contrary to, the express letter and spirit of the law of nations, he should go pretty far towards proving, if not the whole length of proving, that the act was little better than piratical. With regard to the precedents, he believed he might safely challenge those who supported the other side of the question to traverse the whole range of universal history so far as regards the practice of civilized nations; certain he was, he could boldly defy them to ransack our own history for a single instance of acknowledged authority upon which the act in
<col>412</col>
question, either in the comparison of circumstances, or upon the ground of analogy, could fairly be said to be justified. He was not unmindful of the several oases, cited by the hon. and learned gent. (the king's advocate) from the history of the last century. But, in the first place, not one of those cases which could be said in its circumstances to resemble this was considered as incorporated into the code of nations for acknowledged law, but was reprobated at the time as a flagrant breach. of that law; in the next place, they were all cited by the hon. and learned gent. himself, for the purpose of establishing, in point of fact, a principle which he (Mr. R.) was not at all interested or inclined to dispute; viz. that a formal declaration of war is not always necessary previous to the commencement of hostilities. This principle was extracted from Bynkershook, a writer upon the law of nations of undoubted authority, who, in the chapter upon this head, enumerates a variety of cases in which a formal declaration of war was not deemed necessary. But that writer does not lay it down as a principle, that in no case shall it be deemed necessary, On the contrary, Vattel, whose authority is relied upon by the hon. and learned gent. himself, does expressly state, that a declaration of war is necessary, and that, too, in a case which he should hereafter shew was analogous to the case now before the house. But, he was confident the hon. and learned gent. with all his research, could not produce, either from Bynkershook or any other writer upon whose authority he was prepared to pledge his own high character, a principle like this; viz. that during a negociation you may commence hostilities without a declaration of war; and yet that principle must be established, before you can be said satisfactorily to have justified the manner in which hostilities were in this instance commenced. There was an instance in our history which, in many respects, bore a striking resemblance to the case now under consideration; he meant the attack of the Dutch Smyrna fleet by Holmes, in the time of Charles II. But, as that was one and not the least of many measures of infamy, for which the cabal of that day deserved and obtained the execrations of posterity, he presumed no well-constituted govt. would justify itself upon such a precedent. There, too, after the hostile blow was struck, certain grievances were discovered as affording a pretext for
<image src="S1V0003P0I0221"/>
<col>413</col>
that aggression&#x2014;for pretences are never wanting where the stronger power seeks to oppress the weaker. Among other things was alleged a supposed indignity offered to the British flag by the Dutch fleet, through which a British yacht was sailing&#x2014;a ground of complaint, by the way, which the wisdom of modern times has taken effectual care shall never exist again&#x2014;how honourably to those who sacrificed this proud distinction, or how advantageously to the country he would not here stop to enquire. But, bad as that case was, it was in one respect not so bad as the case now before the house. No points in difference were at the time under discussion between the two countries, so that the Dutch were not deluded by a shew of negotiation when the attack was made. The recal of Temple, who they knew had too much honor to lend himself as an instrument of treachery to any government, and other circumstances, had warned them of a growing indisposition towards them in the British councils; so that so far from being taken by surprize, they were prepared to encounter an enemy, and the treachery of the attack was in a great degree, and indeed almost altogether defeated. We had, indeed, in this case, the advantage of success, if that success can be counted an advantage which is obtained at the expence of national honour.&#x2014;Before he quitted the subject of precedent, he could not help adverting to a paragraph in the declaration on the table, which he owned had not a little surprized him. It is stated that the arrival of the treasure ships is "an event which has more than once in former times, become the epoch of the termination of discussions and of the commencement of hostility on the part of Spain." If because upon other occasions war has sometimes broken out soon after the arrival of the treasure ships from Spanish America, it be meant to be insinuated, that you have a right arbitrarily to intercept their treasure when it may suit your convenience pending a negotiation between the two courts, he denied the inference as utterly unfair and unjust. Indeed, the proposition was upon the most cursory view obviously untenable. If it were only intended to state, that, in point of fact, war had heretofore followed hard upon the arrival of the Spanish treasure, the remark was surely rather too uninteresting to deserve a place in so grave and solemn a state paper. But he had stated this act to be a
<col>414</col>
violation of the national faith implicitly, pledged. In support of this proposition, he contended it to be a general principle, that when a negotiation is opened between two states for any purpose, but above, all for the adjustment of differences, the negotiating parties are mutually pledged each to the other, to a forbearance from all hostilities until the discussions are finally closed. This principle he should, with the leave of the house, at present take for granted; being prepared hereafter to prove it by the highest and most indisputable authority to be found in the circle of the law of nations. That a negotiation was begun and continued until our minister quitted Madrid, the volume of documents on the table abundantly proved. In the midst of these discussions, which were calculated to lull them into a state of perfect security, whilst the relations of amity were supposed to be still subsisting, your ships received with hospitality in their ports, and the ships of Spain navigating the seas in the full persuasion of that security which nations not at war are intitled to enjoy, you take a treacherous advantage of their confidence, and commit that which is nothing short of an act of open war. You amuse them with a mockery of negotiation, for it is no other than a mockery, if whilst they are lead to indulge a hope, which to the last they reasonably may, that the discussions may ultimately terminate in the complete re-establishment of a good under-standing between the two countries, without any previous intimation to them you send out a hostile squadron for the purpose of attacking an armed force of Spain. The honest satyr in the fable would not endure a guest who had taught his breath to blow both hot and cold; but you commence hostile operations at the very moment when you pretend to be negotiating in the character of a friend; you abruptly cut the kno: which you affect a willingness to untie; you invite them to a parley and you fire upon them under a flag of truce. But here he was encountered by various positions in the Declaration which it might not be improper to notice. There probably would be no difference of opinion upon the effect of the treaty of St. Ildefonso abstractly considered. He could not, however, subscribe to the assertion, that Spain entered into it "for the avowed purpose of endeavouring to subvert the government and destroy the national existence of G. Britain." During the last war indeed, it might be
<image src="S1V0003P0I0222"/>
<col>415</col>
said to have this country for its particular object, but in the contemplation of future wars, the intention must have been to secure to each other a pledge of mutual assistance against any power with whom either of the contracting parties might happen to be at war. But if you think fit to wave that right which the treaty gave you, unless disclaimed, you cannot afterwards in fairness insist upon it, having once elected the line of forbearance. It is stated, that "the groundless imputations in the Spanish manifesto are built upon the foundation of this forbearance alone." He saw no contradiction in this; and here he could not help noticing the manner in which the noble lord (Castlereagh) had misrepresented this part of his hon. friend's (Mr. Grey's) argument. The noble lord had represented his hon. friend to be at variance with himself, because he who, on the one hand, so strenuously contended for the preservation of the neutrality of Spain, on the other hand violently pushed things to the last extremity, by insisting that the treaty should have been considered as a just cause of war. Nothing, however, was more unfounded. His hon. friend's argument amounted to this. The treaty of St. Ildefonso, if acted upon in any manner hostile to G. Britain, if you wish to be inter apices juris, strictly speaking, affords you a just ground of war, subject, however, always to the question of expediency. But you are not justified in suspending this right with an intention of insisting upon it at some future period, you. cannot keep it in petto producible at pleasure when it may suit your own convenience. How is the British envoy instructed to act? Not to make the manly and ingenuous communication in what light the treaty is viewed by his court, but in the cant of special pleading he is directed to protest against the convention. Now is this special pleading reserve, this "<i>pro-testing always</i>" and that too, upon the matter immediately in issue, fit to be introduced into a great political question where the point in issue between two independent nations is no less than that of peace or war? To a question put by M. Cevallos, whether a continuance of the pecuniary succours would be considered as a ground of war, he says "he is authorized so to declare it, and that war would be the infallible consequence." This is categorical and definitive enough. In the very next paragraph, speaking of discussions
<col>416</col>
which took place at a subsequent period, he says, that until the stipulations of the convention between France and Spain are communicated to him, "he could give no positive answer whether the pecuniary succours would be made a cause of war or hot." Now, what is Europe to think of the wisdom of your councils, when there is upon the face of your proceedings so much fluctuation, indecision, and uncertainty, when they see that you have not even the wit to state your own case with consistency? On the 18th of Feb. the British minister declares, that all further forbearance on the part of England must depend upon the cessation of all naval armaments and a prohibition of the sale of prizes in their ports. On the latter of these points a satisfactory answer was given, and as to the former, there was no appearance of naval preparations at that period whatsoever, and it was also very worthy of remark that there was long afterwards as little appearance of naval armaments, as would appear by referring to a dispatch from Mr. Frere to lord Harrowby, dated so long ago as the 5th of July. In the month of Aug. the British charg&#x00E9; d'affaires is stated to receive advice from admiral Cochrane, of reinforcements of soldiers and sailors arriving through Spain for the French fleets at Toulon and Ferrol. Possibly there might be some arrivals at Ferrol, but in the papers on the table there is no trace of any reinforcements reaching Toulon, nor indeed did it appear how they well could through Spain, so that Toulon, it should seem, was ^introduced merely as an elegant expletive. Again, it was stated in the declaration, that <i>towards the end of September,</i> information was received in London from admiral Cochrane, of orders having been given by the court of Madrid for arming without loss of time in the ports of Ferrol, Carthagena, and Cadiz, and the packets as in time of war. <i>In consequence of this intelligence</i> the British minister is directed to remonstrate and demand explanations. Now, the order of the admiralty under which the Spanish frigates were attacked, bore date Sept. the 18th, so that you issue a hostile order to your fleets at the very time when you direct your minister at Madrid to remonstrate and demand explanations. But, what was he directed to demand? "Above all that their armaments should be placed on the same footing as before the commencement of hostilities," not the period of the con-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0223"/>
<col>417</col>
vention, or agreement or understanding, by whatever name it was to be called, as had been conceded to M. Cevallos by the British charg&#x00E9; d'affaires. Now, as this had been conceded, and the British court could not now disavow the acts of their own minister, it was much to be lamented that a condition disclaimed by their own minister should still be insisted upon in the declaration, as it afforded a ground to the court of Madrid to charge the British govt. with a breach of good faith. Again, he was directed distinctly to state the orders of his court to its commander to prevent Spanish ships of war from sailing to or from Petrol&#x2014;Not a word about the treasure ships&#x2014;Lord Harrowby's excuse to the Spanish ambassador seemed perfectly unsatisfactory. If intelligence could not have been conveyed by the court of Spain to the commanders of their treasure ships, the communication from our court would have been useless, and, if it could, the order would have been rendered nugatory. For this mode of reasoning applied with precisely the same force to the other Spanish ships of war of greater force; nor could any sound distinction be drawn between them and the treasure ships. Another ground of complaint alleged in the Declaration was, the removal of Spanish ships out of dock to make room for French men of war. Of this it would be sufficient to say, that the papers on the table furnished no proof of the fact. But it was stated that the govt. of Spain "contemplated from the beginning of the war the necessity of making itself a party to it." The Declaration in the Spanish manifesto is, that from its relations with France it must have with difficulty refrained from taking part against injuries offered to its ally. Whilst they were stating the difficulties they had to struggle with in avoiding offensive operations against G. Britain, was it fair to interpret this into an admission on their part, that they were from the first unavoidably identified with France in the war against us? But "the detention of the treasure ships formed no part of the motive of the previous hostile character manifested by the court of Spain." If any previous hostile disposition existed, that undoubtedly could not be influenced by an affair which took place afterwards. Then it was asserted, that the state of war must have arisen had the detention never taken place. But how did this appear? Other points in difference
<col>418</col>
might possibly have been adjusted, but a breach of faith, and an insult offered to the flag of a generous and high minded nation, do not so easily admit of atonement.&#x2014;The hon. and learned gent. said, he had dwelt the longer upon the Declaration, because that was the instrument which, ministers had offered to the world, and by that they must stand or fall as the justification of their conduct in involving their country in a war with Spain&#x2014;and how vague and unsatisfactory the apology was, he trusted he had sufficiently shewn. But he had undertaken to shew that the attack upon the Spanish frigates, pending a negotiation, was against the express letter and spirit of the law of nations. For this he should rest upon no less reverend an authority, than that of Grotius himself; who, though the first to reduce that valuable science to a system, sprung as it were at a bound to the very top of his art. He says, "sic et qui colloquium aut postulat aut admittit tacit&#x00E9; pollicetur collocutoribus id innoxium fore." He then, as is his custom, adduces his instances, and in the very first says, "per colloquii speciem jus gentium perfidy&#x00E9; violari." Here, then, it was expressly laid down, that during a negotiation you are pledged to do no act of violence to the party with whom you negotiate. Vattel, also, in the case of a contested right says, "after an ineffectual endeavour to obtain justice by conciliatory measures a declaration of war ought to follow, and not pretended reprisals, which, in such a case, would only be real acts of hostility without a declaration of war, and would be contrary to public faith as well as to the mutual duties of nations."&#x2014;Now, if reprisals in such a case be pot admissible, still less can you resort to an act which has in its nature more of violence and outrage than are to be found in any case of reprisals whatsoever. But the character of this measure is not that of hostility, but merely an act of detention. He believed it was the first time that detention had been used to describe such an act since it was first imported into the English language. Here was a regular-action between two opposite squadrons of equal force, in point of numbers, in which 3 ships are taken, a fourth is blown up, and upwards of 300 lives are sacrificed! Yet in the Declaration, and in that house, it was resolutely maintained to be merely an act of detention. Lord Harrow by, indeed, with a manly candour honorable
<image src="S1V0003P0I0224"/>
<col>419</col>
to his character, described the affair in its true colours, speaking of it in his dis-dispatch to Mr. B. Frere as a hostile action in which one frigate was blown, up and 3 were <i>captured.</i> The noble lord in another part of the same dispatch also admitted, that it was foreseen by ministers that the expedition might possibly be hostile and provoke resistance. This furnished matter of grave charge against them for not sending out a larger force so as to preclude the possibility of resistance altogether. As it was, however unequal the conflict might be to any nation encountering us with equal numbers at sea, the Spanish commander, not merely from a sense of honour, but as he valued his own personal safety, was absolutely compelled to fight; for he must indisputably have been shot if he had submitted to such a force without resistance. But what would have been said, if, in the interval between the date of the admiralty order and the time of our minister's quitting Madrid, complete satisfaction had been obtained from the court of Spain? Restitution would have been made! As to restitution of the treasure that was lost, with an overflowing treasury and a bank full of specie (as it must be, for it pays none) perhaps there would not have been much difficulty in settling that account. As to the ships, those that were, taken might be restored, and for that which was lost, we would build them a better, and so that account also would be settled. But there was another account not quite so easy to adjust. Can the sea yield up its dead? How can you make restitution to the king of Spain for the loss of so many valuable subjects, or to the numerous families bereft of so many valuable relations by this rash act of violence and outrage? So much for restitution and detention&#x2014;a detention which is destruction, and a restitution, an offer of that which cannot be restored. But the outrage was not sufficient: after all, Spain was: to be wounded with that cruel and insulting assurance in the Declaration repeated in that house, that the conduct of G. Britain towards her was that of moderation and tenderness.&#x2014;As to the other view of the question, viz. the ground of policy, he could not help thinking that, the war might have been avoided, consistent with the honour and the best interests of the nation. If the friendly disposition of Spain towards this country wagged confirmation, that confir-
<col>420</col>
mation was abundantly afforded by those papers, for a knowledge of which, the house and the public were indebted to the exertions of his hon. friend (Mr. Grey) who moved for their production. (Here Mr. R. read the concluding part of the extract of a dispatch from Mr. Frere to Ld. Hawkesbury, dated 9th Oct. 1803, being No. 8. of the papers delivered to the house 2d Feb. beginning "Your 1dp. may rest assured," &amp;c. and so on to the end of the extract, see p. 179.) Nor did it appear that this friendly disposition had ever been weakened. The pecuniary succours paid by them to France could not be considered as voluntary; they consented to pay them as the price of their neutrality. Still less could they fairly be urged against them by us as a just ground of war, who connived at the same payments made by the Hanse towns, and even by Portugal, our close ally. If we knew them to be oppressed by the domineering influence of France, the comity of nations, and even common humanity should have induced us to consider their embarrassing condition with an eye of indulgence, and should have dictated to us the obvious policy of forbearance and moderation. And if ever there were a period when more than at another, it was our duty and interest to conciliate the powers of Europe by a religious observance of good faith, and of the law of tuitions, this was unquestionably that period. For, able as we were, and he trusted ever should be, to defend ourselves alone, if we hoped to set any bounds to the gigantic and overgrown power of France, that could only be effected by the co-operation of the continental powers, which must arise from the conviction alone that our cause was just. And even if the justice of our cause were mote indisputable than he feared it could be made to appear, we had made an impression upon the nations of Europe highly unfavourable to our honour by the mode in which we had commenced; hostilities, shewing that we were actuated by a sordid thirst of lucre rather than a generous resentment of supposed wrongs.&#x2014;On every ground, therefore, both of the impolicy of the war and the injustice with which it was commenced, the amendment of his hon. friend had his cordial support.</membercontribution></p>

<image src="S1V0003P0I0225"/>
<col>421</col>
faith upon bur part with which the proceedings of this negotiation had been reproached. The relative situation of the two' governments required vigilance, discrimination, and jealousy on our part, and on the part of Spain candour and openness of communication; we discharged our duties, but Spain failed in hers. Charges had been made of long lapses on the part of our govt. during which nothing was done, nor any instructions sent to our minister at Madrid; but it appeared to him, that on the contrary, a regular system was laid down at first, which was followed up from beginning to end, notwithstanding the different hands into which it came, with as little variation as possible. With respect to the treaty between France and Spain, it was evidently pointed against England; it was evident that Spain by that treaty was placed, if not in an actual state of hostility with this country, in a state very near it, and that she could scarcely maintain a qualified neutrality. The refusal to communicate the provisions of that treaty to us rendered it evident that there was something hostile to this country; why should they refuse to make that communication, if they did not know that, from the conditions of that treaty, they must be immediately involved in war? Besides, the subsidy furnished was larger than the force to be supplied, and was evidently meant for the annoyance of this country. Our govt. acquiesced for a time: but it was expressly stated that such a system could not be allowed to be permanent. He did not blame the mode of terminating that discussion, as we certainly had a just ground for war, however some might say that the grounds had been altered. He could not, however, discover any abandonment of our positions, after the war with France, or any agreement that Spain should enjoy the neutrality which she proposed. There was only this, that when our minister confined himself to two specified conditions of neutrality on the 10th of February, Spain might say that every other point was given up, and in this view of the subject he wished that this sort of interpretation had been protested against on our part. He wished that when Mr. Frere found the sense in which his propositions were taken he did not immediately afterwards explain precisely in what sense he meant, them by which all future cavil would have been avoided. The learned gent, had quoted, several authorities, but
<col>422</col>
he wished to know where that learned gent. had discovered that the suspension or no usage of a right extinguished that right; he contended that the direct reverse, was the truth. The subsidy, as he before said, exceeded the contingent; the1 amount of the subsidy might be known by our ministers; but the secret articles of the treaty could not; these were carefully concealed, and for what purpose? was it possible that if it was merely to substitute a subsidy for a contingent, there was any occasion for all this mystery. It would have been an easy task to calculate the sums which ought to be paid for any ships, or regiments, in reals or dollars, but by this denial of communication, Spain confessed that she paid more than her contingent. France, indeed, had given Spain no option, and consulted her own convenience by having the money brought to Paris, where a loan was negotiated for the purpose. The armaments in the ports of Spain had been denied in that house, but were they denied by the Spanish minister? on the contrary, the armaments in Sept. though denied in that house, were not denied by the minister at Madrid, or the; Spanish minister here. They said they were not directed against this country; but we had aright to doubt and to require a different statement of the grounds of these armaments. If they were intended to transport troops from one province to another, why not inform us? Was there any doubt that armaments in Spanish ports might be converted in the hands of France into engines of hostility against this country, and particularly those at Ferrol, and if our minister had not remonstrated against them, would he not have grossly failed in his duty? The ships besides that were used were of a sort never used to transport troops, and in the provinces to which they were said to be destined, there was no convenience for landing troops. These naval preparations on the part of Spain were not deified by the Spanish ministers. But if these measures rendered measures of precaution necessary on our part, this country was not answerable for the consequences; and as to the objection, that a larger force ought to have been sent out, it should be remembered that the treasure was expected to come home in single ships, and that the force sent was amply sufficient to prevent all resistance from a single ship. If it were necessary to stop ships, it was right to use every necessary means to stop
<image src="S1V0003P0I0226"/>
<col>423</col>
them. It had been said that when lord Harrowby came into office, he thought of nothing but the treasure ships; but, if our enemy annoyed us by treasure, it was necessary we should deprive her of those means. Our whole conduct towards Spain had been dictated by fairness and moderation, and we had been gainers by not taking advantage of extreme rights. We were at war, not for any fault of ours, but of Spain. There had been, on her part, a continual denial and refusal of fair and candid explanation. He repeated, that the refusal on the part of Spain to communicate the conditions of the treaty to us, was evidence of its being inimical to this country, which was confirmed by the French general Bournonville refusing permission to communicate it. It were to be wished that a greater force had been employed, but it had been supposed that the Spanish treasure would have been sent in single ships. The question, however, was not altered by that consideration. If it was right to stop the ships, it was necessary to use the force by which they were to be stopped. He considered the detention of the treasure as the act of a wise statesman; that the writers upon the law of nations justified it; and that the refusal of Spain to give the satisfaction required was the cause of the war. By our conduct in not proceeding to those extremities which we should have been justified in recurring to, we had given the world a proof of our moderation. Upon the whole, lie was of opinion that nothing had been done by which the character of this country had been compromised. The hon. gent. concluded by expressing his unqualified approbation of the address.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01191"><member>Mr. Johnstone,</member><membercontribution> in opposition to the hon. gent. who had just sat down, though t the character and the honour of the country deeply compromised in the discussions, the official documents of which were now under the consideration of the house. He would maintain this opinion, although he was ready enough to believe, that the greater part of the country was fond of a war with Spain. The idea of being at war with a power vulgarly imagined to be possessed of immense treasures, was congenial enough to popular sentiment; but he trusted that that house would not allow itself to be hurried away by any such delusion, but examine with the strictest scrutiny the papers before them, ere they ventured to concur in the address proposed by the right hon. the
<col>424</col>
chancellor of the exchequer. He was not unwilling to allow that the treaty of St. Ildefonso might constitute a ground of war for G. Britain against Spain; yet such as it was, it was little more than a transcript of the ancient treaty call the Family Compact, which had subsisted between the different branches of the house of Bourbon silting on the French and Spanish thrones. The articles were of a similar tendency, and yet when this country went to war with France in 1778, this treaty was not considered a sufficient ground to induce hostilities with; Spain, nor to provoke us to take measures such as we lately had recourse to. It was decidedly his opinion, that in the relative situation of the two nations it was clearly the policy of G. Brit, to cultivate a good understanding with Spain, and lord Hawkesbury should certainly have employed some gent. of high birth and conciliatory manners for that purpose. When first the French demand for pecuniary succours was communicated to the British court no expression of their disapprobation followed, and in his mind it would have been much more expedient to allow Spain to pay this subsidy than to force her into a war. He denied the position of the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, who seemed to think that the deduction of one million from the three agreed on for the purpose of paying debts from France to Spain, was immaterial. That right hon. gent. had likewise not fairly estimated the equivalent which this sum bore to the contingent stipulated for. One million was at most not too much for the expences of 15 sail of the line, and the other million which was left for the equipment and support of 24,000 troops was not adequate to the purpose. G. Brit. could not maintain them for twice as much. How was this arrangement at that time viewed by England? Will any roan assert, that it was then the intention of govt. to do any thing more than protest? Govt. had principally argued the point on the instructions and dispatches that passed between our minister at Madrid and his court at home; and not as they ought to have done on the notes and letters that passed between Mr. Frere and the court of Spain. From the tenor of such of Mr. Frere's letters to M. Cevallos, as had been presented to the house, he conceived that that gent. had received his instructions from the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, rather than from the noble sec. of state.&#x2014;The hon. gent. here criticised several of Mr. Frere's
<image src="S1V0003P0I0227"/>
<col>425</col>
notes, both on account of the manner in which they were composed, and of the matter which they contained, particularly one of the 2d Jan. M. Cevallos might well require explanation, as it was written in the most barbarous French he had ever met with. In his note of the 18th Feb. Mr. Frere drops the subsidy, and confines himself to the two points of the armaments, and the sale of prizes in the Spanish ports. After M. Cevallos had twice demanded explanation on this point, its not being pressed is an absolute and unequivocal abandonment of it, and on the 22d of March, M. Cevallos states, that he considers the neutrality of Spain admitted. He was at a loss to conceive on what ground Mr. Frere had couched his note of 18th Feb. in such strong terms. He certainly acted in direct contradiction to his authority; for lord Hawkesbury, in his instructions of the 21st Jan. recommends him carefully to avoid bringing the negotiation to an abrupt termination. It was evidently the system of the then govt. of G. Brit, not to enter into a war with Spain, on account of her subsidy to France. Spain is said never to have given official communications with regard to that treaty; true, but the progress of it was well known, and had been stated in every stage of it by Spain. With respect to verbal communications; if we admit accounts of the conferences between the prince of peace and Mr. Frere, we must also admit accounts of those between our court and M. d'Anduaga. When the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer asserted, that the dispatch of the 29th Sept. afforded full evidence of a determination to revive a subject that had so long lain dormant, it appeared to him to be merely an assertion of the difference between a weak and puerile administration, and that of the rt. hon. gent. Compare these dispatches with those of May, in which our govt. clearly abandoned the subsidy as a cause of war, provided no armaments provoked them to hostility. But, say they, armaments did take place. If they were directed against England, it would require no argument to prove the unqualified right of England to make them a ground of war. What reply, however, did the governor of Ferrol make to the representations that were addressed to him on this subject? That the armament is destined for a secret purpose, but that it needs not excite the jealousy of any European power, the ships being but hall manned. If
<col>426</col>
Spain were disposed to contravene her engagement with this country, French finesse would have suggested a happier mode of concealment. Accompanied as this answer was by the want of preparation in every other port of Spain, its truth could not be doubted. On M. d'Anduagua's being questioned by lord Harrow by, he professes utter ignorance of the subject, and two days after brings an officer belonging to one of the regiments composing the armament at Ferrol, with letters stating that the object of it was to quell the insurgents in Biscay. This, Mr. Frere, in a subsequent dispatch, confirmed, and expressed his conviction that such was the fact. Some of the minister's arguments operated in two contrary directions and destroyed each other. If the agreement to suspend hostilities were advantageous to France, she would not have instigated Spain to break it; if war with Spain were more advantageous to France, we shall be losers by precipitating ourselves into it. It was inexplicable how, on such instructions as were contained in lord Harrow by's dispatch of 29th Oct., Mr. B. Frere could judge himself warranted in making the communication of the treaty with France, and the reduction of all armaments in Spain an ultimatum. The hon. gent. severely reprobated a passage in one of Mr. Frere's notes to M. Cevallos, as being justly offensive to the court of Spain, and disgraceful to the court of G. Brit. It mentioned the influence of France on the Spanish councils, asserted the dependence of Spain on that power, and insinuated the consequent distrust of England. These circumstances were true, but this rendered it more improper to hint at them, and he was well assured that this conduct of the British charge d'affaires was strongly reprobated by the whole corps diplomatic of Europe. But this was nothing to a subsequent part of Mr. Frere's proceedings. He censured the letter of Mr. Frere of the 18th Feb. to the Spanish minister M. Cevallos. He considered it a disgrace to the person who wrote it, and such as never before had been, or ever again he hoped would be, sent by the minister of one great nation to that, of another. Having read it, he said he considered it was a wanton insult of the strong against the weak. Such conduct he knew met the reprobation of those who were best acquainted with the language of diplomacy in Europe. He wished the right hon.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0228"/>
<col>427</col>
the chancellor of the exchequer to consider how he would feel, if such language were held forth to him by the minister of a foreign power; No man was more proud than the right hon. gent. none had more right to be so, because none possessed in a more eminent degree those qualities which raised erne man above another, than that right lion. gent.; but he would venture to ask what would have been his feelings, if any minister had addressed him, as Mr. Frere had addressed the minister of Spain in the letter alluded to? He then proceeded to observe on the inconveniences we had brought upon ourselves by the principal measures we had taken or this occasion. Had we conciliated Spain, its neutrality might have continued, and with a favourable opportunity it might have risen into consequence in the states of Europe; it might have become a powerful, a proud, and independent state, and might have assisted us in humbling the pride of France, but now we had furnished France with, an excuse for overturning Spain with her armies, and, perhaps, destroyed the Spanish monarchy, besides, the consideration of what was due to our ancient ally, Portugal, which by this measure might also be over-run and destroyed, a thing now to be expected. He concluded by saying, that no part of our conduct with regard lo Spain redounded to our honour, on the contrary to our disgrace, such as was regarded by the most intelligent persons on the continent with utter reprobation, for which reasons he must protest against it, and vole for the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01192"><member>Mr. Hiley Addington</member><membercontribution> could not refrain from expressing the greatest salivation at being able entirely to concur in opinion with the hon. gent. who had spoken second in order in the debate of this evening; he wished, however, to add one or two observations to those which that hon. gent. had made on the statements of the learned gent. who had preceded him, and who commenced the discussion of this night. He should avoid adverting to the speech of the hon. gent who had just sat down, not out of the slightest disrespect to that gent. but because to all his arguments, complete answers would be found in the statement made yesterday evening by his right hon. friend near him, and he was, very unwilling to certain the house long, anxious as they necessarily must be, to hear the opinions of so many great and distinguished characters among them, who had not been

afforded an opportunity of expressing their sentiments on this momentous subject. With regard to the analogy which the learned gentleman (Mr. Raine) asserted to exist between diplomatic proceedings and the occurrences of special pleading, and with regard to the construction which he had attempted to put on the different passages that he had quoted from various writers on the law of nations, he would not enter into any dispute with the learned gent. conscious as he felt of his own in competency to the task; otherwise he would not hesitate to acknowledge that the passages so quoted conveyed to his mind a very different meaning, and led to very opposite reasonings. The learned gent. although he allowed that the unexplained treaty of St. Hdefonso afforded a complete justification of war with Spain, yet seemed to wish that something more decisive had appeared in the conduct of the British; govt. to Spain, on the breaking out of the war with France; and that, instead of the forbearance and moderation which had distinguished the conduct of our court to that of Spain, and by which we had vainly hoped to secure the neutrality of that power, we had directed a message to the Spanish govt. requiring a categorical answer, containing a complete explanation how far Spain conceived herself to be bound by the treaty of St. Ildefonso, In this wish he must totally dissent from the learned gent. What would have been the result of such a proceding? What answer should we have received from that court? And what impression could have been made by a demand, calculated to irritate and provoke those whom the learned gent. admitted (and in this point he perfectly agreed with him), it was our true policy to soothe and conciliate. Should we have attained our object? Should we have received a decisive negative or affirmative? The probability is not. The government of Spain would have replied "we have no desire to act up to the conditions of the treaty, we rather wish to avoid doing so, and we ask for time to enable us to concert the best measures for eluding them." Then, had his maj's ministers received such an answer, would the learned gent. have been prepared to advise them to deny the Spanish application for a prolongation of the demand? He rather thought not. He rather thought the learned gent. would have seen nothing in such an answer, but a request from a weak
<image src="S1V0003P0I0229"/>
<col>429</col>
and oppressed govt., which it would have been the highest cruelty to refuse. The result, would thus have been similar to what it had been in the procedings adopted by the British cabinet, with the inconvenience superadded of having causelessly agitated a question, which motives of humanity and prudence imperiously demanded should be suffered to lie dormant. He confessed that he was one who had waited with excessive anxiety for the production of the documents from which alone it was possible to form an accurate judgment of the conduct pursued by the two administrations who shared in the discussions which had taken place with Spain. He felt inexpressible satisfaction in stating, that through the whole course of them, he found the same uniform tone of lenity and forbearance towards Spain. He traced it though all the dispatches from his noble friend Lord Hawkesbury. He traced it in the instructions which proceeded from the late noble secretary of state. He traced it in those emphatic words to our minister at Madrid to "make one more effort if possible to preserve a state of peace with Spain." Deeply sensible as he was of the truth of the facts which he had stated, be humbly presumed to implore the house to pause before they gave their votes for the amendment offered to them. He could not say what were the real motives of the hon. gent. who had proposed it. He had no doubt that they were pure, but be loudly called on the house not to agree to a motion replete in its consequences with injury to G. Britain, to a motion which, if it were adopted, would lower this country in the estimation of all Europe, would lower the spirit of the inhabitants of this country, would unbrace the nerves of every British soldier and sailor now engaged in the protection of Old England, and induce them to believe, that instead of fighting for their country, they are contending in the defence of the most lawless and dishonourable outrage.</membercontribution></p>

Had be done so, at that period of the night, and exhausted as he and the house in general were, he should have confined himself merely to two or three points which had been touched on by his learned friend. Having, however, this night witnessed
<col>430</col>
the cofident tone in which an hon. gent. who sat beside him (Mr. Bankes) had addressed the house, in a speech almost every word of which was built on bold and glaring misconception; when he heard it stated that govt. had acted throughout with humanity and moderation, yet with vigilance, alacrity, and firmness, and, therefore, that gentlemen were not to satisfy themselves of the truth of such allegations, lest they should damp the public spirit, he felt himself called on to enter more at large into the subject, and in the first place to inquire if this was really the situation of that house, that if Ministers chose to plunge into a war on unjustifiable grounds, they were not entitled to inquire into the causes of it, lest in so doing they should damp the spirit of the country! He would never sit tamely in that house and bear it asserted, that we should not disapprove the proceedings of an administration, lest such disapprobation should humiliate the country in the eyes of Europe, and unnerve the arms of our brave countrymen who were engaged in espousing our quarrel. He would tell the right hon. gent. (H. Addington) that the avowal of error, instead of being humiliating, was highly honourable, and that little dependence could be placed on the valour of men who fought blindly, without having entered into the merits of the dispute, and to whom the contest for right or for wrong was equally desirable. He owned he felt the greatest indignation when he heard such doctrine introduced into that house, and he could not refrain from openly avowing that indignation. He would not be deterred from expressing his undisguised sentiments-on this subject, by being told that a Spanish war was popular in this country. He had no doubt that it was popular. He had no doubt that an enemy, rich in pillage, and weak in power, was a popular enemy; but surely, these were not facts to be stated in that house, as arguments to convince them that they ought to connive at fraud and outrage, and abstain from censuring the perpetrators, because their measures were popular. If this was really so, he should wish to be informed for what reason they sat there, and what was the meaning of the bundles of papers in the hands of the members, and lying on the table of the house? The discussions by which this war had been preceded, were said by those who dis-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0230"/>
<col>431</col>
approved of the way in which he thought, to hive been marked by uncommon forbearance, and at the same time, by vigour and energy. There was, however, within the last century, but one war in which this country was engaged in which the integrity of G. Brit, had been questioned, and that was a war against Spain. From this very reason ought we to have been particularly cautious of commencing hostilities against her, unless on the clearest and most undeniable grounds, lest our motives should be questioned. Spain was at the time to which he alluded a more powerful nation than she was at present, and the more were we called on to guard against our integrity being suspected. When a country, like Spain, rich in pillage and weak in power, was seen about to engage in war with a powerful state, it was natural to feel suspicious that her riches and weakness might have contributed to involve her in that situation: and if so, was it not for the honour of the country that the causes of the present contest should be investigated, and our integrity established? When the last treaty of peace was concluded, he had unequivocally stated as an objection to the recognition of it, the subsistence of the defensive treaties between France, Holland, and Spain, and had submitted how far, while such treaties existed, we could, in case of a new war with France, regard those other two powers as in a state of neutrality. Ministers then made light of that objection, but they themselves started it in the beginning of the present discussion.&#x2014;The hon. and learned gent. then went through different points which had formed the subjects of discussion in the course of the correspondence, and contended that on none of them had our govt. put things in so clear and regular a state, as to make them the legitimate subjects of war. By the wavering policy of the late administration, or by their weakness and imbecility or by what other name the present ministers chose to term it, the country had unquestionably been placed in a disagreeable situation, But had the present Ministers extricated themselves or the country out of it, or had they not rather added to the ambiguities and doubts which formerly existed, others of a more extraordinary and more fatal kind? The hon. and learned gent. then made some observations with regard to the dispatches which passed between. Mr. Frere and his May's
<col>432</col>
Ministers, the object of which he could not see, unless it was for the purpose of at once entering into acts of open hostility. He could not help observing a phrase which had been inserted in the declaration: it was agreed, that war was to be declared, in case a French army entered Spain. The word "army" was struck out of the declaration, and "troops" inserted, for the purpose, he supposed, of ministers having some shadow of pretence for the conduct they had been guilty of.&#x2014;He then alluded to Mr. Frere's want of instructions, which he said, were, in fact, nothing, until the very period of seizing on the Spanish frigates. One of the demands made by our ambassador to the court of Spain was, that English ships of war in Spanish ports should be treated in the same manner as French ships of war. This, he said, was agreed to; and, though he did not wish to stand on words, yet, when he saw a demand made and agreed to, he thought it should be binding. It was stated, that, in a preceding war, ships had been taken before the formal declaration; he acknowledged that to be a fact; but it did by no means determine the question, as that very circumstance alluded to, had since been condemned by every man of common understanding. He was sorry to hear so many instances recounted of hostilities being commenced before the declaration of war, as he was perfectly well convinced in himself, that in almost every one, the proceeding was blame able. The hon. and learned gent. then took a review of the law of nations, on declaring war, and quoted several passages from Grotius and other writers. He said, it had been urged, that ministers were justified in going to war on account, of the breach of the condition on the part of Spain. As to that point, he thought the breach must be perfectly clear, which was not, even by the ministers, said to be so in this case; they only said the condition appeared to be broken; but suppose it had actually been the fact, suppose the condition had been broken, every circumstance should have been strictly examined before any steps were taken, or at least, any other than those which were absolutely necessary. He said, the greatest possible argument that could be offered against the war with Spain was, that France would derive the greatest possible advantage from it; she would have under her command, not only the navy and army, but half the revenue of Spain,, all of which
<image src="S1V0003P0I0231"/>
<col>433</col>
would contribute to make her still more formidable than she was at present. The armament at Ferrol, of which we complained, consisted of three ships; the order for fitting them out was received on the 7th, and on the 15th they were countermanded. This was the great and alarming measure, which was to excite so much fear for our safety, and called for immediate reparation and redress. There were, indeed, other armaments that might have proved a just subject of com plaint, and justified strong measures on the part of the British govt. He meant the armaments at Carthagena and Cadiz, and yet there was not a word of alarm respecting these two ports. No orders were dispatched to prevent the armaments from sailing out of the ports of Cadiz and Carthagena. To Cadiz, indeed, 2 frigates were sent to make prizes of vessels that might wish to go into it; but not a word was said of any armament coming out; and, as to Carthagena, no measure whatever was deemed necessary. It was curious to see, out of three cases, two of them thus entirely omitted, and all the fear and Apprehension confined to one. If Spain had a naval war in contemplation, was it probable that she should be totally unprovided with the means of carrying it on? that she should have no timber at Cadiz, until the very last moment? yet such appears to have been her real situation in that particular. So far from having her arsenals filled with naval stores to an extent which the consumption of war might require, she had no timber at Cadiz, but such as was barely sufficient for immediate purposes totally unconnected with the warfare. She had no contracts for naval stores, no provision was made that could indicate an hostile intention. Even Mr. Frere himself had borne testimony to these pacific appearances on the part of Spain, as in one of his dispatches he stated, that from all the information he had received from the coast, it did not appear that there were any armaments going forward. He admitted, at the same time, that another dispatch shortly after announced preparations in the port of Ferrol. He would ask, how were these discordant reports to be reconconciled? The pacific disposition of Spain, if left to herself, was universally acknowledged, and her hostile conduct imputed entirely to the domineering influence of France. But, was it possible that the overbearing influence of France should be so unsteady in its operation, as not to be able
<col>434</col>
to exist ten days together without interruption? It was strange, if warlike preparations were making at any time under the influence of France, always so uniform and steady in her enmity to England, that they should proceed only by starts, and be liable to such interruptions. The al-ledged destination of those ships at Ferrol has also been adduced as a proof of insincerity on the part of the Spanish govt.; and the answer of the Spanish commander, stating that they were destined to convey troops to quell the insurgents in Biscay, has been argued upon as pregnant with internal evidence of falsehood, and totally inconsistent with truth. The subsequent march of the troops for that purpose, by land, was relied upon, as a proof of the fallaciousness of that explanation; but he did not think it deserved so much weight as was attached to it. Although troops were afterwards sent to Biscay, by land, it did not follow but that it might have been thought advisable to have sent troops also by sea, and it was very possible that it might have been in the contemplation of the Spanish govt. originally to send those very troops by sea, which they afterwards marched by land into Biscay. He did not profess an accurate knowledge of the coast of Spain in that quarter disturbed by insurrection; but he could conceive it very possible that it might have been deemed advisable to attack the insurgents at the same time by land and sea; and although there might not be a very deep and commodious harbour on that part of the coast, yet troops might have been very well landed by boats from the shipping at a convenient distance. As a farther proof of the innocent intention of the armament in Ferrol, admiral Cochrane asserted, that the three ships composing it were only half manned. This is at once evidence of the fair intention of the Spanish govt. and of the weakness of the fears which the armament excited. That three ships, half manned, should be a force competent to produce such serious apprehension as would not allow his maj.'s ministers 24 hours time for deliberation, he could not conceive. If they were fitted out for an hostile purpose, and if they did threaten mischief, where was our vigorous and efficient administration of whom we had heard so much? Were they so limited in their means, that they could not afford to send out three ships to prevent any urgent danger to be feared from these three half-manned Spanish vessels? Admitting,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0232"/>
<col>435</col>
however, every possible appearance of hostility to attach to the armament at Ferrol, still it was possible that the object was innocent, and might possibly receive a full and: satisfactory explanation; but, under these circumstances, what course did ministers pursue? They adopted a course that precluded the possibility of all explanation. They sent out orders to the West Indies to Capture Spanish vessels; orders that could not be recalled in time, even in case of a subsequent satisfactory explanation, and were consequently so far final and decisive. In fact, no demand of explanation was made of M. d'Anduaga until the orders were sent off, and explanation must have come too late to prevent their being carried into execution. Leaving the question of explanation, however, aside, he Contended that the Measures adopted by our govt. Ought to have been commensurate with the danger, if any such really existed, and ought not to have exceeded the necessity of the case. Consequently, the act of hostility to which we had recourse, having gone far beyond that necessity, was utterly indefensible. But then we are told that French soldiers and sailors were marched across the Spanish territory to mail the French vessels at Ferr'ol, and that this was an unquestionable breach of neutrality, if put as an abstract, general case. But what were the particular circumstances under which it occurred in the present instance? The Spanish minister declared in his letter, that gen. Bournonville had obtained leave to march 1600 men across the Spanish territory. And Mr. Frere had written to lord Hawkesbury, communicating the circumstance, without receiving in answer any instructions to consider it as an act of hostility. In that light, however, it was afterwards thought fit to view it, for the measures adopted by our govt. in consequence, could be considered as nothing else than acts of hostility. It is idle to call our conduct a system of precaution; it was actual hostility, and is entitled to no other name, Mr. Frere's departure from Madrid was in the same spirit. He was not justified in coming away when he did, as his own dispatch admitted, that the Spanish minister had expressed his hope to be able to shew that the object of the armament was perfectly innocent in relation to this country, and the sincerity of this declaration was the less to be suspected, as Mr. B. Frere had expressed, in one of his letters, his belief that the armament was destined against the Biscayans.
<col>436</col>
With these reasons against an Hostile construction upon the proceeding, and to induce a favourable interpretation, Mr. Frere had no right to take a strong ground, and say to Spain, you shall not move even a single ship out of one of your own ports, even to chastise your rebellious subjects, as if it were impossible that such could be the real object. His own dispatch evidently implied a possibility that an innocent cause might be made out; and if so, he had no right to take a definite and decided step, in opposition to any such possible case. But what followed? Lord Harrow by, in his conversation with M, d'Anduaga, declared that the capture of the Spanish treasure was only a measure of precaution. Was it then right, he would ask, that we should proceed in every part of the world, taking Spanish treasure, although it appeared that the armament was innocent? An expectation, it is said, was entertained that the treasure would Come home from America in single ships, and this had been relied upon as an answer to the objection to the force of the squadron that engaged the Spanish frigates off Cape St. Mary, but the reverse he would venture to state was the fact. Several months prior to that event, information was received, that the Spanish treasure ships would sail in company. An accurate list, containing their names, &amp;c. was published, from whence it appeared, that 5 were to sail together from Lima; and yet, with the advantage of all this knowledge, a squadron of only four frigates was employed to intercept them. So much for the expectation, that the treasure would be brought home in single ships. Let no man suppose that this disparity of force upon the present occasion was a matter of little importance. The honour of the flag is dear to every maritime nation, and, perhaps, there is nothing so likely to involve two countries in hostilities as any insult offered to it. The hon. and learned gent. condemned the conduct of the administration in the most pointed manner, and availed himself of every Opportunity that the papers afforded him to censure their proceedings. When we called upon the nations of Europe to support whatever of civilization there was remaining in Europe, it was necessary that we should endeavour to keep our own conscience free from any acts that could weaken our appeal. We should not seek to relax the ties by which men were hitherto bound to the principles
<image src="S1V0003P0I0233"/>
<col>437</col>
of rectitude. We should not seek for precedents of wrong, nor make cases to justify our own violations. In common matters he would not go against the sense of the house, but in cases like this, it was for the house to consider, whether it would become it to decide without hearing all the arguments that could be offered; for himself, nothing should deter him from saying what his duty and his judgement dictated on an occasion which so deeply involved the honour and character of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01194"><member>The Master of the Rolls</member><membercontribution> said, he would confine himself to the topics which were most important, and which bore most on the issue of the question, without going into the variety of details foreign to the main point into which other gentlemen had entered so much at large. There was much in the conduct of administration, and in the mode in which this business had been managed from the commencement, that might afford room for a great variety of opinions without bearing at all on the main question; but which might yet if much enforced in debate, have great influence on the decision as to that question. These points were certainly much connected with the question, but they ought not at all to enter into the decision upon it. Neither could he see how the dispatches in the early part of the negotiation could be made to enter into the consideration. The war originated in a remote cause, which was the unrenounced treaty of St. Ildefonso, and in a proximate cause, which was the intelligence of the preparation of armaments, and the refusal to explain the objects of these armaments. He conceived we had a right to demand an explanation of these objects on several considerations. First, our situation was to be considered, involved as we were in a war with France. Then, how far our situation with Spain was changed by this war with France, Then, what engagements we had entered into with Spain, whether by agreement or convention, for the name was immaterial, in order to ascertain what we gave to Spain, and on what conditions. Then, whether these conditions were violated, and what consequences, in point of right, resulted from such deviation. Afterwards, the consequences of the claims of explanation, and the amount of the satisfaction given. He understood his learned friend to say, that the treaty of St. Ildefonso did not carry on the face of it a
<col>438</col>
ground of war, if it was not renounced (Dr. L. said, no;) he was happy to find he Was mistaken, and that all were agreed as to the offensive nature of that treaty. According to the law of nations, no treaty was binding, which would bind the contracting party to an unjust war, and the sense of the party was the only thing that could decide as to the justice or injustice. In the Family Compact there was a right of examination and inquiry, but in that of St. Ildefonso, no such right was allowed, This, therefore, was merely an offensive treaty, even according to the opinion of the hon. gent, who had moved the amendment, and a cause of war if it should not be renounced. The mode of proceeding under these circumstances, was to put it to the govt, of Spain, whether it would renounce the treaty or not, and if it did not we would have a just ground of war. There was no difference whether the succours were given in kind or by a pecuniary compensation; our right was the same in both cases, and we were not bound by any agreement between the parties. Nations were not bound to exert their right at all times, or under all circumstances. Considerations of prudence and policy might intervene. This country might not consider it politic to go to war with Spain; and, in fact, the policy of evading a war with Spain when we were engaged in a war with France was recognised, provided we could be sure of a fair neutrality. It was remarked, however, that there was no instance, for near a century, of a war between this' country and France, in which Spain did not sometime or another take a part. Even in the American war, which began in 1778, and was the most unlikely that could be imagined to engage the cooperation of Spain, as being totally foreign to all the principles of interest and policy, she was at length induced, though her ministers at first declared how contrary it was to prudence to make herself a party. The opposition of the time arraigned, ministers on this occasion, for their blindness in not foreseeing that Spain would ultimately take part with France, and for their misconduct in not forcing her to an, explanation. There was nothing that that administration had been condemned for omitting that the present administration had not done. The present treaty between France and Spain was more overbearing than the Family Compact. Ministers had, therefore, taken a distinct line from the begin-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0234"/>
<col>439</col>
ning, and had expressly declared to Spain, that if she executed that treaty, she could have no peace with us. Then it came to the question of the precise amount of the succours. The ambassador was instructed to come to no precise determination on this point, but to take it, as there were many instances in history, of ambassadors being instructed to take the answers given to them on particular points, <i>ad referendum,</i> for the consideration of his court. It would indeed, be too much to give the ambassador himself the power of determining at once on war, or of giving a decisive answer as to the future relations. Here he called the attention of the house to the discussions with Spain in 1761, when our ambassador was instructed to demand a copy of the Family Compact. Lord Egremont, then secretary of state, instructed him at the same time, that if the copy should be refused, but an assurance given that it contained nothing hostile to England, he was to take that answer <i>ad referendum,</i> and to transmit it for the consideration of his court. He never heard lord Egremont censured as incapable or indecisive for this conduct, or because he did not give precise instructions to the ambassador to bring the matter to a decisive issue at once. He already stated; that the substitution of a pecuniary contribution left our right of war unimpaired, Spain preferred that mode of giving her succour in the expectation that the amount would be reasonable, and when France demanded 24,000,000 dollars, the claim was disputed, and its justice calculated by a computation of the expence of the contingent. The demand was however peremptorily insisted on, and being complied with, our right remained the same This Mr. Frere repeatedly impressed when he informed the Spanish govt. that however a small and temporary contribution might be allowed in the hope of new situation of things, which would give room for a real neutrality, in room of the nominal one that now existed, no permanent or unreasonable contribution could be permitted. Was this a ground for conceiving our right abandoned, and for establishing the most dangerous doctrine that had ever been heard, that if a country had a right of war it should immediately go to war to avail itself of that right, and that it was not at liberty to take the chance of events for avoiding the war altogether Mr. Frere held out no hope to Spain but

on the conditions which were thought necessary to assure us. In his dispatch of the 24th Julie, he mentioned, that G. Britain had even then the right of commencing hostilities. The learned gent. here went through the particulars of the discussions between Mr. Frere and M. Cevallos, in which the conditions of an explanation of the terms of the treaty with France, the cessation of armaments, and the prohibition of the sale of captured British ships in the Spanish ports were made the primary conditions of our forbearance. He allowed, that if the conditions proposed were acceded to, it amounted to an agreement. The change of the word to convention, gave rise to an argument which he did not think material. The thing was the same whatever name was given to it. If a word of larger meaning were, after the agreement, substituted by either party, for a word of mere limited meaning, that meaning should be corrected by a reference to original terms. He then proceeded to shew that Spain had not adhered to the conditions proposed by us. He did not contend for any such thing as a reserved right of war to break out at pleasure, and the hon. mover of the amendment was not right when he imputed such an intention to lord Hawkesbury. The letter of that noble lord to Mr. Frere, of Nov. 24, expressed an intention of this kind; but it gave time, and if that time should have elapsed without altering the circumstances, notice was to be given that we could forbear no longer; that we should have a war or a fair neutrality. His hon. and learned friend, who spoke last, had said, in the course of his argument, that it was incumbent on his maj.'s ministers to keep up the good faith for which this nation had ever been so deservedly celebrated; and particularly in its relations with the Spanish govt. He would certainly be at all times a most strenuous advocate for keeping up the good faith and honour, as well as justice, of the nation; and, in the present case, that point had been most scrupulously adhered to. In the course of the negotiations relative to this treaty, we exact two conditions, on the exact fulfilment of which by the Spanish ministers, the whole basis or strength of our agreement, or convention, or compact, for he believed it had been alluded to by all these terms, was to rest. It was necessary, he thought, in this place, to state exactly whit we had obtained from Spain, in order
<image src="S1V0003P0I0235"/>
<col>441</col>
that she might keep out of the war which had just been commenced between France and this country. In the first place, then, Spain was to restrain itself from any appearance of hostile armament. Here again it may, perhaps, be asked, what it was that should be deemed to be such? Mr. Frere, he said, always desirous to do away every doubt that might take place on the subject, had brought it to a more certain point, and, to avoid every probable chance of any mistake, he expressly says, that the court of Spain must abstain from <i>all</i> armaments. This shewed most clearly, that the measure was adopted in consequence of an express agreement on the occasion, which no neutral power could require; as such, lord Hawkesbury, in his dispatches to Mr. Frere, said <i>any</i> armament whatsoever will be a cause of jealousy; and why? for this obvious reason, that if they had any armament at all, it might at any time be brought to act against us. It was hot, he said, by any means his intention to say that we ought to tie Spain down to the Strictest possible performance of that condition. He was far from wishing to infer that Spain should not be allowed to equip any ships, for the purpose of any internal service that might actually require it; such as the conveyance of troops to quell any insurrection or rebellion, or any such a similar service of real necessity. It would first require proof that such armament as that described was wanting; and there could be no doubt, but on the necessity and advantage being made apparent, the king's minister at the court of Spain would readily give consent to every requisite adjustment that the court of Spain could desire. Here the hon. and learned gent. alluded to M. Cevallos's letter, of the 1st of April, in which he states, that his maj. has acceded to the conditions demanded by Mr. Frere; and on the 8th June, Mr. Frere states the conversation he had had with M. Cevallos on the subject. The next proof is M. Cevallos's note of the 29th Oct. in which it is stated, that England agrees to the neutrality of Spain, on condition that she shall cease all armaments whatever, according to the true intent and meaning of the convention. M. d'Anduaga, in his letter of the 22d of Dec. states, that England had agreed to a neutrality on condition that they should cease from all ulterior armaments. Here seemed to be an ambiguous variation of the language in these two let-
<col>442</col>
ters, that of the 29th of Oct. stating, that, in return for the condition of neutrality, Spain was to cease from <i>all</i> armaments, according to the tenor of the convention, whilst that of the 22d of Dec. says, all <i>ulterior</i> armaments. There certainly was a difference in the wording of the two notes, which, with other circumstances, induced a suspicion that the Spanish ministers wished to introduce a phraseology that would bear a difference of interpretation. It has been said by his hon. and learned friend, suppose Spain had occasion to equip ships, in order to suppress a rebellion in any of the provinces: she must not be allowed to equip one for even such a purpose. The hon. and learned gent. denied this, and said it would be unreasonable. It never could be the wish of this country to put Spain into such a situation; but, if Spain were to attempt to fit out any extraordinary armaments, we should certainly have a right to act hostilely towards her. Our situation would certainly not be secure, if Spain were allowed to arm at any time, without explaining. In this view of the subject, he thought he might avoid many of the very minute matters, which the hon. and learned gent. who had just sat down, and some others who had spoken on the subject, had particularly adverted to. His chief object being to impress it on the mind of the house, that we had acceded to a neutrality or forbearance, on the express condition, that Spain should cease from all armaments whatever; and if they broke through that condition, or materially infringed it, that would be a good and sufficient cause of war. We had, in the first instance, it good cause of war in the treaty of St. Ildefonso itself; but as Spain thought they were not bound to act by that treaty, they were strictly bound to fulfil the condition on which they had obtained a stipulated forbearance on the part of this country. How then did the matter stand after this? Mr. Frere received intelligence from admiral Cochrane, that great numbers of French soldiers and sailors were suffered to pass through Spain for the purpose of manning and equipping the French ships of war lying in the port of Ferrol; and further, that Spain was also arming and equipping several ships not only in that port, but in the ports also of Cadiz and Carthagena. The hon. gent. who moved the amendment, had, last night, stated, for what reason he was at a loss to guess, that any
<image src="S1V0003P0I0236"/>
<col>443</col>
intelligence on this subject, coming from that gallant officer, should not be relied on with too much confidence. Why? He thought it, in every respect, to be implicitly relied on. Did it not agree with the account contained in the letter of the capt. gen. of Gallicia, who allows that these are the exact number of ships which have been attempted to be armed, as described by admiral Cochrane, viz. 3 ships of the line. That was, beyond a doubt, a very mysterious armament, and altogether of that kind or description, which Spain, from the nature and spirit of the agreement, then recently entered into with this country, was not, in any manner, warranted to make or attempt. We had a specific agreement, that Spain should not arm at all. An armament is however set on foot. On Mr. Frere's inquiry into the cause of it, he is told that it is for the particular purpose of quelling a rebellion which had broken out in the province of Biscay, and lie thought lord Harrowby was perfectly right, when he said, he did not think it possible that a satisfactory answer could be given on that subject. When Mr. Frere first made the enquiry, no such reason was pretended. He was told, that the armament was entirely laid aside, but that, such as it was, it was never meant with any view whatever that was in the most distant degree hostile or inimical to G. Britain. The first hint which was ever given of its being intended to quell the rebellion in Biscay, appears in the note of M. d'Anduaga here, who suggests, that he cannot conceive for what reason it was made, unless it was to convey troops more speedily and conveniently to the province of Biscay, in order to quell the rebellion then raging there. Here then, the hon. and learned gent, contended, was not only aright to declare war, but a good and sufficient cause of war also, for Spain had procured from you a neutrality, or forbearance, or an express stipulation and condition that she shall positively cease from all armaments, and that condition being once broken in upon, or infringed in any degree, you are in all respects completely justified in issuing the orders of Sept. for the seizure and detention of the Spanish frigates. The hon. and learned gent. went even further, and said that your causes of war were so palpable, that you would have been completely justified in issuing immediate orders for capture in the first instance, which of course includes
<col>444</col>
detention. He did not mean, however, that the measure should be absolute, provided the Spanish court would consent to give a proper satisfaction, and an assurance that it would hereafter scrupulously adhere to the conditions on which the neutrality or forbearance on our part was granted. The hon. and learned gent. fully defended the measure of seizing and detaining these frigates. Yet, he said, it was always intended by his maj.'s ministers as a measure of precaution, though our cause of war was so notorious, for in a few days after the order was issued for their detention, there was another issued for their restitution. Mr. Frere was desired not to consider this step as absolutely rendering it necessary to quit Madrid, but to try every means of convincing the Spanish govt. that we did not wish to break with them if we could possibly avoid it. The hon. and learned gent. insisted that we only wished to detain these frigates as a pledge or hostage till Spain should give us satisfaction on particular points. All the instructions given to the commanders and officers of our own ships clearly proved this; and those commanders and officers had acted with the strictest attention to the orders they had so received. The utmost delicacy was used in the act of communicating those instructions to the captains and commanders of the Spanish frigates; and, whatever melancholy circumstances have ensued were not owing to our officers, but to the obstinate determination on the part of the Spanish commanders, not to submit to the detention, though urged with every degree of humanity and respect; that any lives had been lost, he allowed, was deeply to be regretted; but, under all the circumstances, no blame could therefore be thrown with fairness and candour, because they had taken every precaution to guard against any such melancholy consequences. When the whole conduct of the Spanish govt. is impartially and coolly considered, it will be found that our minister had just cause to be alarmed. The treaty of St. Ildefonso itself was certainly an offensive one, and, as such, gave us a good cause of war in the first instance, even the first moment we found ourselves engaged in hostilities with France. He would, however, suppose, for the sake of argument, that the conduct of the court of Spain only entitled us to make a demand of explanation. Surely, if Spain acted with, due re-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0237"/>
<col>445</col>
gard to the treaty of neutrality or, forbearance, We would not be induced to suppose there was any thing in the treaty which the Spanish govt. wanted so carefully to conceal. But if she gives us reason to suppose that there is any thing concealed, we have an undoubted right to a communication of the terms of that treaty, in order to be certain, and to have it ascertained that nothing injurious to our interests is contained therein. It actually became necessary to know whether the accounts received by Mr. Frere relative to the armaments were true or false. M. Cevallos states, that all armaments against G. Brishall cease, whereas by agreement, all armaments whatever were to cease, and it would be utterly, and to all intents and purposes, impossible for us to know the intentions of the Spanish govt. unless she should give us some information relative to the stipulations contained in that treaty, and therefore you get nothing by the treaty more than you always have had with all neutral nations. The hon. and learned gent, begged the house to recollect that on the 3d of Nov. 1804, M. Cevallos gives in his ultimatum as an answer to Mr. Frere's two notes in the following words:&#x2014;"Sir, I have received the two notes which you were pleased to address to me, dated the 20th of Oct. last, and the 2d inst.; and having given account to the king my master of their contents, I have the honor to declare to you, that Spain has given constant proofs of good correspondence with G. Britain; of her fidelity in observing the treaty of neutrality (called by you a suspension of hostilities, though they have not disturbed the state of peace since the treaty of Amiens), and has completely done away the apprehensions which England founded upon vague accounts of armaments which neither did exist, nor, if they had existed, had any tendency prejudicial to the tranquillity of G. Britain. And although these three points are satisfied in my note of the 29th of Oct. last, still his maj. is willing to make a fresh sacrifice to peace, carrying his royal condescension to the point which you desire, and ordering me to satisfy your questions, as I do in the most unequivocal manner, saying&#x2014;"To the 1st, That Spain, in consequence of the treaty of neutrality concluded on the 19th Oct. 1803, will make no agreement contrary to the said convention. To the 2d, That there is not a greater number of ships armed than there
<col>446</col>
was at the epoch of the said convention. To the 3d, That no change infractory of the neutrality shall be made in the distribution of the ships already armed; nor is it likely that there should be any need to change the said distribution, under the supposition of neutrality. To the 4th, That the treaty of subsidy with France contains nothing offensive to our neutrality with G. Britain, and that the subsidies are equivalent to what would be the expence of the naval and military succours, stipulated in the treaty of alliance with the French Republic. As my answers are not less distinct than satisfactory, for they have been formed in no other style than that, of good faith, I think I have a fresh right to be satisfied by you in regard to the measure taken by the British cabinet in ordering that the commander of its forces before Ferrol should prevent the entrance of Spanish ships into the said port; a complaint I have not had the honour to see satisfied by you, as becomes a measure which carries with it a mistrust of the Spanish govt. and offends its honor and dignity, by shackling the exercise of its domestic authority."&#x2014;By this it appears that Spain, in consequence of the treaty of neutrality, will make no armament contrary to the said convention; this was the explicit language used by M. Cevallos on the 29th of Oct.; but he became more mysterious and ambiguous in the language of his note of the 3d of Nov. which gave Mr. Frere great reason to believe that there was some secret engagement between France and Spain, which rendered it doubtful Spain could not consistently enter into any with Great Britain. That would in itself be a good and sufficient cause of war; they tell us there is nothing in the treaty contrary to the terms of the neutrality with G. Britain, though we have nothing more to depend on respecting this, but their own construction of their own treaty, which they have uniformly refused to let us see, and on which, after the experience we have had, we may well suppose there is no reliance to be placed. Mr. Frere afterwards pointed out, wherein it was, that they might give the satisfaction required in the following terms, in his note of the 30th of Oct.: "true it is," says he, "that his Britannic maj. has received vague assurances as to the amount of the sums paid to France, but these assurances are insufficient to enable him to decide upon the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0238"/>
<col>447</col>
nature of the permanent relations which should subsist between him and his Catholic maj.; especially, as, should these assurances be exact, no reason remains to refuse the communication of the treaty, since your excellency has assured me, that it does not contain any stipulations hostile to G. Britain." Thus, by a full and clear explanation, they might have satisfied his maj.'s ministers, and kept entire those peaceful relations, to keep and maintain which it had been the constant wish of his maj. and the uniform efforts of his ministers. By the conduct of the ministers of Spain, we have had a palpable breach of a particular agreement, made for the express purpose of enabling Spain to enjoy a state of neutrality or forbearance, or rather, as Mr. Frere says, a suspension of hostilities, which is an immediate cause of war; and that event having happened, you had an instantaneous right to detain, or even capture, their ships, without any formal declaration of war taking place. An hon. gent. had characterised the detention of the frigates as nothing less than piracy. But till some new code was established among nations entirely different from that which now existed, he would maintain, it was an act exempt from censure. The non-performance of the condition required, precluded all necessity of a declaration. War was declared by the agreement, on the deviation from the terms. If there was not therefore a right of war on the general ground, there would have been by the convention. It was said, we knew, the contents of the treaty with France. It was true we had reason to presume what the contents were, and the reluctance to disclose them was an additional reason to suppose them hostile to us. Intimation of the general tenor of the family compact was given by the ambassador Stanley very early, but the conditions of it were not made known so soon, and when they were, they were found less hostile than was expected, because they did not involve Spain in the war then existing. There was in both cases a right to demand explanation.&#x2014;Having touched on the most important points, he now, from a regard to the time of the hour, abstained from entering on many, which he would have wished to remark on, as they did not bear much on the main question. He concluded with saying, that laying his band on his heart, he thought the government and the country fully justified in the steps that had
<col>448</col>
been taken; that there was no breach of faith, no violation of the law of nations; but that the honor and character of the nation had been preserved and maintained throughout. He should therefore give his vote in approbation of the conduct of his maj.'s ministers, and he thought they would have been guilty of a breach of the trust reposed in them if they had acted otherwise.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01195"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> then rose. He began by observing, that it was the less necessary for him to occupy much of their attention, since the arguments urged by his hon. friend who moved the amendment remained completely unanswered; and the hon. and learned gent, who had just sat down had not at all succeeded in overthrowing the doctrine laid down in the speech of his hon. and learned friend near him (Dr. Laurence); a speech not only replete with good sense, but what was not less valuable, with the most enlightened and liberal maxims of policy. But what still further superseded the necessity of his going into any length of discussion was, that the hon. and learned gent, had not, in the course of his reasoning, attempted to uphold the distinction betwixt a suspension of hostilities and a system of neutrality, by which we were to be placed in a more favourable situation, and enabled to take whatever advantage we thought proper, whenever a convenient opportunity offered itself. He confessed that the language he had heard on this subject from the right hon. gent. who opened the discussion, and other gent. on the same side, struck him with astonishment. It was neither more nor less than the language of gross fraud. When he heard the right of putting an end to neutrality asserted, just at that period when we could take the greatest advantage of the state with which the neutrality previously existed, he could not help considering it as altogether monstrous. He was happy to find that the hon. and learned gent, had not attempted to support such a doctrine as this, that we should be justified in entering into an implied agreement with another power, by which that power conceived itself safe from attack, merely with the purpose of renewing hostilities, at the moment when they were least expected. He was glad to find, at the same time, that the learned gent. was not disposed to deny the existence of that agreement which some other gent, seemed so anxious either to deny altogether, or to misrepresent its nature and
<image src="S1V0003P0I0239"/>
<col>449</col>
extent. He hoped the house would hear no more of the idea of appearing to acquiesce in an arrangement, and afterwards disclaiming its existence, when some sinister or criminal purpose was to be promoted. He had read in an ancient tragedy of one of the characters expressing a wish to Jupiter, that, for the purpose of preventing the effects of deceit, man had been provided with two voices, the one for the utterance of truth, and the other for the utterance of falshood. It had not, indeed, pleased the governor of the world to form such an arrangement, but if there was not an actual difference of voice, there was an eternal difference of language, and if there was any dictionary for this language it would be important to have it understood, that 'to pass over' was not 'to acquiesce in;' that to wave the exercise of a right was merely to wait for the convenient moment to employ it with greater effect. If he had understood the hon. and learned gent. he confined his grounds of the war chiefly to two circumstances. The first of these he had styled the remote cause, and the armaments in the Spanish ports he had described as the proximate cause of the renewal of hostilities. With respect to the remote cause of the war, he had no difficulty in saying, that if the treaty of Ildefonso was an offensive treaty, and he had also as little hesitation in adding, that he did consider it in that light, its existence was unquestionably a clear ground of war against Spain. The hon. and learned gent. had stated, that this treaty was still more hostile to this country than the Family Compact, as the succours stipulated were to be given without any right to ask for explanation, as to the grounds of the war in which they might happen to be employed. He was not quite sure that in the Family Compact there was an absolute clause to this effect, but certainly this peremptory power of demanding the succours had always been urged as one of the most powerful arguments against that treaty. However this might be, it was not very material to the present argument. But, though he coincided entirely with the hon. and learned gent. as to the right of this country to compel Spain to renounce the treaty1 of Ildefonso, or to declare hostilities against her, he took up his grand objection to the conduct of ministers, in not coming to an immediate explanation on the subject as soon as ever hostilities were renewed between this country and France.
<col>450</col>
Admitting our right to declare war, it became a question of policy whether some arrangement could not be formed by which the good understanding betwixt the two countries might be preserved. Such an arrangement, he confessed, appeared to him consistent with a liberal policy, and ministers appeared to have entertained a similar opinion. When war with France became inevitable, it was easy enough to foresee that Spain must, from her engagement with France, soon he brought into a disagreeable dilemma, and what he complained of was, that no steps were taken by ministers to make provision for the consequences. In the first letter of lord Hawkesbury, he found our minister at Madrid ordered to make the strictest inquiries respecting the views of the court of Spain, and afterwards it did not appear that he ever came to any explanation on the subject. An hon. member on the same bench (Mr. Bankes) had, in his speech, attempted to point out what were the relative duties of the two countries in rather a novel style. He had stated, that frankness, openness, and candour were required of Spain; that vigilance, circumspection, and jealousy were the duty of this country. He confessed he had ever conceived that frankness was a quality which could only be mutual. If we wished others to be frank, we must first be frank ourselves. If we expected full and candid explanation, it was first incumbent on us to exhibit, in our own conduct, proofs of openness and integrity. These observations were founded, not in the laws of nations, or the customs of England, but in the constitution of things, and the laws of our being. Till he had perused the papers on the table, he had not conceived it possible that any lines but two could have been pursued. The first was a determination for instant war. If, on the contrary, a different course was to be attempted, that no time would be lost while the disposition of the Spaniards remained amicable, to conclude any arrangement by which their neutrality might be preserved. What, then, was it that ministers had done to accomplish this most important object? In the month of June, lord Hawkesbury had given our minister at Madrid no powers to form any arrangement; and five months elapsed during which nothing was done, and that when ministers could not be ignorant that French intrigue would be sufficiently active in instigating Spain to act up to the terms of the subsidiary treaty. During all this
<image src="S1V0003P0I0240"/>
<col>451</col>
period there is no communication made, no explanation authorized, no intelligence given to the Spanish court of the objects, views and dispositions of our court. What was here to be concluded, but that ministers believed that Spanish neutrality was intimately connected with the dictates of policy, but had left the whole matter wholly to chance, which every man of common sense saw to be full of difficulty and embarrassment? Not only do five months elapse without any remonstrance or explanation, but this silence is observed at a time when the hope of successful negotiation was by far the most natural. Spain did not attempt to conceal her real situation. She disclosed the demands which France was making, and if we were unable to yield her assistance, she had at least a right to look for our advice for the establishment of her future relations with this country. But what rendered the conduct of ministers the more inexcusable was, that though they knew as far back as the 12th of Sept. and were again assured on the 24th of the same month, that a subsidiary treaty was actually negotiating, they did not make even one effort to prevent such an arrangement from taking place. Under all these circumstances, Spain was now attempted to be calumniated for commuting the treaty, by which a contingent was to be given for a subsidiary agreement. Much stress was also laid on calculations that the amount of the subsidy was greater than the amount which by the treaty of Ildefonso they had agreed to furnish to France. This, however was nothing to the purpose. It was very material, so far as respected France and Spain, though not this country and Spain. The question was, had or had not Spain reason to suppose that the commutation as the contingent for a sum of money would be more agreeable to this country? and had she not acted on the idea that the change would be desirable. Spain took the method of relieving herself from her embarrassments which appeared the most unexceptionable; and if ministers here who were apprised of the step she was about to take, disapproved of it, why did they not remonstrate on the subject? But it was clear, from the language of lord Hawkesbury, that he did not consider the commutation as in, the least objectionable. In one of his dispatches he instructs Mr. Frere, that if on inquiry he finds that the court of Spain had determined on giving the contingent, immediately to demand his pass-
<col>452</col>
ports and quit Madrid; but that if he should find a proposition for a commutation treaty, he should take no steps on the occasion, but report to his court. Was not this a decisive proof in what light ministers viewed the commutation treaty? But now Spain was traduced for subsidising France. The hon. and learned gent, had allowed, that ever, since the family compact there was always a slender prospect of the continuance of peace with Spain, while hostilities existed betwixt this country and France. He had even mentioned that the administration of 1778 had been censured for not foreseeing and providing against such an, event. He thanked God that sooner or later the sentiments of opposition had full justice done them, and he was happy that the opposition of 1805 had left future oppositions an example by which to form an estimate on this subject. He certainly thought that the administration of 1778 was very short-sighted not to provide against the probability of a rupture with Spain. But how much more short-sighted and culpable were ministers now, when the great difference in the state of Spain was considered? Formerly the control experienced was the control of the govt. of France over the govt. of Spain, but was not a control arising from the wishes of the people or the apprehension of a French army taking Madrid. Now, it was the apprehention of being overrun by the French troops, that rendered every act of the Spanish court absolutely dependent. Formerly, there might have been a presumption of a hostile mind. Now, there was not the least room for such a suspicion. It was ridiculous to think of Spain wishing now to share in the conquests of France, or the glories of her chief. The events which had lately happened in Europe, must, he hoped, have cured the inferior states of this triad ambition. But as ministers must have foreseen the probability of a rupture, as they were apprised of the arrangement of Spain to ward off this calamity by a subsidy to France, the question arose out of the extent of this pecuniary sacrifice. Now, it was saying nothing, to say that its amount was larger than the amount of the contingent, because Spain being forcea to have recourse to this expedient, could not prevent this result from taking place. It was well known that the person commuting a contingent for a sum of money, was, to a
<image src="S1V0003P0I0241"/>
<col>453</col>
certain degree, at the mercy of him by whom the commutation is to be received. This was precisely the situation of Spain, but Spain could not in justice he blamed for a circumstance necessarily arising out of her dependant situation.&#x2014;The hon. gent. after again expressing his indignation at the idea of keeping back grounds of offence, went on to comment on the agreement of the 28th of Jan. and confirmed by another letter of the 18th of Feb. by which the payment of the subsidy to France was acquiesced in as a temporary expedient. It was true that Mr. Frere thought proper to deny that there was any agreement, and though it is positively referred to in M. Cevallo's letters, he says his only reason for not protesting against its existence was, that no part of his conversation countenanced the idea. But, surely, this was a curious reason, that Mr. Frere, because he found M. Cevallos labouring under an error, would take no trouble in correcting the mistake. M. Cevallos continues to believe in the existence of the agreement. M. d'Anduaga expressly mentions its existence to lord Hawkesbury, and his lordship never drops a hint of there being no such arrangement. Was it fair, he asked, betwixt man that such an agreement should have been understood to be in existence for a number of months, that the Spanish court should have uniformly acted on it, and that when it suited our Ministers it should be denied? M. Cevallos, in his letters, asserts the existence of the agreement, and explains the two conditions on which it is to continue in force. As to the sale of prizes in the Spanish ports, there were no difference of opinion. The order respecting arnaments was also acceded to, though certainly M. Cevallos contends, and not without great reason, that the armaments should refer to such as were meant to succour France, or to act hostilely against this country.&#x2014;Here the hon. member argued on the state of the enemy's preparation, which never could have excited serious apprehensions. The armaments at Ferrol were quite inconsiderable. They never exceeded three sail of the line, only half manned. They were sufficiently fitted to convey troops to Biscay, and however absurd it might be represented, even Mr. Frere himself, who was not the most disposed to put a favourable construction on the views of the court of Spain, allowed that
<col>454</col>
this was their destination. The orders for sailing from the outer to the inner harbour, were given on the 7th of Sept. and on the l6th they were again ordered to be laid up in ordinary. Here, then, only 9 days elapsed before every source of apprehension from these preparations was removed. No man could seriously believe that Spain had hostile intentions. If any thing had been wanting to convince us of her pacific intentions, her conduct on this occasion ought to have removed all ground of suspicion. He condemned ministers most warmly for issuing those orders which had produced such unpleasant and unfortunate consequences; which had plunged in war two countries having no cause of hostility to each other, without inquiry into the information which admiral Cochrane had transmitted from Ferrol. He meant no reflection on the character of that gallant officer, but he had transmitted erroneous information, both as to Carthagena and Cadiz, in none of which ports were there the least symptoms of preparation. The pacific views of Spain were, indeed, manifest to all Europe, and it was the height of absurdity to talk of her armaments. It had been said by the hon. and learned gent. that the armament at Ferrol was at least mysterious, and remained so. On the contrary, there appeared every reason to believe, that Spain considered that armament no violation of the existing agreement; and indeed its being so speedily countermanded most clearly evinced that it could never have been undertaken on any system of hostility to this country. With respect to that armament, however, lord Harrowby, in his second letter, admits that it might not only be capable of satisfactory explanation, but might even be such as this country would approve its continuance. Much had been said about the refusal to communicate the treaty of subsidy, but, in fact, from what appeared in the papers, no formal official demand of its communication had been made till Oct. just before Mr. Frere's departure from Madrd. Nor was this, in all probability, an accidental omission; for the circumstance had frequently been the subject of conversation, particularly on an interview with the prince of peace, when the latter referred Mr. Frere to the Secretary of state for Foreign affairs, M. Cevallos; and though Mr. Frere had resolved to demand a conference, in order to state the question to
<image src="S1V0003P0I0242"/>
<col>455</col>
the secretary, it seemed that no such conference ever took place. Nor was it perhaps a matter of blame that the official demand of this communication was deferred, because ministers might have seen that, there was no immediate occasion for it. The certainly had it in contemplation, on the recal of Mr. Frere, to send a person every way qualified for the station, Mr. Wellesley, to negociate on the whole state of our relations with Spain; and if that recal was proper, for the sake of avoiding prejudices that might Lave been hurtful to the success of any negotiation in the hands of Mr. Frere, after the difference with the prince of peace, it surely would have been proper also to have recalled his brother, whose connection was calculated to keep alive those very prejudices which the recal of the former was intended to prevent. The demand of the treaty, however, was at last made officially just before Mr. Frere left Madrid, and at a time when it must have been manifest that war was resolved on; although indeed there was nothing in lord Harrowby's instructions that authorized Mr. Frere to leave Madrid, if in the first instance the claims he had been directed to insist on were not granted in all their extent. Besides, though not formally communicated, it was pretty evident that ministers were acquainted with the terms of the treaty, and perhaps too from confidential communications by the Spanish govt. Yet even the refusal of the communication of the treaty could not be considered a justification of the war, so far as the capture of the frigates was concerned, because that refusal was subsequent to the order which produced the capture. It was said, however, that at the period when that order was given, we would have been justified in going to war, and of course were justified in every measure that was short of war. In what light then was the capture of the frigates to be viewed? Was it of war or precaution? If, it was as a precaution, it was to be remembered that there was a most important distinction between detention of property in our hands and an attack on the royal flag of another nation: In the One case property might be restored, but in the other an apology, perhaps of a humiliating kind, might be necessary to v give satisfaction, not to mention the lamentable and unnecessary sacrifice of human lives. The measure, however, seemed to have been considered rather
<col>456</col>
as an act of war than of precaution. What dreadful consequences then must follow, it on the alleged violation of a constructive agreement, loosely worded, actual war were to be commenced? If it was a measure of war, to what purpose instruct Mr. Frere to negociate on the footing of tranquillity, still existing? To what purpose labour lo prolong peace, when war was actually begun? It was like saying when a man had already been hanged, let him still have a fair trial to see whether there was reason to hang him or not. Indeed, there was something in this transaction that equalled in bad faith any of the most perfidious acts of the worst of governments in any age. What instance, unreprobated and uncondemned by history, could be found to justify it? Suppose that discussions existed between any govt; that a public minister was directed to negotiate for the removal of any obstacles that might disturb the existing tranquility: suppose that with much address he had prevailed upon the pride of the other govt. lo submit to concessions, that he had brought them to a temper of conciliation; a post arrives from his court, and those with whom he had negotiated, then imagining that they were to reap the fruit of their concessions, when, instead of the confirmation of peace, it is announced that acts of open hostility had been committed while negotiations were going on upon the footing of actual tranquillity. What must be the feelings of such a govt.? What would be thought of any public minister who could lend himself to such a scene of fraud and duplicity? Is it possible that any person in the rank of a gentleman could descend to play so unworthy a part? Yet, what was the fact here? Had not the Spanish frigates been captured, and was not Mr. Frere instructed to negotiate as on the footing of uninterrupted peace, and to bring matters to an arrangement, altogether keeping out of the view hostilities committed? He had no doubt, therefore, that Mr. Frere must have been imposed upon when employed to carry on a negotiation, concealing from Spain so important a fact as the capture of their frigates by an act of open hostility. What could have been the avail of any arrangement concluded while, that fact was unknown? Must it not have broken up what had been done? Was it not, therefore, in itself nugatory, and to the Spaniards most insulting, to negotiate with them, conceal-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0243"/>
<col>457</col>
ing so important a circumstance? Were similar treatment to be experienced by this country from an ambassador negotiating in such a situation, it would be doubtful whether the ambassador, to use a phrase of Mr. Frere's, would escape with impunity, from the more liberal spirit of the mob. Was there any good precedent for such a proceeding, and if there was any but those accursed precedents already alluded to, let it be pointed out? If it was a measure of war then that the Spanish frigates were captured, it was in pursuance of a system of policy altogether irreconcileable to good faith. If it was a precaution, it was not a measure that partook of the nature of precaution, because measures of precaution were directed only against particular dangers, but the danger from the Spanish treasures or Spanish power, were dangers not existing at particular moments merely; but dangers of that sort that were to be removed not by precaution, but by war It appeared, too, as if ministers had felt some remorse for what they had done; for they gave orders not to attack merchant ships carrying treasure or stores, though if it was necessary for our self preservation to prevent stores and treasure reaching Spain in king's ships, it was equally necessary to prevent their being conveyed in merchant's ships. What was called indulgence, therefore, was only a modification of what was felt to be unjust, in order to mitigate its odium. With respect to the necessity of declaration of war, though wars had been commenced without declaration; yet, the best authorities stated it to be most eligible to declare war first; and there was an instance at the commencement of that glorious war which began in 1702, that the govt. then, by a public proclamation in the gazette, ordered all ships seized and detained previous to the declaration of war, to be released, as was stated in the proclamation, "in pursuance of the law of nations."&#x2014;There was only one more observation he had to make, and it was on the menace or caution to the opposition, not to damp the courage and zeal of the public, by censuring the conduct of govt. or arraigning the justice of our cause! But if those on his side of the house were not convinced (and it was not in a man's own power to be convinced) of the wisdom of administration, or of the justice of the war, what was he to do? Were they to speak and vote against their opinion, to be silent, or to leave the house? Had not his majesty by submitting the papers to their
<col>458</col>
consideration, called for their fair unbiased opinion; and such an opinion they were bound to give. The reputation of parliament was of the first importance to the public interest, and that reputation could only be maintained while parliament continued the faithful council of the king and the upright guardian of the state. What could tend more to damp the national spirit, and to make them question the resolves of parliament, than a supposition that they did not speak or vole as they really thought, but were influenced by patriotic fears of making unfavourable impressions on the public mind? As, however, both in public and private life sincerity was the source of confidence, and in order to convince men of one's sincerity it was necessary to be sincere, he conceived it his first duty to declare his real sentiments, and to lay before his majesty his real opinions. Thinking the administration culpable in the conduct of the negotiation, and in the war with Spain, he saw no reason why be should not by his speech and by his vote express those sentiments; he should therefore give his most hearty assent to the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01196"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;After the length of time, sir, which this business has already taken up, and more especially after the able and luminous point of view in which my opinions on this subject have been placed by my hot), and learned friend (the Master of the Rolls), the impression of whose speech I hope still remains with the house, notwithstanding the attempt which has been made to destroy it, I do not see any necessity for troubling the house much farther in detail. Yet, late as is the time to which the discussion has been protracted, I trust I shall meet with the indulgence of the house, while I shortly advert to some leading points that have been brought forward relative to the conduct of govt. some of them referring personally to myself. The first point, then; to which I would turn the attention of the house is, the attempt which has been made to represent my hon. and learned friend and myself as differing somewhat in our opinions relative to the commencement of the war with Spain, whereas, in fact, no difference ever existed; and my hon. and learned friend has only rescued the arguments which I made use of from the vulgar and wretched misrepresentation to which they have been exposed. An attempt has been made to prove that I and lord Hawkesbury were so mad as to say to Spain, "we shall forbear to exercise our rights
<image src="S1V0003P0I0244"/>
<col>459</col>
against you for a time, and at any subsequent period, we shall, when we find it convenient, commence hostilities without any further notice." We said no such thing. If we had, then we should have deserved all the abuse and derision which have been so liberally poured upon us. But as we never did, all the abusive, and vulgar terms employed against us may be retorted on those who could be guilty of so glaring and so gross a misrepresentation. This, sir, was what I advanced: I said that though the sum paid by Spain to France was enormous, yet we had maintained a system of forbearance for a time, reserving however to ourselves, at any future period, to consider the subsidies as a cause of war. This was certainly fair and just; but did I ever say hostilities were to be commenced, in the above case without notice? No; we said this to Spain: "when you tell us that you wish to gain time, and have some hopes that you will speedily be in a situation to maintain a strict neutrality, we shall forbear for a time, that your chance may be allowed you, and every opportunity of keeping out of the war granted." But when we had given them this advantage, and when they had this opportunity long enough, then we say this, "thus far shall our forbearance go, and no farther; and now we tell you that from this hour that forbearance is at an end." But while I beg that this may be considered as my opinion, do not let it be understood that Spain was harshly limited in point of time. For when the above declaration was coupled with a condition, who could deny that the violation of the condition constituted a good ground of war without farther notice? We said to Spain "we forbear in order to afford you an opportunity of maintaining your neutrality, if any possible change should enable you to do so; but if, in the mean time, you go on with ally armaments, then this will be considered as tantamount to a declaration of hostilities." If, then, the Spanish govt. violated the conditions upon which our forbearance was founded, can any one here to-day tell me, that in that case a fresh declaration was necessary? This, sir, is what I said, and do still say. Even allowing it to be only our simple declaration, the question is still the same. Our right, whether she liked it or not, remained equally entire. But, in addition to this, they declared their intention to accede to these terms; and if any thing
<col>460</col>
could strengthen my case, it is that circumstance. From the discussion of this point, and others equally important, gentlemen start to find fault with the conduct of their country. I have no objection to the quarrels with these papers, and the causes of the war. Let them proceed in their own way; no one has any desire to stop them; but I do say, that they have uttered sentiments unfavourable to their country, founded on nothing else than the miserable and wretched confession which they attempted to produce in our statements. Whether or not this is a conduct consistent with their duty to their country I call upon that country to judge. These mild advocates for peace, these pretended enemies of war, have little or no hesitation in adopting any mode of argument or making any assertion, provided they succeed in thwarting the measures of govt. or in censuring the conduct of those entrusted with the direction of public affairs. That system of patience and forbearance, which, in my opinion, in this instance, is so honourable to his majesty's servants, has been the subject of irony and ridicule with gentlemen on the opposite side of the house. But that forbearance we had resolved to carry to a certain extent, and no farther. We had given intimation to this effect to the Spanish govt. and we consequently were not to blame for acting as the emergency required. We had frequently apprised them of the danger of forcing us to a rupture; and his maj.'s servants shewed a degree of forbearance which evinced their wishes to prevent the effusion of blood, by recommending a strong adherence to the conditions of the neutrality; they certainly deserved praise, not censure. Whatever gentlemen might allege, the Spanish govt. by a violation of those conditions, had rendered themselves liable to our explanation of their conduct, consequently to all the consequences of a rupture, should that be deemed unavoidable. After the warnings which we had given the ministers of the court of Spain, they were at last subject to our discretion. That lenity and moderation, however, which had marked our conduct towards Spain, continued till our interest and honour were endangered, and thence arose the war, and from, thence we may date all its consequences. When I find the hon. gent, and his friends endeavouring to circulate topics of detraction on this
<image src="S1V0003P0I0245"/>
<col>461</col>
occasion, it is necessary for me to set myself right against such misrepresentations. The cause of this war has been denied. That cause, however, was very obvious, and the agreement or condition of neutrality having been once violated, that circumstance formed the basis of the war. What were the conditions? The arguments of my hon. and learned friend have so clearly defined them, that to go over the same grounds would only serve to weaken their effect. The hon. gent, has insinuated that my hon. and learned friend argued only from a loose conversation. That gent. is not very apt to argue from such weak materials; and, therefore, I must take the liberty of denying the truth of his allegations. The conditions of the neutrality to which I am obliged so often to recur, are so clearly expressed, that little or no doubt can be entertained on the subject. They positively declare that there shall be no armament, as an armament would be considered a sufficient cause for war. If there were no conditions expressed or understood, as the hon. gent. has maintained, any argument on that head would be ridiculous in the highest degree. It was also stated, that should there be at any time a violation of the conditions of neutrality, that would not only be a cause for war, but for an immediate war, if decreed necessary, and that no declaration would on such an emergency be requisite. Mr. Frere therefore found himself necessitated to give intimation to the court of Spain, that, until a satisfactory explanation should be given, the alternative of war must be resorted to. Gentlemen are therefore mistaken when they suppose that we have been guilty of any act of precipitancy towards Spain. She had sufficient notice of our resolution to proceed to war, unless prevented by a satisfactory explanation. But it was not only evident that such an armament as that alluded to was preparing with every expedition, but that it was destined to unite its strength to that of the enemy. As the British govt. had warned Spain of the consequences if she persisted in those hostile preparations, the latter was therefore responsible for all the calamities which might ensue. We had something more, substantial than mere appearances; for to have acted on mere appearances, without the best and most convincing proofs, would have been childish in the extreme, and justly deserving of the ridi-
<col>462</col>
cule and indignation which the hon. gent. on the opposite side bestowed on the supposed errors of govt. The gentlemen on the opposite side, have denied that there were any good grounds for the military contingency of which govt. complained. They admitted that in Biscay troops had been sent by land, but then the cause assigned for the assemblement of these troops was the insurrection in Biscay. It was curious to see how the gentlemen changed their opinions concerning the information which they received. Whenever it was convenient, they denied the validity of the intelligence received through the medium of adm. Cochrane, but admitted that of Mr. Frere. The adoption of this principle arose from their sometimes finding that Mr. Frere's information made for their argument, and that adm. Cochrane's made against it. It was thus they pretended to disbelieve the facts advanced by the latter respecting the armament. The gallant adm. gave this notice to govt. when stating the existence and nature of this armament: "most of the crews live in the vicinity of Ferrol; and they have, it is said, leave granted until the 15th of next month. I must, however, remark, that they can be assembled at any time within a few hours." Was not this ample evidence of the armament? It was pretended never to have been fitted out against us, although no other explanation has ever been since given. Another point put by the hon gent. is upon the situation of Spain. He asks whether we can believe that Spain would go to war at a time when she was smarting under all the miseries of pestilence and famine? The hon. gent. observes, that on the subject of the Family Compact their rights were concerned, and they had an object to look to, and that they might adopt the views of France, but now they have no such motive, but on the contrary they are suffering from French connection; that they now dread France; and which I believe they do, as much at least, if not more, than they hate her. Do we know so little of the conduct of the govt. of France as to suppose-that the inconvenience, the distress, or the misery of Spain would be a reason that would operate in the councils of France against her passion, her caprice, and her inordinate and extravagant ambition? She felt that circumstances gave her an opportunity of indulging either. Are we so lost to all means of conjecturing how she would
<image src="S1V0003P0I0246"/>
<col>463</col>
conduct herself towards others, when their blood or their treasure was at stake, when we know how little regard her chief has for either the treasure or the blood of the people of France, when any favourite plan is within his view? Are we to suppose, therefore, that he would be tender of the blood and treasure of Spain, when on so many occasions he has been so wantonly prodigal in the expenditure of the blood and treasure of France, to accomplish any favourite object? To think so, would be singular indeed; but gentlemen say, that France had already got the use Of all the money of Spain, and therefore she would not take her contingent also; and the hon. gent, did allow the possibility of this, although he thinks it a very extravagant supply. Perhaps, says he, you may say France may desire to have the command of both. Why yes, sir; we may say that perhaps she may desire to have both; and the more especially, at the very time when this negotiation was depending. And here I would ask gentlemen on the other side, if France thought that in a few weeks she might strike a blow, by which she might gain a temporary advantage against this country, or an expected advantage over our squadron, then blockading her port, by forming a junction between that of Spain and her own, would they believe that she would forbear doing so on motives of tenderness to Spain? But the hon. gent. endeavours to anticipate this observation, and to obviate its force by asking, how can you think so, when the treasure ships of Spain were then on the ocean, and when a junction, or an attempt to gain an advantage over us, would be putting the treasure of Spain, so much wanted by France, in jeopardy? It does happen that some of them had arrived, with the treasure consigned to France; and that a few more were expected soon to arrive. As we were very near the place of their ultimate destination, and apprised of the supposed time of arrival, we thought there was a chance of their not reaching their port without our interception of them. We knew the chance was small; but small as it was, we thought it worth the trial, and accordingly an order was given that the trial should be made. It was made, and it was successful; for they were met within sight of the harbour of Cadiz, and if we had been 24 hours later, they would have arrived safely in their destined harbour, and then, in addition to
<col>464</col>
the armament which the hon. gent. would have us suppose was not intended against us, under all the circumstances of the case, France would have had these million's of money in her coders. They expected to arrive safely, but fortunately, by extraordinary exertions, we were too quick for them, and we did prevent their going into harbour by taking them.&#x2014;Next then, sir, the hon. gent, comes to a statement of that which has been fully discussed already, by others as well as by myself; namely, the circumstances under which we had taken this measure of precaution, and on which I say we have proved that our right to intercept these ships was legal. The hon. gent. attempts to deny this, by saying it was a measure of absolute war and not a measure of precaution. Now, I say, that if it were not a measure of precaution, but of absolute war, as the hon. gent. states, his conclusion would not follow, because I contend we were justified in taking a measure of absolute war, and this indeed seems to be admitted by all the gentlemen on the other side; but it is contended, that although we were justified in taking a measure of absolute war, yet in doing something short of it, we were not justified. Now, I would ask, is there any thing repugnant to common sense in the principle which says, that if you are justified in going to the last extremity, you may do something short of that extremity? The hon. gent. insists, that we are not to take reprisals without a declaration of war. Here the whole point turns on the application of the term, reprisals. If he means taking property, wrongfully, that is, without a right of proceeding to hostilities, he is right. The taking the goods of an enemy, after that enemy has taken our goods from us, is properly called reprisal; but the taking of our goods before they fall into the hands of your enemy, is not a reprisal, and here, I believe, the hon. gent. will find, under the authority of Vattel himself, that keeping reprisals as pledges for a security against supposed hostilities, is lawful; that is, security against the supposed intention of the enemy. There, are cases in which the highest authorities state, that the forcibly taking them back before the adjustment of disputes, is a justifiable cause of war; but here we may dispense with the whole of that part of the argument, because we gave a regular notice of, war, and said, that unless the conditions were observed, we should take every mea-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0247"/>
<col>465</col>
sure either of war or precaution, reserving to ourselves which; but the hon. gent. says, that the Spanish court never could suspect we should have detained their property. Why? What should make them think we should not, after the notice they had, and after they had afforded and were continuing to afford to France such enormous pecuniary succours, in addition to all the naval force she could command; thereby carrying on against us a double warfare, contrary to all the rights of neutrality. Now, if one of these be sufficient to entitle us to proceed to war, it will hardly be contended that uniting both together will take away our right. Could it then be matter of surprise to Spain, that we should have taken the measures of precaution we did? Will it not be admitted that it was a duty we owed to ourselves to intercept this treasure; for can any one in this house be ignorant that it is by means of dollars from South America, that Spain affords pecuniary succours to France? As to what they thought of that succour, it is a matter about which it is not our business to enquire. But the matter does not rest there. When we were reasoning on the treaty of St. Ildefonso, I think in the month of July 1803, when Mr. Frere was stating to the Spanish minister the forbearance of this country, what did he say to the Spanish minister? He desired him to mark the generosity of his maj. in not claiming their treasure, as he might have done, but that he let them receive it, at that time it being understood that they would act with more strict justice to the system of neutrality. What was the answer of the Spanish minister? The answer was in substance an acknowledgment of his. maj.'s lenity and generosity, and this is now turned against us, and because an end was put at last to such generosity and forbearance, in consequence of several breaches of the conditions on which only it was to be continued, and of which due notice was to be given to Spain, our measure of just and necessary precaution is termed a breach of faith; by turning round as it is called upon Spain, and attacking her when she was unprepared. Among the grounds of uneasiness which Spain expresses in the months of Feb. and March, is the inconvenience and hardships they suffer on account of their apprehension for the safety of their treasure ships coming from South America; then, how could they say they were taken by surprise, since they were apprehensive at
<col>466</col>
that early period that to this our attention would be directed, if ever their breach of the conditions should induce us to proceed to hostility against them, or to take any measure of precaution for our own security; and after such notices and violations of the conditions of his maj.'s lenity and forbearance, will any man in this house deny we were entitled to proceed by force, even if attended, as it was unhappily attended, by the consequences of battle? Was not the notice, that if they committed: any further breach of the condition of such lenity and forbearance we should declare war, sufficient to put them on their guard? And was it not milder in his maj.'s govt. in taking these few ships of force, than if it had taken all the merchantmen to be found on the seas belonging to the court of Spain, the right to which is unquestionable? Then the matter comes to this, that having a right to make war, yet his maj. true to the principles of lenity and forbearance which had so long distinguished his conduct towards Spain, had not at last recurred to the full exercise of his right, but only took, measures of prudent and necessary precaution; that is to say, measures to prevent the situation of England being worse, and France better, during the interval of a negotiation, and by which war might after all have been avoided; but the hon. gent. says, that this negotiation was a mockery, and that the measure, which we call a measure of precaution, was an act of perfidy. The hon. gent, insinuates, that we are ashamed of our own act, and that we should have proceeded at once to war, instead of this measure of mockery of moderation and lenity, if we found that we were entitled to do so; that is, in other words, that what we have done for the preservation of our national interest, is worse than actual hostility and open war. If this be true, I shall beg the hon. gent; to consider how valuable a discovery he has made by finding out that it is less dangerous to plunge a nation irretrievably into the calamities of war, than to afford it a chance of averting them by an adherence to justice. The hon. gent, blames us for believing hi the truth of the account we had of the preparations of the enemy, and on the evidence we had to support the credibility of that account; but if any thing came afterwards, to corroborate what happened at the time we had said we would not make use of the information we received, I wish to know whether gentlemen on the other side would
<image src="S1V0003P0I0248"/>
<col>467</col>
adhere to the rule of justice on which they now wish to proceed? Suppose we had acted as they say we should have done; suppose we had permitted this half-manned fleet at Ferrol to come out; suppose we had suffered these two millions of treasure to go into Cadiz, and from thence, as of course it would, to the coffers of France; suppose the two fleets of France and Spain had joined; suppose, what indeed is not probable, but still possible, that being so joined, and superior in force, they might have defeated our blockading squadron, or had by winds favourable to them, and adverse to us, they might have crossed the channel, and had brought a large fleet of transports, and, proceeding in an expedition against Ireland, had eluded the vigilance of our fleet, and that, under a junction of favourable accidents, had been able to effect a landing there; and suppose it had been our case to day, with the intelligence of Admiral Cochrane, which is now condemned by the gentlemen on the opposite side, to have appeared in parliament, after neglecting the precaution, and after suffering the serious and alarming evil to have reached us, by waiting for the explanation from Spain which the hon. gent. recommended, and which would take six weeks, or two months to have arrived, when, in the meantime, the enemy had executed partly his purpose of invasion; suppose we had come to parliament to be excused for having relaxed our efforts, and laid our case before these friends of humanity, these advocates of energy and vigour, what would have been the language of these gentlemen if we were to throw ourselves on the lenity on the house? The case is, however, thank God, at this time, very different indeed. It is owing to that vigilance and activity which the hon. gent. and his friends have so severely condemned. It is to that spirit and energy that we are at this time to attribute the independence, if not the salvation of our country. I now, without further discussion of the causes of the war, submit the case to the judgment of this house, to the judgment of the country, and to the judgment of the whole world.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01200">The farther consideration of the appeal cause, Lucina <i>v.</i> Craufurd, being resumed, several points arising out of the case were, on the proposition of the Lord Chancellor, ordered to be referred to the consideration of the judges, who attended for the purpose.&#x2014;The Earl of Enniskillen, one of the Irish representative peers, and the Earl of Kellie, one of the sixteen Scots peers, were sworn and took their seats.&#x2014;Counsel were heard in continuation, on the Irish appeal cause, Fairfield <i>v.</i> Morgan, viz. Mr. Parke, on the part of the respondent; after which, the farther consideration of the case was deferred till Friday.&#x2014;The exchequer bills bill, the assessed tax commissioners, and the annual indemnity bills, were read a second time, and severally committed for to-morrow.&#x2014;Mr. Williams, secretary to the commissioners of naval enquiry, presented the tenth report of the said commissioners, which being laid upon the table, was on the motion of the Duke of Clarence, ordered to be printed. After a few words from his R.

Earl Camden objected, that the illustrious person who had just spoken, had stated no parliamentary ground for the production of the papers moved for. The Duke of Clarence said, he should not press the motion, but his object was to obtain information as to the total deficit in the army, which was a subject, he was afraid he should have frequently to exercise their lordship's patience upon in the course of the session.&#x2014;His R.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01201"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> said he should have to call their ldps'. attention to a point of considerable importance: it would refer principally to the exercise of the discretionary powers vested in the crown, by the suspension of

the habeas corpus bill in Ireland. In that view he moved an address to his majesty, praying that there may be laid before the house;&#x2014;1st, an account of the number, names, &amp;c. of persons confined under the act for suspending the habeas corpus in Ireland;&#x2014;2dly, an account, &amp;c. of the persons from time to time discharged from such confinement;&#x2014;and 3dly, an account of the conditions upon which such persons were discharged.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01202"><member>Lord Hakesbury</member><membercontribution> observed, that, with respect to the first and second heads under which the noble lord's motion was classed, he had no objection to producing the statements required; but, with regard to the last head, he thought the case was very different, and that a sense of duty impelled him to object to it. The act in question vested a discretionary power to apprehend and detain, without bringing to trial, persons, who, there was reason to suspect, were guilty of traitorous practices; and a disclosure of the conditions upon which any of those persons might be discharged, under the circumstances of the time, was so obviously objectionable, upon considerations of prudence and policy, that he deemed it unnecessary to take up the time of their ldps. in demonstrating it. At the same time, he was not prepared to say, nor did he mean to state, whether or not there were any persons in the predicament assumed by that part of the noble lord's motion; but, to contend, that, if there were, it would be impolitic and imprudent in the extreme, to agree to that part of the motion, which, if pressed, he felt his duty to resist.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01203"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> replied, that, in consequence of what had just fallen from the noble sec. of state, he should, for the present, wave that part of the motion. However, he begged the noble lord to consider farther of the point, between that, and some future day, whether it was right to persist in refusing to lay such information before parliament? In his own mind, it was highly proper; and it was his intention, therefore, to bring forward a motion to the like effect on u, future opportunity.&#x2014;The question was put on the first and second motions, and they were ordered accordingly.&#x2014;Adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01207">Sir Evan Nepean moved the order of the day for the 2d reading of the bill for further suspending the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland, for a time to be limited. On the question being put from the chair,</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01208"><member>Lead Henry Petty</member><membercontribution> rose and observed
<col>474</col>
that this was the second time, during the short period he had had the honour of a seat in parliament, that the house had been called on to pass a measure of this sort, in respect to Ireland. He could not but lament that the house should be called on the present occasion, to adopt a measure of this nature upon such extraordinary grounds, or rather upon the absence of all ground whatsoever; for all enquiry as to the necessity of passing such a law, had been peremptorily refused. He would not pretend to say there was no possible case that could exist in which the house could be warranted to adopt such a bill without enquiry, as certainly a case might occur in which the notoriety of public danger was so palpable to every man as to supercede all necessity for enquiry: but did such a case exist at this moment? If it did exist, it must exist in the dark; and if there was sedition in the country, it must be secret; and before the house was called upon to pass a bill for suspending so important a branch of the constitutional law towards the people of Ireland, it was incumbent upon those who brought it forward, to prove that necessity, and upon the house to go into enquiry, before it was induced to adopt the measure. If danger or sedition did lurk in any part of Ireland, it did not follow, that a measure of so much severity ought, therefore, to attach upon the whole country. But his maj.'s ministers had adduced no proof that the mischief had existence in any part of that country. Without due proof of such evil existing, the house was called upon to refuse the measure; and if any ill consequence should occur from such refusal, the blame ought not to attach upon parliament, but upon his maj.'s ministers, who shall not have brought forward the proofs necessary to justify parliament in passing such a law. But in the present case, at a notice of 24 hours, the house was called on to adopt the measure; and when his maj.'s ministers are asked to bring forward the proofs of the necessity, they answer, "proofs are not necessary. Depend upon it the danger exists. Depend upon it the powers conveyed by this bill will not he abused in the lenient hands of the present Chief Governor of Ireland." But was this, he would ask, the language for ministers to hold to parliament, or upon which that house would feel itself warranted to act, for the suspension of, the constitutional liberties of the people of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0252"/>
<col>475</col>
Ireland? He trusted such a species of unproved representation would never be admitted by that house as a justification for placing the liberties of his maj.'s subjects at the arbitrary disposal of any individual, however respectable; and no man entertained higher personal respect for, or a more exalted opinion of the lenient character of the noble lord at the head of the Irish govt. than he did. But it was not in the power of one or two individuals at the head of affairs to attend to every particular case throughout the whole extent of Ireland, especially when all the passions of individuals were alive, and personal animosity was seeking to wreak its private revenge by means of aggravated and frequently unfounded crimination. Could these one or two upright individuals in the situation in which they were placed, apply to every case the same impartial justice, and the same fair examination which would be given by a jury of 12 men deciding on all the circumstances? It was impossible they could, and yet this was the sort of substitution which the house was called upon to sanction without any inquiry whatsoever. It was matter of notoriety, that, even under the mild and moderate administration of the Marquis Cornwallis, characterised as it so eminently was by caution, by deliberation, and by lenity, yet many persons suffered punishment under existing prejudices, misrepresentation, or false proofs, whose innocence was afterwards fully demonstrated; as was instanced in the case of the Rev. Mr. O'Neil, of Youghall, the mention of whose very severe sufferings did so much honour, on a former occasion, to the feelings of a right hon. member who noticed the subject. Numbers of cases were also extant, even in the history of this country, to shew that arbitrary power had rarely been placed in the hands of individuals without being abused; and even going no farther than the administration of the Alien Bill, how many hundreds of innocent individuals have suffered, even with the best intentions of his maj.'s ministers, through the false or malicious misrepresentation of enemies. And if such abuses could occur in dispensing a law to a few aliens, how much greater was the liability of such abuses under a law attaching upon the millions that compose the population of Ireland. The noble lord did not mean to deny the possibility that sufficient cause for such a bill might exist;
<col>476</col>
all he meant to insist on was, that there was wanting the notoriety and publicity of any existing cause that could warrant the legislature in passing such a bill. He should, therfore, whenever the bill came into a committee, move that its operation be limited to two months, unless satisfactory proofs should be adduced to shew the necessity of its longer duration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01209"><member>Mr. Ker</member><membercontribution> said, that no man more seriously deplored than he did the necessity for calling on parliament to pass such a bill; but he was still convinced, that necessity was imperious and pressing. The house would recollect, that when a similar bill was brought forward, in the year 1802, arguments precisely similar to those offered this night by the noble lord, were opposed to it by those who could not be induced to believe in the lurking sedition then brooding in Ireland: but, unhappily, the dreadful rebellion which burst forth in the Irish capital, in the summer of 1803, but too strongly verified the apprehensions of those who were advocates for the bill, of which number he was one. It was for the want of such power in the hands of the magistrates that year, that sedition had gone such lengths, and that sedition would again gather new strength, if not timely prevented, by renewing those powers' which were not likely to be abused in such hands as those of the nobleman now at the head of the Irish govt. the moderation and lenity of whose measures had shone so eminently conspicuous. In that part of the country with which he was more immediately connected, he was happy to know that the utmost loyalty and tranquillity prevailed; but he had lately heard that some resolutions of the magistrates of the county of Waterford had been published, in which they state their determination to apply to govt. to revive martial law, if the seditious did not desist from their daring conduct. He had thought it his duty to make some enquiry on this subject, and several gent. assured him the advertisement he alluded to did exist, and was called for by the sense of the magistrates as to the state of the county. He appealed for the truth of this statement to an hon. bart. opposite (sir John Newport), who had delivered his sentiments on the subject on a former evening. Such, he was convinced, was the existing necessity which called for this bill, in many parts of Ireland, that numbers of those who had been formerly most clamorous against it, were now most
<image src="S1V0003P0I0253"/>
<col>477</col>
earnestly anxious for its adoption; and so far from being deemed a grievance by the loyal inhabitants of the country, nothing more acceptable to them could be done than to pass this bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01210"><member>Sir John Newport</member><membercontribution> said, that being called on by the last speaker, he should offer a few remarks in support of the consistency of the opinion he had formerly thought it his duty to deliver. He did not deny that there were appearances of disaffection in some parts of Ireland, but he never could admit the principle, that because one part of a kingdom was deficient in the duty they owed to their king and country, the whole kingdom was to be placed beyond the pale of the common law of the land. He was aware of the proceedings to which the hon. member alluded, but he thought that they afforded no reason whatever for the measure now before the house. The fact was, that the principal offenders in the county of Waterford were now actually in gaol and liable to be tried by the judges of assize. It was not therefore to be argued, that the proceedings referred to offered even an excuse for a bill which had a tendency to place the whole people of Ireland beyond the protection of the common law. On a former day he had not argued that the measure in question was unnecessary, but what he called for was an inquiry to demonstrate its necessity. Nothing short of a notoriety extreme and uncontradicted, could, in his opinion, justify this measure, and conceiving that this necessity had not been made out, he had moved an amendment, the object of which was to institute that inquiry, by which only a fair decision of the house could be formed. He wished the business to be probed to the bottom, and he never would submit to the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, unless on the clearest grounds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01211"><member>Mr. Pytches</member><membercontribution> opposed the bill. It was, he said, highly improper to pass a measure of this sort without a previous inquiry. He would ask any dispassionate man, whether it was fair to the people of Ireland to treat them with less respect than the people of G. Britain? This bill was sown in suspicion and reared in jealousy, and might be attended with the greatest miseries to the people of Ireland. The only reason for all this was the traitorous committee at Paris. By the total omission of any mention of Ireland in his maj.'s speech at the opening of the session, he
<col>478</col>
was inevitably led to conclude, that no doubt whatever was entertained by his maj.'s ministers, of the settled loyalty and tranquillity of Ireland; but an act like this was more likely to produce tumult, than prevent it. It was time to put an end to the gestation of imaginary conspiracies, generated in the fancy of bed-ridden dotage. It was no time now to play the fool with Ireland, or to treat her inhabitants like froward children. The consequence must be, that instead of cementing the union, we should only open a gash between the two countries, which no plaisters, nostrums, or medicaments of any sort could possibly heal. The best policy would be to encourage in the minds of the people a manly, natural, and independent spirit; otherwise the Union, which was designed to unite their affection and energies with our own, must prove not only inefficient, but afford a constant source of jealousy and dissention.&#x2014;The question that the bill be read a second time was then put and carried without a division, and ordered to be committed for to-morrow.&#x2014;Adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[CONDUCT OF EARL ST. VINCENT.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01212"><member>The Duke of Clarence</member><membercontribution> observed, that on a former evening, a subject was agitated, which was of that nature, as that not only upon public grounds, but from his private feelings, he was induced again to call the attention of their Idp.'s to. He alluded to the circumstance of his noble friend, (earl St. Vincent) then in his place, having enquired, whether it was in the intention of his maj.'s present ministers to investigate any enquiry into his conduct, while he held the high situation he had lately filled under his majesty? He had known the noble earl during twenty-six years, and though, on some certain points, he had had occasion to differ from him, yet it was always with the deepest regret. However, while at the head of the board of admiralty, the conduct of his noble friend was such, that he should defend it, if necessary. Seeing a noble viscount in his place (Sidmouth), who was lately at the head of his maj.'s councils, and at present held a high situation therein, he would beg leave to ask the noble vise, plainly and decisively, whether the noble vise, could say, or could not say, that, so far from, its being

<col>479</col>
the intention of his maj.'s present ministers to institute any enquiry into the conduct of the late minister for marine affairs, that here existed no ground for setting on foot an enquiry into the conduct of one of the most honourable, dignified, and illustrious naval heroes of the country:</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01213"><member>Lord Sidmouth,</member><membercontribution> after shortly adverting to the point, how far he might be warranted in point of parliamentary usage and practice, to answer, in his place, queries of such a nature as that put to him by the noble duke, stated, that with respect to the particular question which his R. H. did him the honour to ask, he had no hesitation in saying (and if he had any hesitation in saying, he should belie every feeling, both private and public, which he possessed with respect to the noble earl, and which all those who knew his character arid conduct must feel) that in his conscience lie believed there existed no ground or reason whatever for enquiring into the official conduct of the noble earl; but, on the contrary, he thought him every way entitled to the approbation and the gratitude of his country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01214"><member>The Duke of Clarence</member><membercontribution> replied, that he never yet heard any answer within the walls of that house, which had given him such complete satisfaction, as well in a public as a private point of view; he should therefore, on that subject, never more trouble their ldps. Before he sat down, however, his R. H. observed, there was another question of importance, and which he would wish to have decisively answered; namely, whether it was intended by ministers to make any alteration in the system of the volunteer corps? He rather put this question to his maj.'s secretary of state for the home department; because he conceived the description of force in question was more particularly within the province of that minister. He should possibly have occasion to move for the production of certain documents on the subject; but at present, he would simply ask, whether or not it was intended to make any alteration in the volunteer establishment of the United Kingdom.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01215"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> observed, he would not then enquire how far it could be expected from him, upon' parliamentary grounds, to answer to such questions as those put by the royal duke. He should now only observe, that, if it should be the opinion of his maj.'s govt. that any further alteration was necessary or expedient to be made in the volunteer, or any other ser-
<col>480</col>

<title>[REPEAL OF THE ADDITIONAL FORCE BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01218"><member>Earl Darnley</member><membercontribution> rose to make his promised motion for the repeal of the Additional Force bill. He said, that with respect to the topic which their ldps. would more particularly have to discuss, it would not be necessary to occupy much of their time. He conceived, that on that head, to call their ldp.'s attention to certain effects of the measure, would alone be requisite. In viewing the subject before them, it would be necessary to advert to the situation of the country at the commencement of the war; a period at which the necessity of strong and energetic measures was universally acknowledged, and the measures which were then resorted to, were submitted to' without murmuring. The administration which succeeded the last, to a certain extent thought a change in the military system of the country expedient; and their prominent measure, in endeavouring to effect this, was the bill then under consideration. These ministers, in that respect, notwithstanding the magnificence and extent of their promises, and the strong and eloquent language in which one of them in particular reprobated the measures of their predecessors as weak, futile, and inefficient, had in their remedial provisions entirely, but above all, in
<image src="S1V0003P0I0255"/>
<col>481</col>
the measure under inspection, disappointed the expectations of an anxious and confident public. Their professions and promises were magnificent and gigantic, their performance diminutive. The present act emphatically illustrated this position; and when their ldps. considered what was said when it was first ushered into parliamentary notice, and compared its effects as they appeared in the documents before the house, the language of the poet might well be applied to it: "Parturiunt monies, et nascitur ridiculus mus."&#x2014;His ldp. proceeded to state various instances in which the measure under consideration had completely failed. In one particular county, where the numbers expected and prescribed to be raised by the act were 1097, no more than 14 men were obtained. There were other cases in which the inefficacy of the bill was manifested nearly as much. What was expected of the parish officers, events had proved, was beyond their power to perform. He contended, that the sense of the country was against the bill, as a practical measure, and adverted to the great number of the representatives of this part of the United Kingdom, who opposed it in the first instance. A great stress was laid upon the support the measure would receive from the influence and personal exertions of individuals in different quarters. This expectation had been miserably disappointed. In proof of which, his ldp. Referred to the case of the Cinque Ports, in which there was raised by the parish officers, but a single man. Let their ldps. but consider the circumstances of this case; who the lord warden of the Cinque Ports was, the exertions which should be expected from him, in support of the measure, and his power and influence in that particular quarter; and, if, under such circumstances, in a place where so many men were expected to be raised, only one man was to be found, it was a most unfavourable symptom as to the general efficacy of the measure. Where then have vanished all his boasted promises? Were promises nothing? And here the noble lord thought he might be indulged in a few observations upon the language then held out by the present ministers, in declaiming on the incapacity, and reprobating the measures of their predecessors. And who are the persons who compose the present administration, that have so successfully substituted vigour for weakness, talents for incapacity? Does not the majority of the present
<col>482</col>
administration consist of those very persons who, when in place, were branded with imbecility? The nature of the change which formed what is called the present administration, afforded much disappointment and regret to him; much surprise and disappointment to the country at large. But what must now be the astonishment of every man, when we behold at the head; of his maj.'s council, that very person whom his present vigorous and enlighten* ed colleagues then held out to the world as the very child and champion of incapacity itself. The measure, however, which that child of incapacity produced, was vigour and efficacy itself, when compared more especially with the measure now under discussion, of which so much had been so boastfully promised, and of which so little had been reduced to effect. In the course of eight months, by certain parts of the accounts, it appeared that no more than 1295 men were raised, and of these, the number applicable to general service was only 343. In fact, not above the twentieth part of the expected number had been procured. It would be a misuse of their ldp.'s time to argue for the inefficiency of such a measure. And this was the only proof they had had of the vigour and energy of that administration, so high in their vaunts, and so gigantic in their promises. In saying this, he meant nothing personal to his maj.'s present ministers, for many1 of whom he had the highest respect. But he held it to be his duty, as a peer of parliament, and an hereditary counsellor of his sovereign, to speak the sincere conviction of his mind, as to their public measures. These, however, were such, as when he not only considered them in their effects and consequences, but, when viewing what bad passed and what had been said upon-the subject, he considered of what materials the present administration was composed, he felt it his duty, upon public grounds, generally and systematically to oppose them. He condemned many of, their hostile and offensive operations, particularly the catamaran expedition. He thought it would be sufficient to rest the merits of what be should propose upon the documents which were then before the house; the consideration of these would be sufficient to convince the house of the inefficacy of the measure, and induce them to repeal it. With respect to Ireland, its inefficacy and objectionable tendency was not less apparent. Upon the whole, from what he saw of the effects of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0256"/>
<col>483</col>
the bill, and from his conviction of what should be expected from it, he could with confidence propose to the house to expunge it from the statute book; and, under such impression, he should conclude by moving for the repeal of the said act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01219"><member>Earl Camden</member><membercontribution> rose, fie observed he had listened with attention to the speech of the noble earl, and to him it appeared to be intended rather as an attack upon his maj.'s present govt. than as applicable to the measure in question; this he was the more induced to think, when he considered the allusions made to what had passed the last session of parliament, and the line of observation in which his noble friend indulged himself throughout. Will respect to the bill itself, he was rather obliged to his noble friend for bringing it under consideration. In considering the bill, the peculiar and extraordinary circumstances that preceded it, and which, to a certain extent still continued to operate, should be fairly considered. He was aware that, to a certain extent, endeavours had been made to counteract the operations of the bill; and these views would be rather forwarded, than otherwise, by the holding forth the idea that the measure was not likely to be persisted in. He differed widely from his noble friend in his opinion of the measure, as he knew that it was not only an efficient, but, he believed, it was likely to prove a very beneficial measure; at the same time he admitted, that the numbers at first expected were not raised under the bill. &#x2014;But when all the circumstances under which it was to be carried into activity, were kept in view, this was less a matter of surprise, as time was necessary to give it a fair chance of success. He had thought the army of reserve act a good measure for giving a large and speedy augmentation to the regular army. But it was not denied, that the army of reserve act was accompanied by many inconveniencies, which it was very desirable to remove. It had been particularly the means of introducing high and unprecedented bounties. Government perceived the necessity of destroying this evil if it could possibly be effected, and the expedient which they had fallen on to accomplish this object was the very bill which the noble lord proposed to repeal. The numbers which had enlisted from the army of reserve into the regulars was a conclusive proof of the general principle on
<col>484</col>
which the bill was founded. But the bill held out, not only encouragements connected with the Army of Reserve Act, but others peculiar to itself. It was founded on the aid of local influence and strong public zeal, and he was confident that, if both these were properly applied they could not fail of producing the most important effects. If these were at any time, or in any district, totally dormant, the penalties which the bill inflicted, where the quota was not furnished, would furnish powerful means of recruiting for general service. The manner in which the bill was drawn offered strong inducement for the exercise of patriotism, and when properly understood, he had no doubt of its answering every object for which it was originally framed. If the bill were now repealed, the consequence must be that recourse must be again had to those high bounties to which the army of reserve had given rise, and to that system of balloting which it was allowed on all hands should be abolished as equally impolitic and oppressive. He was sorry that the merits of the bill were so much confounded with the character and merits of the administration. The noble lord who opened the business had described the measure as. a decisive evidence of the inefficiency of that administration which had held out such mighty promises to the country. He had, at the same time, argued, that such an administration as that now presiding over the national councils, was not such as the people required, or the state of the empire demanded. It was painful to him to dwell on a subject so personal, but he felt it to be due to himself and his colleagues in office to state, that if all the circumstances attending their acceptance of office were developed, much of the obloquy heaped on them would be spared. They had obeyed the call of their sovereign, from a sense of duty; they had not sought office from an inordinate thirst for power; they had not been hostile to that extended administration which the noble lord had declared to be, what the country expected; but they could not, consistently with their public feelings, refuse their services at a moment when they were called for by the sovereign at a difficult and trying crisis. The noble lord might lament the absence of an extended administration, but he had no right to arraign his maj.'s ministers for the arrangement, such as is now existed. But returning to the immediate question
<image src="S1V0003P0I0257"/>
<col>485</col>
before the house, he conjured their lordships hot to listen to a proposition for repealing the bill, at the time that it was beginning to produce the effects to be expected from it. Noble lords when they talked of the state of our military force, did-not seem to be aware how much had been added to it in the course of the last year. This number was no less than 28,000, of which number there were no less than 18,000 for unlimited service. When noble lords objected to the small numbers raised by this bill, they ought to bear in mind, that at this moment there were nearly 800,000 men in arms. It was not, therefore, at all a matter of surprize that men were raised with difficulty, and he was sure that the amount of the men raised last year was no sort of proof of want of activity on the part of the executive government. An impulse had been given to the recruiting service which, if suffered to go on, would, no doubt, be productive of the best effects. To repeal the bill would be to interfere with this impulse, and under this conviction he felt it his duty to resist the noble lord's motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01220"><member>The Earl of Suffolk</member><membercontribution> declared, that he could not discover from the documents on the table, where that large increase to our military force alluded to by the noble lord was stated. He saw only a statement of a few thousand men raised by the bill in the different parts of the United Kingdom. To talk, as the noble lord had done, of the effects of zeal and personal influence in insuring the success of the bill, was quite nugatory. The experiment of the effect of these had been tried, and bad been found inefficient in producing the end in view. In proof of this, the noble earl stated, that in that district in which the personal influence of the right hon. author of the measure chiefly lay, only one out of the quota of five hundred men had been obtained. It was quite clear from the past, that nothing had been effected by the bill, and there was very little hope of much good resulting from it in future. Being a bill totally useless in the attainment of its object, and being attended with many oppressive circumstances, he should certainly vote for its repeal, Before he sat down, he only begged leave to say, that if our force was really so much increased as had been described, the merit of this augmentation belonged to the late administration, and not to his maj.'s present ministers, It was not therefore either fair
<col>486</col>
or just to claim the merit-of services in which others were solely interested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01221"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> was anxious to know on what grounds ministers were desirous of resting the merits of the bill. He wished to understand whether they meant it as; a bill for recruiting our army, or a bill for raising money. If they meant it as a bill for raising men, it was clear, from the returns on the table, that it had completely failed. Ministers then, by opposing its repeal, certainly now meant it to be considered as a bill for raising money. But it had been said by a noble lord opposite, that if the bill was repealed it would be necessary again to have recourse to the ballot. He, for his part, professed himself no friend to the ballot, but in proposing the repeal he was convinced that his noble friend merely meant to pave the way for a complete review and amendment of our whole military system, and the adoption of such arrangements as would necessarily preclude the appearance of the ballot for ever. The noble lord next wished to know whether the idea of enlisting men for a limited period was to be acted upon, and contended, that the experience derived from the army of-reserve act was a sufficient proof of the inadequacy of such a measure. This inference he could not for a moment admit. Because men were trepanned, as it were, from one service to another, this, was no proof that the system of enlisting for a limited period would not, if well arranged, be of infinite advantage. His lordship complained, that the failure of the bill in producing the quotas required must be felt highly oppressive in many parts of the country. In the county of Surry the fines for deficiencies amounted to upwards of 21,000l. On a calculation 25,000l. would amount to 1s. 6d. in the pound, imposing a burden on the landed interest greater than that which arose from the property tax. The right hon. author of the measure had, previous to his coming into power, talked of nothing but increasing the disposable force of the country. Not a moment was to be lost in gaining the object, and surely it was not asking too much from him to require that in his hands this object should be constantly and steadily pursued. Not a month was to elapse before the army was to be placed on that footing which the circumstances of the country required. But what had, ministers done since their accession to Office to effect this great object? They had literally
<image src="S1V0003P0I0258"/>
<col>487</col>
done nothing. Instead of the recruiting of the regular army, their whole attention had been occupied with catamarans, or other equally futile experiments. While the concentration of the national force was totally neglected, the attention of ministers was engrossed by ridiculous projects, and all this from men who were to exalt the amount and character of our disposable force, to a point of unprecedented glory. With all their boasting, they had done nothing, and those ministers whom they had traduced as the weakest and most inefficient of rulers, had now obtained as complete a triumph over their accusers as if they had actually returned to power. Yet after such decisive evidence of the inadequacy of the measure, he was astonished to find the noble lord declaring that it was the intention of ministers to persevere in it. But the house was told that the differences which formerly stood in the way of the bill were now done away, and that henceforth local influence and personal zeal would produce astonishing effect. Their lordships certainly had no reason to be very sanguine, from the experience of these circumstances, on which the whole efficacy of the bill was grounded. It was not a little remarkable that in Kent, where the influence of the noble lord (Camden) might be supposed lo be powerful, only 11 men out of the quota required had been procured. In the North Riding pf Yorkshire, with which another noble lord (Mulgrave) was peculiarly connected, not even one individual had been procured under the provisions of the bill. Was it not pretty conclusive evidence of what was to be expected from the continuance of this nugatory and oppressive measure? It was, however, on such grounds as these, that their lordships were called on to resist the repeal. Even previous to experience, a majority of the representatives for this part of the kingdom had voted against it, as wholly inadequate to the object which it professed to have in view. It would be unaccountable indeed, if they should now alter that vote, after the grounds of it had been so completely established by experience. Viewing the bill in this light, he most cordially acquiesced in the motion of his noble friend, and hoped that a majority of their lordships would see reason to vote for the repeal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01222"><member>The Duke of Cumberland</member><membercontribution> begged the attention of the house for one moment. Some (expressions had fallen from the noble lord
<col>488</col>
who spoke last, which he, consistently with the rank he had the honour to hold in the army, could not silently pass over. He must protest against the idea of any man whatever being trepanned into his maj.'s service; if he thought the bill had such an effect, he should be one of the last to support it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01223"><member>The Earl of Westmoreland</member><membercontribution> said, that no correct opinion could be formed of the bill, of which so much complaint had been made, without attending to the state of the country at the commencement of the war, and to its immediate situation when the bill was passed. Prior to that event, the military forces were very considerably reduced, and the extraordinary means that tere employed to restore the army to its former establishment, on the spur of the occasion, suddenly dried up those sources from which abundant supply might have been expected. That they must have been exhausted was obvious, when noble lords adverted to the prodigious number of men raised in a very short interval. The army of reserve bill raised of the militia alone 50,000. In addition to these, 46,000 were raised for more permanant duty; and, in the whole, in the short space of 15 months, 200,000 individuals were united to the national force. The unavoidable result of this sudden accession, was those excessive bounties, the inevitable consequence of which had been truly stated. It became absolutely necessary to discontinue the expedient of the ballot; it would neither procure the men, nor could the country bear the weight of this species of exaction. Such, then, was the state of the country, and such were the impediments to former plans, at the time when the present bill was, proposed: in fact, the anterior project was no longer operative, and some new; scheme must be adopted. Then this measure was proposed under the following recommendations: 1st, it was to suspend all balloting; 2dly, it was to relieve the parishes and individuals under an insupportable burden; 3dly, it was to raise a body of men, better disciplined, and in greater number, than under the former expedient. It was by these tests the bill ought to be examined. If it had answered any, much more if it had fulfilled all these purposes, ministers would be entitled to credit for having proposed this mode for the benefit of the service, He could by no means agree with a noble lord (King) who represented this bill as opposed to the sentiments of the coun-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0259"/>
<col>489</col>
try; he trusted it had given much, satisfaction; at least of this he was confident, that the former bill, however effectual for a time, had, from its increasing oppressive tendency, excited general discontent. The bill now under consideration had some times been opposed on constitutional grounds. He well knew the language of the bill of rights, that there should be no army without the consent of parliament. Such, he contended, were the forces raised under this bill; because they were subjected to the mutiny act, and were thus periodically subject to the control of parliament. The objection, therefore, on this ground, must be acknowledged to be unfounded. While he would admit the application of every constitutional principle, he must likewise attend to the. public security, as it would be affected by the reduction of tire public force at the present time; and lie would frankly and boldly declare the crown was not sate on the head of the sovereign, if the force were not provided which it was the object of this bill to acquire. If the country had been exposed to danger, it was because this beneficial plan bad not been earlier resorted to, and it was most unreasonable to expect its immediate operation in all its extent. Time must be allowed to dissipate the effect of the former exorbitant bounties, and to admit the country to recover from the drains by which its resources had been exhausted. But this interval was not to be unemployed. The reduced militia was to supply the regular army, and a further source was to be acquired from the army of reserve. Then time must be granted for the meetings of the commissioners of the parishes; yet, before it was possible that all the multifarious parts of tins scheme could be organized, it seemed to be expected that the whole operation should be discovered. Under these circumstances, the fairest way to estimate the progressive importance of this bill would be to consider the 2 last weeks as a specimen of its efficiency. The number raised within this short interval was 600 men, which would amount, in the course of the year, to 35,000, if the future weeks were equally productive. It was frequently the disadvantage of a measure, in itself conducive to the public good, that it so far interfered with others, that the advantage derived from it was counter-balanced by this interference. Such an objection could not apply to the present bill; it had been found to obstruct no other service, but rather
<col>490</col>
to co-operate and assist, than to interrupt and oppose.&#x2014;Adverting to what fell from noble lords, at the other side, expressive of their present opinion of part of the existing administration, he observed, it was not very long since some of them, at least, held a very different language. With them the talents and eloquence of the present chancellor of the exchequer, the vigour and energy of his character, if brought again into administration, would restore the tarnished honour of the country, and revive its drooping spirit. They waited but for his return to office, to effect all this. His powers, in that respect, seemed to be regarded by them, as not inferior to those attributed to Jupiter in the Heathen Mythology. Did he once appear, new life and vigour would be infused into every branch of the military service, and every department of the state: but, by some unfortunate and then unforeseen accident, like the ephemeral properties of a meteor, these admirable qualities seem all eclipsed, in the eyes of those whom he alluded to. Let the noble lords explain the causes of these apparent alterations, if they can. The interruptions which they were pleased occasionally to offer, should not perplex him, or draw him from the chain of his argument. He contended that the measure in question, so far from prejudicing or interfering with the other branches of the recruiting service, would contribute to give them additional efficacy. The noble earl observed, that the charge of coalition proceeded with an extraordinary ill grace indeed, from some noble lords opposite to him. Political men, without hazard of very severe censure, might coalesce, who had only differed respecting this or some former bill; but it would require all the ingenuity of the noble lords opposite to give a satisfactory and convincing reason, why those should coalesce and unite who had pointedly differed upon every topic and upon every principle which had come under consideration, ever since their political existence.&#x2014;Recurring again to the subject under consideration, he contended that the effects of the bill, as far as it had, had a fair opportunity of operating, were beneficial; that from recent circumstances, and by what they had to look to prospectively, there was every right to assume it would be still more so; that, as the military force at present stood, the troops were equally fit, in point of preparation, for limited or general service; and that there was
<image src="S1V0003P0I0260"/>
<col>491</col>
every prospect of their being able, chiefly through the medium of this bill, to get a very large disposable force. The measure of repealing the bill would, under the present military system, be hazardous in the extreme; the frame of the existing military establishments would be shaken by it: were they prepared to repeal the present militia acts, the army of reserve, or to restore the former practice of ballotting? All these important queries should be satisfactorily answered, before they should think of repealing the measure under consideration. There was another objection, namely, that by repealing the present bill, one part of the united kingdom would be placed under a different military system from the other; and the evils which might possibly result from such a consideration, were too obvious to be pointed out. On these, and other grounds, which he should not take up their lordships' time by reciting, he was induced to give the noble earl's motion a decided negative.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01224"><member>Earl Spencer</member><membercontribution> rose. He began by assuring their lordships, that he never since his first entrance into parliament rose with more real satisfaction to give his support to any motion, than that which had this night been made by his noble friend for the repeal of this act. He felt himself particularly easy in saying this, because he was certain it must be in the recollection of every noble lord who was present, when he delivered his sentiments on this bill in its passage through the house in the course Of the last session, that the arguments he had used against the bill then, had since been, every one of them, found to be verified. No bill had ever been introduced into either house of parliament with a more pompous and magnificent display of the benefits to be derived from it, and the energies it was to put in force. It was brought forward on the spur of what was said to be a most important occasion, when the country was allowed to be in the most immediate and imminent danger of an invasion, and, indeed, so much so, that a month, a day, or even an hour was not to be lost in adopting measures for the most speedy and effectual means of increasing the army of the country, and that part of it in particular, which is called the dispose able force. At that moment, his lordship said, he and other noble friends of his, with whom he acted, saw on the first fair and mature consideration of its provisions, that so far from answering the important purposes for
<col>492</col>
which it was intended, it would have the direct contrary effect, and would be infinitely more injurious to the military service of the country than those measures which were proposed for that end by his maj.'s then ministers, whom it was a principal and primary means of driving from their official situations. Seeing it clearly in that light, his ldp. said he felt it to be his duty to his country, as a lord of parliament, to give it his most decided opposition, and that too in even stage; and, he appealed to their ldps. to say, whether the reasons he had then adduced against it, but which he would not now trespass on their ldps. time by repeating, had not been since proved to be but too true? He remembered though, that one objection, which he had very pointedly urged against it was, that it went to overturn the system of the army of reserve, which had, to a certain degree, been successful, and which, therefore, their ldps. should not agree to risk losing the benefit of, unless by some mea-sure that gave at least a prospect of proving effectual, which he then insisted this bill did not. He was therefore the more surprised, when he heard what had fallen from the noble earl who spoke last, in support of this bill, which altogether over? threw the army of reserve, and all the other military measures, which had been the greatest favourites of that administration, of which the noble earl formed a part. The bill, however, had soon been found to verify all that had been said of it, and to have entirely failed in effecting an increase of the army. In the course of the first two months, without using any particular curiosity on the subject, there was not, he believed, one of their ldps. who did not know its unfortunate fate, at least in the county in which he resided; and no one person in the whole kingdom had an opportunity of knowing it more pointedly and forcibly than the right hon. gent, who was the father of it, from the astonishing deficit which took place in the very district over which he presided. He had hitherto, however, confined himself to the objection? he had to it, as a bill intended to increase the military force of the country, by raising men for its service, There were, however, much stronger arguments urged against it, and the principal of these was, that, under the pretence of raising men, it went rather to the purpose of raising money upon the country. This had been strenuously denied to be the case by
<image src="S1V0003P0I0261"/>
<col>493</col>
those who supported it; but it had actually turned out to be the fact, and now formed one of the strongest arguments that could be used in favour of the motion made by his noble friend neat him for its repeal. As a bill for raising men, no one could deny that it had totally failed of its purpose; and if it was a bill for raising money, nothing could be more clear, than that it was deserving the highest reprehension, for it was infinitely partial and unequal, and fell, with an unexampled degree of weight and severity on the landed proprietors of the country. He insisted that another noble friend near him (lord King) was perfectly right in styling it a measure of taxation, which fell not upon property equally and generally, but on the ratio of population; and the instances which that noble lord had produced, ill support and illustration of his arguments, were conclusive and unanswerable.&#x2014;His ldp. then adverted to the very defective and unjust mode resorted to by the bill of recruiting for the army in the several parishes, through the medium, and by means of parish officers. Those regular officers who were appointed to that service by the army, were generally gent, who well understood that particular duty, and, by attention and experience, were enabled to form a pretty good judgment&#x2014;which was a good man, and such as might be trusted, and which was likely to prove shy and take the first opportunity to desert, He was also personally interested in taking particular care in these respects; but the parish officer was very differently situated, and might be liable, through partiality or prejudice, to return those who were likely to desert, and thus the parishes would become doubly burdened. The noble earl who spoke second, had acknowledged that the bill had not been so successful as could be wished, and yet contended that it ought to be persisted in, because, though it had been in force nearly twelve months, it was now only just beginning to operate. As yet he had heard no arguments which could, in the smallest degree, tend to convince him that the bill ought to be persisted in. Perhaps, said his ldp. before we rise, we may hear from some noble lords, who saw this measure in a different light last year, why they have changed those opinions which they then maintained so strenuously. He confessed he could not help being curious to hear what would be their arguments in favour of the continuance of a measure
<col>494</col>
which at once overthrew all those which they had so industriously endeavoured to promote. He wished to see how the new coalition on the other side, would conform themselves on the present occasion. He had, he said, made use of that expression, which had been so often used and misused of late years, in consequence of the noble earl who spoke last having applied the word coalition to him and his noble friends who acted with him. He insisted, that any man might have differed in opinion with one or more on the first and most important of political questions, and yet might afterwards perfectly and cordially, and with the utmost degree of consistency, coincide and act with them on a question, or questions, in which they all formed the same unanimous and decided opinion, as on any point of dispute, which might arise in a subsequent period of time. It was absurd to suppose that men thus circumstanced as he had described, should, because they bad acted on contrary opinions for any length of time, never agree or net together when they might think exactly alike. Every parliamentary character was bound in questions of a public nature, to act and co-operate with those who, in his mind, were most forward in support of the interests of his country, and he should ever think himself justified in acting on that principle; but when he should be found to abandon measures which he had once supported, and to join with those who differed from him on those very measures, then he should be contented to be charged with inconsistency, and to be said to have formed a coalition, or any other term which might be chosen to designate a real dereliction of principle&#x2014;His ldp. hoped the house would pardon him for having so far indulged in this digression from the subject immediately before their ldps, to which he again reverted, and said, that he was, from every argument he had heard that night, more firmly fixed in his opinion, that the motion made by his noble friend ought to pass, and the act to which it alluded be immediately repealed. One argument urged against it was, if you repeal, this measure, you will re-enact the Army of Reserve Act, the ballot, and all those measures which have been formerly considered as detrimental to the public service. Allowing that to be the case, he would still support the motion of his noble friend; but it was not to be supposed, he
<image src="S1V0003P0I0262"/>
<col>495</col>
Said, that the matter was to rest there. Other measures would be brought forward, without doubt, and his noble friend had delayed, for a considerable time, to give notice of his present motion, or to take any steps whatever in the business, from a confidence he had in his own mind, that, as the bill was found to be so totally inefficient as that it had not answered one single purpose for which it was enacted, but had altogether failed, that therefore his maj's. ministers would be eager to seize the earliest opportunity of bringing forward either a bill to repeal it, or a bill to alter and amend it, in such a manner that the military defence of the country might receive every immediate support and improvement that time and circumstances would allow. Seeing that no such measures had been brought forward, nor intimation whatever given of an intention so to do, his noble friend felt it to be his duty to act as he had done, and he thought him entitled to the warmest thanks of the house and of the country. He knew, however, that his noble friend was willing, and he heartily concurred with him in the sentiment, to let his maj's. ministers off on as easy terms as they please. If they will promise to bring forward any measure to explain and amend the bill, or in any way to alter it so that it may become efficacious and serviceable to the country, they would be satisfied; but bethought the argument in favour of its being persisted in, because it was now only beginning to operate, was futile in the extreme, and be should, therefore, if no other more forcible one should be offered, be anxious for its being-dropped, as it could not be denied that it was a measure attended with a grievous expence, and with the most oppressive consequences to many parts of the country. He should, therefore, after thanking their ldps. for their obliging attention, conclude, by giving his vote for the motion made by his noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01225"><member>Lord Sidmouth</member><membercontribution> rose, not, he said, to gratify the curiosity of the noble lord who had just sat down; but to discharge a public duty, by delivering his sentiments on the present question. Before he should state the grounds of his opinion, he begged to repeat some of the reasons and sentiments that had been advanced by the noble Earl near him. If he had abandoned any sentiments advanced" on any public measure, then the anticipated charge of the noble earl who had just sat down might apply. But as he bad ever, regulated his public conduct by
<col>496</col>
the dictates of his conscience, and he owed it to the approving sense of conscious integrity that he always acted steadily, He begged leave to advert to the circumstance* under which this bill had been introduced into the other house. At that period a bill for suspending the operation of the Army of Reserve Act had arrived at its last stage in its progress through that house. A change of administration then took place, when the present measure was submitted to parliament, coupled with other military measures, which had been opened by his right hon. friend the then secretary of state. As to the opinion he then entertained of the efficiency of the measure, it remained still unaltered; and all that had occurred during its operation, only strengthened him in that opinion. He had been of opinion, that there was a better mode of attaining the military object which the bill professed; but if that military object could be attained by other modes, the necessity of raising the force would do away every objection. He was confident of its not being disputed, that no step ought to be taken to repeal this measure before it should be ascertained whether it would be successful or not. Here again he had no hesitation in declaring his expectation not so sanguine as that of his noble friend. He was sorry that parliament, by agreeing to the measure, had placed itself in such a situation. The bill he had originally disapproved of, and he disapproved of it still. But could it be said, that the experience of its operation was such as to warrant a conclusion that it had failed? The number proposed had not been raised; but the question now was, whether it had failed to such a degree as would justify parliament in repealing it? He was sorry parliament had agreed to that part of it which imposed an onorous penalty; but without some compulsory power there would be no efficiency. If the penalty should be incurred, and the man should be produced before it was levied, three-fourth* of the penalty would be remitted. No judgment could therefore be formed of the bill until the penalties should come to belevied. It had, last session, been deemed expedient to remit the penalties for the army of reserve. If this bill should fail, and he was not very sanguine as to its success, he was sure that the framers of the bill and parliament would not continue it by raising a heavy tax for recruiting. Measures of importance had been taken
<image src="S1V0003P0I0263"/>
<col>497</col>
for carrying the bill into effect, and much expence incurred for officers for receiving recruits. He agreed with his noble friend, that the support of this measure would come with a very ill grace from those who supported the late army of reserve act, if they had not brought forward a measure, whilst members of administration, for the suspension of that army of reserve act. A very considerable reduction had taken place in the militia under the operation of this measure. He was one of those who objected to any reduction of the militia. He was one of those who, upon constitutional grounds, thought that the militia should bear a large proportion to the regular army. But he now found there was a better reason for the reduction, the militia establishment having a deficiency of 500 officers, notwithstanding the measure that had been resorted to for allowing half-pay officers to be appointed to militia commissions. That circumstance alone pointed out the necessity of the reduction of the militia. He felt perfect relief and satisfaction at this reduction, though he wished the military to be kept up in the volunteer force of the country. He did not wish the volunteers to be kept up at the expence of the other descriptions of force; our security lay in the diversity of our military means. The volunteer force was the tribute of a free people in support of a free constitution. He did not see any grounds for the motion, until experience should prove that the bill could not succeed: but, though it should succeed to the extent of his noble friend's expectation, even then he should think it would require revision and alteration. It had been stated, early in the debate, that he had characterised it as inefficient. He had always thought the army of reserve bill a necessary measure; and when this measure was opened, the ballot was induced in its provisions, which being afterwards given up, he had stated that rigour had been abandoned for inefficiency. But it had been said, that it was not the intention of the noble earl who moved for the repeal of this act, to repeal it without proposing something more effectual in its stead. He should have been glad to hear what this something was. Was it the restoration of the ballot? That was a measure which had been universally reprobated. Was it by a draught from the militia? That also was a subject which would require consideration. Was it by service for a period to be limited? That would, not answer any good
<col>498</col>
end. By that very system had the high bounties been created, and to procure men in that way, similar temptations must again be resorted to. The present bill, however, he was happy to think, whatever it had done, it had done without interfering with the other measures which had formerly been pursued, and which he himself in a great measure had recommended. The German legion had been increased to the extent he had proposed; black corps had been established; regiments for rank had been raised. He saw nothing improper in the practice; he objected to it if pushed to the extent that it had formerly been, where persons were put out of civil life, and placed, in the course of a short time, at the head of the army. But he could see no reasonable objection to giving a military officer a step in rank, as in the present mode, and of allowing a meritorious individual an opportunity of finding men with advantage to his country, instead of paying money for a commission.&#x2014; During the time that he sat in another house, he was not unused to the charges of incapacity, inefficiency, and other illiberal epithets of the same nature, which had been with more profusion than decency applied to him, and to the measures which he bad proposed. Whatever his talents might have been, whatever portion of judgment and vigour of intellect he possessed, they had always been applied honestly and assiduously to promote the advantage and security of the country. Having nothing nearer his heart than the glory, the happiness, and the prosperity of his country, he might, perhaps, lament that he did not possess greater talents than those with which he had endeavoured to promote those great objects. But as to neglecting to provide for the defence and security of the state, that was a charge he could never acquiesce under, and which he found himself called upon peremptorily to the repel. He would refute that charge from whatever quarter it came, by referring to monumental records before parliament From those it would appear, that in 6 months after the commencement of the war, the country had 800,000 men in arms, and was in a progressive stale of discipline. There was in tins country a greater force than that in any preceding period; the regular force for the defence of Ireland was twice as great; and in the month of January, 1804, there was in the united kingdom as great a force, within 14,000 men,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0264"/>
<col>499</col>
as at any period of the late war. If the fencible regiments which had been disbanded at the peace, were excluded, the regular force oh foot, within 6 months after the commencement of hostilities, exceeded by 10,000 men that of any period during the preceding war. He thought it necessary to say so much in defence of himself. He had that night, for the first time since he had had the honour of a scat in that house, heard what he had been too much accustomed to hear in another place, but what made' little impression on him, namely of the inefficiency of his maj's. late ministers. Every thing necessary for the security of the country they had done; every measure which could conduce to ensure its safety, and uphold its honour and character, they had resorted to. He claimed no merit on that account; what he had done was only in the prosecution of his duty; be would have betrayed his trust to the public if he had acted differently; the charge of neglect and inefficiency was one which neither did or could attach to him, or to those with whom he acted, and he would, whenever it should be urged against him, repel it with all the contempt and indignation which lie felt it deserved. With respect to the bill, he was persuaded this was not the moment to repeal it, and he should therefore give his negative to the motion of the noble lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01226"><member>The Duke of Clarence,</member><membercontribution> expressed his satisfaction that the noble viscount had addressed their ldps. before him. In many of the sentiments which had been delivered by the noble viscount, he was happy to express his concurrence, as they corresponded perfectly with his own. Whatever he should say in that house, he wished to be considered as coming from a peer of parliament, for in no other respect would lie enter that house. He was extremely anxious to hear what the noble viscount had to say on this bill, a bill which had been so unequivocally condemned by many noble lords who had acted with him, and from one of whom (the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster) he had heard a most eloquent speech in exposure of it. Indeed, all the late govt. were unanimous in exposing it. He heartily coincided with the noble viscount in the encomiums he had pronounced upon that patriotic spirit which produced the volunteer force. He was himself a volunteer officer, and he would admit that a very great force had been raised. There was an obvious inconsistency in the administration; a great
<col>500</col>
part of the present had charged the last with being imbecile and incapable of carrying on the govt. Well, the govt. was changed, and what did their successors do? Why, as the consummation of all their mighty promises, they produced the present bill, which hid answered no one of the objects which it proposed to effect. With respect to the volunteer system, he was a friend to it, if it were managed as it might and should be. But, in order to derive the full advantages which that system was capable of, it must undergo much alteration. The first charge by which an impression was made against the late administration, was, that they had neglected the volunteer system. A great volunteer colonel, the present chancellor of the exchequer, had undertaken to remedy it, but his R. H. could not find that it had been much improved under his superintending care. The volunteer force, compared with what it had been, was absolutely gone by; and if the attention of govt. were not immediately directed to it, it would shortly disappear. It was, therefore, the more requisite to attend to the military part of our defence; the regular army. In order to do this properly, it would be necessary to divide it into its several integral parts, such as militia, cavalry, British and foreign, and infantry of the like descriptions. He thought he could prove to their ldps. satisfaction, that the army, thus constituted and divided, was, in all its parts, very greatly and alarmingly deficient in the numbers at which it was stated. He then adverted to the artillery, which he contended, was also defective; but not to so great a degree as the other branches of our regular army. His R. H. stated from the estimates, that the Cavalry ought to amount to 26,196 men; but, he said, they were deficient considerably upwards of 8000.; that the infantry were 865 less than during the last year, though there had not been a single shot tired in anger between them and any of the enemies of this country, from the 1st Jan. 1804 to the 1st Jan. 1805; that the deaths in the infantry since August were upwards of 2000, and the recruits only so much above that number, as to make the increase no more than 110; so that the total deficit in the infantry was not less than 86,363 men; a number which would constitute an immense army. What, he asked, could ministers say to this, and what must the country think of so alarming a deficiency, at the very mo-

<col>501</col>
ment when those ministers have brought us into a new war? A war which they, had commenced by disgracing the annals of our naval glory, and making the first efforts of our fleet "to consist of an act of piracy. They talked of a disposable force when they were conscious they bad no such thing; though they were engaged with an enemy, who possessed immense forces, and resources, from the mouth of the Elbe to Malta. If this were true, which he insisted it was, how, he asked, would it be possible, that, with such a deficiency, ministers would dare to send a single man out of the country? If they contented themselves with barely resting on their arms, without being able to attack the enemy, he contended it must prove the inevitable ruin of the country; and, as he looked on this bill to be the principal cause of this glaring and dangerous deficiency, he would certainly vote for its immediate repeal.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01227"><member>Lord Mulgrave</member><membercontribution> said, he should abstain from entering at large, or into any detail, in the observations which he meant to submit to their lordships. He had in no degree changed his sentiments since last year; he was still of the same opinion as then. He knew of but three modes of attaining a military force; 1st, by the exercise of absolute compulsion or conscription, for enforcing personal service; 2nd, by the ballot allowing a substitution for personal service; 3d, by ordinary recruiting. The first mode was unconstitutional and inconsistent with the habits, the manners, and the feelings of a free people, and therefore could not be attempted in this country. The second had been resorted to with considerable effect in the Army of Reserve Act. This was no doubt a measure of rigour, but not of idle or tyrannical rigour, for it left the party affected by the ballot, at liberty to provide a substitute by a pecuniary sacrifice. When this measure had produced all that could be expected from it, an act for suspending it in its progress passed the house, when the change took place in the administration. Another bill was then brought in for raising men and money, but on a more equitable principle. By the provisions of the Army of Reserve Act, if the individual would not serve personally, the tax fell upon him, and it was impossible to argue against the penalty, unless a compulsory power was resorted, to, to procure personal service. The present
<col>502</col>
measure was intended to obtain the men by the personal influence of the principal inhabitants, and if that influence should fail, the penalty was, and ought to fall, not on the individual, but on the persons having that influence, He knew of no measure more likely to succeed than this. His noble friend had said, that if ineffectual to its military purpose, it was objectionable on the score of its pecuniary operation. But he was one of those who thought the penalties should not be remitted under the existing circumstances, unless some other mode should be pointed out more likely to produce the men. His lordship said, after much professional experience, and after reflection on the various modes of recruiting the army, he thought that the present plan deserved a longer trial than that which had marked its origin and progress. If, however, after that fair trial which he now so earnestly solicited, it should still appear inefficient, no man would be unwise enough to persist in its continuance. As to noble lords affirming that it was a tax on the country, and that instead of men, it raised money, he could not deny but that every bill of this kind operated in some degree as a tax, although originally never intended to do so. If, as in some instances, money was paid as a legal equivalent for men, in places where' men were not easily obtained, it was, by this forced distinction called a sort of money bill, raising money by a mode which the legislature never meant, because it was well known that in this particular instance men were far more acceptable to govt. than money, as the very design of the bill was for the raising of men, and not for money. Those who attempted to poison the minds of the people by calling it a money bill, and thus to produce an odium against it throughout the country, certainly acted very unfairly, because by this false construction they endeavoured to obstruct the efforts of govt. in the public service. But he never heard of any measure, particularly that for the recruiting of the army, which could not be objected to. Every plan which had been proposed, for that purpose had been distinguished by its advocates and opponents; and he knew of no system which had ever been adopted that reconciled all difference of opinion. If some parishes or districts chose to compromise for men by the payment of money, that was no fault of those who introduced the bill, because it was
<image src="S1V0003P0I0266"/>
<col>503</col>
necessary that govt. should be supported, either in men or money; and if the latter instead of the former, then such contributions were applicable to the services of the state, by being expended for the raising of men. If the plan were bad, as some noble lords maintained, but which he denied, even then it was expedient to adopt it, till we found some better system to act upon. He therefore hoped t hat their lordships would agree with him in opinion that it ought to be continued at least till it had had a fair trial.&#x2014;The noble lord then, in allusion to some extraneous remarks on the part of noble peer, who had wandered out of his way to revive jealousies and suspicions, and to inflame party differences and temporary animosities, challenged the noble peer to produce one instance in which he could prove that either he or his colleagues in office had altered their principles. He denied any dereliction of principle whatever. There were some changes of an extraordinary nature indeed. Some of those with whom he and his colleagues had formerly the satisfaction and happiness of acting, had abandoned their principles, at least they had united with men who had uniformly avowed principles of a different nature from those that had been entertained and acted upon by them. He thought that the noble earl should have been more careful in the style which he had adopted. It was a dangerous expedient to censure others, and to sacrifice principle, for an ill-timed spleen or caprice. The noble lord said, that he had also always maintained, that the late administration was weak and inefficient, and he had no hesitation in still maintaining the same declaration. He had discharged his duty by the part which he had acted; and he was fully persuaded, that his illustrious friend, the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, had also acted upon the best and most honourable principles. These observations, he said, were extorted from him by the improper charges against himself, against his right honourable friend, and against those with whom he had the honour of co-operating for the good of the country. No men were free from faults. He and his colleagues in office had, at this time, been unfairly dealt with; they had been wantonly attacked and bitterly aspersed by those who were under the influence of wrong or mistaken motives. As there was not any argument urged against the present act which might not have been
<col>504</col>
with equal propriety advanced against any-other measure for the military defence of the country; and, as there had not been sufficient experience of the extent of the operation of the bill to authorise him conscientiously to say that it had not had the effect intended by the framers of that bill, he felt it a duty incumbent on him to support the law as it now stood, and vote against the motion of the noble lord who had opened the debate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01228"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> observed, that the contradictory language and conduct of a noble viscount (Sidmouth) and his noble friend who had just sat down, had already been most perspicuously pointed out by a noble friend of his in the course of the debate, if that were material to shew the inconsistent grounds upon which those noble lords thought proper to resist the motion before the house. But for himself, he declined to dwell upon such inconsistencies. He never was fond to argue public measures upon references to the character or motives of any individuals who might oppose or second such measures. With respect to the motives of his noble friend (Mulgrave), he had no doubt that he was satisfied of the rectitude of the motives which actuated his conduct, and so no doubt was the noble viscount (Sidmouth) also, although the ground he stated for the vote he announced his intention of giving upon this question was rather singular, and one of which he never could persuade himself to approve. He could not say with the noble viscount, that although he, always disapproved of the bill, he should still agree to let it go on, and for what purpose? Why, that if ft failed of its military object, the penalties should be enforced, which penalties, notwithstanding, the noble viscount professed to dislike. There was another reason also which the noble viscount mentioned to justify his resistance to the motion, which struck his mind to be still more singular than the former; namely, that although he considered the bill originally inefficient, and still retained the same opinion, yet that as parliament had acceded to it, it would not be respectful to parliament to repeal it so soon after its enactment, without affording it a farther trial. Now, instead of its being very respectful to parliament, to continue such a measure, so unproductive in men, and so unjust, if productive, in money, he should feel it to be quite the contrary, and a glaring mark of indifference to public security at this dan-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0267"/>
<col>505</col>
gerous crisis, to decline putting an end at once to that mischievous tampering with our military system, of which the bill under consideration formed a part. When this bill was originally introduced, it met the strongest opposition from some noble lords, who recommended a different plan, which, upon comparison, they contended to be infinitely superior. But what had become of that opinion now? How came those noble lords to shut their mouths? Why not come forward and submit their plan at present? Did the change of situation produce a change of sentiment among those noble lords? Certainly, if they thought a few months ago that the plan they supported was likely to be more productive of men than the measure to which the motion before the house referred, nothing had since occurred that could fairly account for their departure from that opinion. Their experience should rather serve to strengthen the preference they before appeared to give to their own plan. For although the bill to which they on the present occasion professed to feel so much indulgence, had had 8 months to operate, the important consequences that its authors and advocates promised, it was still confessedly unproductive. This confession the house had heard from the highest authority, and the fact to which that confession referred, the house must recollect to have been foretold by him, and several of the friends of the noble viscount, at the time the bill was proposed. They said that it would not be productive, and its advocates asserted the contrary, and very confidently too; but yet they came forward this evening with a statement that gave a direct negative to these confident assertions. They admitted that the project which was to produce several battalions, as a nursery for the regular army, had in point of fact afforded comparatively nothing; and yet when the repeal of such an act was proposed, the noble viscount said, "no, retain it." This surely was rather strange. He did not, however, mean to charge the noble viscount with a desertion of principle. He hoped the noble viscount acted upon principle, as he trusted it would not be denied that be himself did in calling for the repeal of a bill, the original passing of which he had used his utmost endeavours to prevent, upon grounds that now turned out to be completely justified. Upon the same grounds he would, on the present
<col>506</col>
occasion, press upon the good sense of the house the justice and necessity of relieving the country from this burdensome, troublesome, and odious measure. "But no," said the noble viscount, "the bill has not a fair experiment until the penalties are enforced;" and yet, added the noble viscount, I do much disapprove of such penalties. In what a dilemma, then, did the noble viscount place himself. According to his opinion, the penalties ought not to be enforced. This opinion then held out an encouragement or premium to such parishes as should not raise their quotas, and of course tended to prevent the execution of the bill. On the other hand, he observed, that if the penalties should be collected, the bill would succeed as a pecuniary, if it failed, as a military project. &#x2014;Into a comparison of the-merits of the plan said to be in the contemplation of the noble viscount and his colleagues last year, with that now under discussion, he did not think, it necessary to enter; nor if it were necessary, was he competent to it, as he was not acquainted with the entire nature of the noble viscount's plan, as stated in the other house of parliament. One part of it, which he understood to be an augmentation of our black corps, he most cordially approved of, and should thank the noble viscount for carrying it into effect&#x2014;But there was another part from which he begged leave to express his decided dissent, namely, the raising men for rank; this was a system which he would ever deprecate, and one of which ho could not speak but with the most painful sensations, because experience had convinced him of that which he felt it his duty to acknowledge, that in the share which he bore when in his majesty's councils, in advising the adoption of that measure, he acted extremely wrong. He therefore conjured his noble friend (Mulgrave), to reflect upon the nature of that experience, and not allow himself to be led away from any consideration of local interest, or the prospect of local or temporary benefit, again to have recourse to that mischievous system. Feeling as he did with respect to such a system, he could not see without serious, regret from the papers on the table, that some men had been lately raised under it. He had heard some months since, that such a thing was intended, but he had hoped that the change of ministers would have put a stop to it, particularly as his noble friend always appeared to concur
<image src="S1V0003P0I0268"/>
<col>507</col>
with him as to the consequences likely to arise, or rather inseparable from that mode of recruiting. In defending the measure under debate, he observed, that his noble friend seemed to think that he had drawn a most satisfactory conclusion in favour of this plan, because he had succeeded in exposing the efficacy of the quota bill and the army of reserve bill towards the farther supply of the regular army; but in this he conceived his noble friend to be begging the question, for he denied the bill under consideration to have any tendency to raise men. On the contrary it appeared to him to be merely a bill to raise money. He therefore objected to it, and regretted to observe the resolution of ministers to press its continuance, still more as they seemed to shew no disposition to bring forward any proposition for the efficient increase of our regular army. There was a plan to which he took occasion to allude in the course of the last session, he meant the recruiting of men for general service for a limited term. To this plan ministers did not then declare any objection, but merely required time to consider of it; of this time they had since had enough, and yet no intention was manifested on their part to bring the plan before parliament; but rather from what had been said to-night, it was clear that impediments would be thrown in its way, if it was submitted to the house; and noble lords had said, that this plan had been tried already, and found to be unsuccessfull; but he contended that it never had a fair experiment in the case alluded to. It must become the general, settled understanding among the public, that this is to be the condition of enlistment before it can have such fair opportunity of operation as to form a judgment upon it. There had been so much confusion and perplexity in consequence of the frequent and rapid succession of changes that had of late years taken place in our military system, that a great degree of jealousy, distrust, and uncertainty had prevailed among that class of men who generally entered into the army. Until that class should feel that the mode of enlistment he referred to would be established as a general principle, he did not think the efficiency of the plan could be fully and fairly judged of. Whether, or not it should become necessary in the course of the session to call for higher measures for our military defence, he hoped that a plan, recommended by so
<col>508</col>
many men of great military experience, and by the obvious principles of human nature, would be brought under consideration. Such a plan, operating in conjunction with the old and simple mode of recruiting, would, it was his firm conviction, he much more effective than all the complicated machinery introduced by the bill under discussion; a bill, the repeal of which would not, as was pretended, involve the necessity of resorting again to the Army of Reserve Act. This was a bugbear which some noble lords bad conjured up in their fancy. If this bill were repealed, surely the house would not abrogate its legislative functions; and if an additional force were found to be necessary, the house would be free to enter into the subject, and it would be hard indeed if, without much exertion of mind, it should not devise a more efficient project for raising such a force than this bill presented. The question, upon the whole, for the consideration of the house at present, he thought to be shortly this: was an additional force necessary, or was it not? If it was, this bill was useless towards obtaining it; and, if it was not necessary, to allow this bill to continue was pregnant with mischief and danger. Upon this he would rest the whole argument. With these impressions before me, said the noble lord, I have thought it unnecessary as well as improper to argue this measure on personal grounds. I have ever cautiously avoided that mode of treating any public question. It has always appeared to me the more regular, becoming mode, to argue the principle and merits of the measure without any reference to the motives, feelings, or character of the persons by whom such measure is supported or opposed. Such is the line of conduct I have pursued on this occasion. I should be sorry to say that any individuals are influenced in their public conduct by unworthy considerations, and least of all, should I say that which my thoughts would not warrant respecting the individual to whom my noble friend (Mulgrave) has particularly alluded in the course of his observations. My noble friend, feeling hurt by some personal remarks, which he conceived addressed to himself, has thought proper to make my personal conduct the subject of discussion I am accused, if I understand the accusation, of having passed a great part of my life in terms of intimate friendship, with a person of great weight,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0269"/>
<col>509</col>
and high rank (Mr. Pitt,) and having acted for many years in concurrence with him against an opposition, comprehending persons of great ability and consideration in the country. To this accusation I plead guilty. I have lived from early years in habits of the warmest friendship with the right hon. gent, alluded to, and I do not think there is any thing in the present situation of affairs that is likely, either on his part or on mine, to dissolve that friendship. This opinion is founded upon a conviction of the integrity of my right hon. friend's character and views, and that he holds a similar sentiment with respect to the character and views of any man whom he deems worthy to be his friend. I cannot suffer myself to suppose that he can entertain such an injurious and insulting opinion of his friends, that they should sacrifice their conscience, and abandon their principles, to follow any line of public conduct that lie may think proper to pursue. As to that part of my noble friend's accusation which refers to my present concurrence with persons from whom I formerly differed upon some points, which are now no more; is there any one so little acquainted with human affairs, and with the parliamentary history of this country in particular, as to suppose it a fair subject of censure, in a man to avail himself of the co-operation of any person from whom he can derive honourable support in the attainment of great and desirable public objects? If this principle required illustration, to whom should look with more confidence than to the example of the man to whom my noble friend alluded. It was the fate of that person to act in opposition for many years to several noble persons with whom, on the arrival of that crisis, the commencement of the last French war, he did not hesitate to form a coalition, and one of those noble persons retains to this hour a seat in his majesty's cabinet. Nay more, has not my right hon. friend sought to establish a co-operation in the govt. of the country with that very party, or rather that individual (Mr. Fox) upon my present Connexion with whom my noble friend has taken occasion to congratulate me this evening? When the country had been brought to the brink of ruin, by that weak, incapable, and inefficient administration, which my noble friend and my right hon. friend also so strongly and so justly reprobated, it was the wish of all good men, that an administration should
<col>510</col>
be formed, comprehending all the talent, ability, and influence which the country furnished, in order to save the stale in the great crisis that menaced it, and which, in my judgment, is still far from being removed. Upon this subject there seemed to be a perfect concurrence among all honest and independent men in parliament, and it was notoriously the expectation and desire of nine-tenths of the people. No. one more cordially embraced the, opinion than my right hon. friend, and if I am accused of an intimate connexion with the hon. person alluded to, what is to be thought of my right hon. friend, who did all in his power, we are told, to introduce the same person into his majesty's cabinet? Is it dishonourable in me to act with this hon. person on points in which we completely agree, while it is deemed honourable in my right hon. friend to have gone into his majesty's closet to advise his sovereign to appoint the same person to one of the highest offices in the state? Can it then be seriously considered inconsistent, or any thing like dishonourable in> me now to act with that illustrious person? No, impossible. Let not my noble friend indulge the idle hope that such a delusion can ever be practised upon parliament or the country. If it were practicable it is extremely impolitic, and something more, at present to attempt it. The crisis which so imperiously called for a vigorous and cordial union is not yet gone by. No man should, under such circumstances particularly, endeavour to promote discord. Rather to conciliate unanimity, than to inflame differences; rather to bury than to revive the recollection of former animosities, is at present peculiarly the duty of every honest man. What, then, should be thought of any man who would attempt to introduce the bane of discord into the councils of his majesty, in order to thwart the wishes of the country&#x2014;in order to form a cabinet upon the principle of personal exclusion? This is a principle, my lords, of which I never can approve, be cause independently of its operation to prevent parliament and the people from enjoying the administration they desired, and which it was their particular interest. to have, it tends to establish a dangerous precedent, that would afford too much opportunity for the operation of private pique against the public interest. I for one, therefore, refused to connect myself with any arrangement that should sanction that
<image src="S1V0003P0I0270"/>
<col>511</col>
principle, and in my opinion, every man who accepted any office in that administration, is, according to the letter and spirit of the constitution, responsible for its character and construction, and the principle upon which it is founded. Having said so much as to the manner in which the present administration has been formed, I again repeat, that it is my wish to treat the question before the house rather on public than personal grounds. I do not mean to condemn any man, or arraign the motives which actuate his conduct. The few observations which I have thought it necessary to submit in justification of my own conduct, I hope the house will feel, were called for by the pointed manner in which I have been alluded to in the course of the discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01229"><member>Lord Melville</member><membercontribution> said, that what he had to submit to their lordships should certainly be comprehended within a very narrow compass, for one expression of his noble friend who had lately sat down comprehended all he had to say. The noble lord spoke with great propriety when he said the military service of the country called for a-clear and decisive system of policy: that was his opinion also. It was extremely true that the exigency of the country was more than the former force of it was equal to, and this made govt. proceed on a larger scale, than they had formerly done with regard to its military strength; but he was of opinion it would be better to adhere to one system until it had been fairly tried, rather than abolish it for the sake of making an experiment upon another. We had tried a large supplemental militia, and that was attended with the most salutary consequences; but the important part of it was that of establishing a great defensive force, and then the measure was wise, upon consideration of the apprehension of invasion, and that we had no continental application for our military force; we wanted only security at home, for which purpose we had thus a powerful army, and the beneficial effects of it were felt. Next to this came the Army of Reserve Act, for which he took no merit, for he was not in his majesty's councils when it was brought forward, but without exception the Army of Reserve Act appeared to him to be one of the best means that could have been devised, and it proved the truth of the proposition, that men once introduced into military habits, either from the love of glory or
<col>512</col>
other motives, once become accustomed to military exertions might soon be brought forward to almost any extent to an unlimited service out of a limited one. Such was the effect of the army of reserve; for out of 37,000 men raised under the army of reserve, which was a. limited service, no less than 18,000 men were produced, whose services might be extended now to any part of the world. It was thought right, but he should not discuss whether right or wrong, to suspend that act, though he did not approve of that suspension. This other measure was brought forward, whether worse or better than the Army of Reserve Act, he should not discuss; but this he would say, that he would not give up this bill without having some more light before him, or without assurances of some better measure being immediately adopted in its stead. It was a bill which noble lords said, had produced no effect, although they said we had had S months experience of it. We had not in truth had three mouths experience of it, either in Scotland or Ireland. He asked their lordships, whether upon so slight a trial they would part with a bill founded on the principle of the army of reserve bill, which had been so beneficial, until experience should justify them in so doing? He apprehended they would not. The truth was, that this bill was produced when there was a great division of sentiment upon the subject in parliament, and that division necessarily pervaded different parts of the country, and from that cause the bill had been prevented from having a fair trial. Men's opinions, passions, and prejudices, had had, a great effect in thwarting the object of the bill in different places where it had been endeavoured to be carried into execution. It was said that we must have recourse to recruiting of the army instead of that system; but that had been already tried, and it was found not to answer the purpose, in point of dispatch, so well as this or some such measure; and he knew the great understanding of his noble friend better than to think-that he would forego a measure of this kind without affording it a fair trial. He therefore hoped that, instead of repealing this bill, parliament would have recourse to some alterations and improvements of it. All he asked was a fair trial of the merits of the bill. He dissuaded their lordships from too harshly adopting a system of recruiting, for it would be very
<image src="S1V0003P0I0271"/>
<col>513</col>
difficult to suppress the inconveniences that Would follow it. But there was another point on which a considerable flow of language had been employed, which might have been well enough adverted to by an argumentative speech without ornament, neither was there any necessity for the acrimony which appeared in the speech of the noble lord to whom he alluded. It would be absurd to say, that difference of political sentiment was a thing that made men unfit for each others' friendship, or that men could not be allowed to be acting for the good of their country, because they differed from others who were allowed to have that good at heart. It was one of the excellencies of our constitution, that men were naturally led to a difference of opinion in public; it was the fruit of freedom of parliamentary debate; this freedom necessarily produced divisions and acrimonious observations, and personal allusions, which generated a considerable degree of heat; but, to say that those who thus may accidentally differ, can never act together for the benefit of their country, was going much too far in his opinion. Men might, from various causes, oppose each other for a long time; might censure each other, speak of each other acrimoniously, but they might nevertheless, unite in one way of thinking, and act together; but if it should happen that those who had been from their earliest years in habits of intimacy and cordial affection, acting together in public life, should have a suspension of their friendships and predilections from an accident, he thought such a circumstance ought not to be made the subject of acrimonious observations, such as had been indulged in by a noble earl in this debate. He, on the other hand, had rather observe, that those who had long and frequently been in the habit of differing in opinion, had expressed their sentiments with considerable heat and animosity, perhaps, sometimes, towards each other, could nevertheless find a principle which called upon them to bury their animosity for ever, and to unite their efforts in the service of their country, and then treat each other with that warmth of heart and real kindness which is chiefly to be found in domestic affection, but which he did not think ought to be banished from public life. He had observed these things a little longer, as he was an older man, than most of the noble lords he-now had the honour of
<col>514</col>
addressing; he had observed that notwithstanding a good deal of apparent rancour, reconciliations of this kind sometimes, took place; if any thing of that kind could take place on this occasion, a good deal of public advantage might be derived, from this digression. It was worth while for persons distinguished in public life, to consider what the public thought of these acrimonious observations, and how easy it was to doubt the sincerity of them, and to conclude that public men were not really interested in what they said, when, they appeared to forget it so soon. These exhibitions of anger and rage on the parliamentary theatre, in which the whole public was the audience or spectators, had" not the happiest effect in producing the best opinion of those who made these exhibitions in that house. He therefore thought they might treat one another like gentlemen and cease to abuse one another. When men acted together fairly, the world never found fault with them, and gave them credit for good intentions, but parliamentary rancour was a thing the public disliked. As to warmth of debate, nothing was better; but that was not the same thing as rancour, which had always a bad effect on the spectators, who put a bad construction upon the practice of indulging it. He thus endeavoured, as well as he could, to smooth the combatants in these matters, a practice in which he had had some experience. He had only to repeat, that he should always wish every parliamentary debate to be animated, but not rancorous; that men might speak against each other with as much heat as they pleased, but still that they should treat each other like gentlemen. There should be ho such asperities and personalities between men who might expect, that from political changes or events, they would be called on to act with those very persons against whom their asperities had been directed&#x2014;a thing which might lead to their never being cordial. He was an old man, and had had much experience. He hoped noble lords would think of this principle, for they were all young enough to benefit by his advice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01230"><member>The Earl of Fife</member><membercontribution> said a few words in support of the motion, but in so low a tone of voice, that we could not distinctly hear his lordship.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01231"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> said, that even those who saw objections to the act which it was now proposed to repeal, in the first in-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0272"/>
<col>515</col>
stance, and compared it with some other system, might now with the most perfect consistency vote in favour of that which was established. He thought, therefore, that the charges on that head against his noble friend (lord Sidmouth) and others were totally groundless. The measure had been adopted by parliament, it had laid the basis of a system for the recruiting of the army, and being adopted, it ought to be persevered in, unless something manifestly much more advantageous could be substituted in its place. Nay, though it could rank only as second or third in comparison of another plan, it was better it should be retained than that uncertainty and fluctuation, on a matter so important, should prevail. Besides, the act had not had a fair trial. It had been passed amidst much heat of party. It was not till Nov. that it began to be acted upon, and even under all these disadvantages it had produced a considerable number of men, and if it went on as it had for the last two weeks, the number raised during which was 300 each, it would in a twelvemonth produce 13,000, and that without at all interfering with the other mode of recruiting. He was of opinion that our whole force was equal to the necessity of our situation, and that nothing, was wanting in it, but that the proportion of disposable force should be increased. He approved of the reduction of the militia to the old number of 40,000, on this account, that it would facilitate the enlargement of our disposable force. The army of reserve act had been of the utmost utility, by supplying, in a short time, a greater number of men than any other measure could have done. Experience, too, had shewn that the best means of speedily augmenting the general regular force was to enlist the men, first for limited service, and to this system the government ought to adhere. As to the enlisting men for a limited time, he said, that differences of opinion prevailed among the most intelligent officers. The question had been attentively and impartially weighed by ministers; and no such satisfactory reasons to rely upon its utility had appeared as to justify them in resorting to it. For his own part, he was convinced that it would not be attended with the advantages expected from it. Upon the whole, he thought that the act now in being should be continued; and he trusted, too, that the penalties it imposed for not raising the
<col>516</col>
men would be exacted; for if it were imagined that they would not, or that the bill would be altogether repealed, no exertions would be made to carry its provisions into effect. And from this cause, perhaps, it had not hitherto been so successful as it would have been, though the experience they had of it should induce the parliament to persevere in it.&#x2014;His lordship then adverted to the remarks of a more personal nature, which the allusions of the noble mover had introduced. He admitted, that in a government like this, differences of opinion must exist, and that such differences though naturally accompanied with occasional warmth or hostility, ought, not to be any bar to men concurring and acting together for the public good. The merits of such unions, however, must be decided by the circumstances under which they arose, and the motives by which they, were prompted. It was not easy to lay down any general grounds on which they could be judged. He would say, however, that if men who had long been in the habits of friendship, confidence, and concurrence in sentiment, on public affairs, and on fundamental points of the constitution, did happen to disagree, their re-union was at least as natural as their separation, and could not afford any ground of suspicion of their integrity and consistency. On the other hand, if those who had been in constant hostility and opposition to each other on all public questions, who had differed on the most essential principles of the constitution, who had opposed each other with no common acrimony in questions supposed to be connected with the very salvation of the state, did happen to form a political coalition, he confessed lie thought such a coalition would be more liable to suspicions than a re-union of those who hardly ever had thought differently, and' hardly at all on fundamental points. When he saw a union formed of those who thus had never agreed in constitutional doctrines, who had entertained such opposite sentiments on questions of peace or war, that the one had declared that peace on any reasonable or honourable terms was the policy to he adopted, and the other maintained that war was the system till a peace was obtained, which no man could have seriously believed to be, in the state of Europe which then existed, attainable; when those who had formed the coalition, too, equally disagreed in their views of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0273"/>
<col>517</col>
domestic as well as of foreign policy, the one considering as deadly attacks on the liberties of the country those precautions which the other had supported as essential to the preservation of the country&#x2014;such a coalition, he thought, marked it the object of universal astonishment, if not of indignation.&#x2014;Much had been said of widening the basis of the administration; but he confessed, that in looking at the circumstances he had just mentioned, he could not form any expectation that such an arrangement could be permanent or useful. Neither could he consider coalitions with a view to form such administrations as at all compatible with the principles of the constitution. The beauty of our government consisted in the just distribution of the power and influence of king, lords, and commons; but a confederacy of powerful men to dictate the administration, would, in effect, annihilate king, lords and commons, and constitute an aristocratic usurpation, destructive to the balance of the constitution. Such, at least, had been the sentiments once entertained of a celebrated coalition by the noble baron on the other side, and those sentiments, having learned them from him and others, he still retained. His lordship concluded by saying, that he should give his decided negative to the motion proposed by the noble earl.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01232"><member>The Earl of Buckinghamshire</member><membercontribution> said, he was free to confess that he never had expected the present measure to be very efficient, nor did he think it had turned out so; notwithstanding that opinion, he would never bring himself to vote for its repeal, until it had had a fair trial, and unless something that appeared better was proposed to be substituted in its place. He did not think this measure could ever be said to have had a fair trial, until the penalties incurred by the parishes had been actually levied. It was not that he wanted to commute for penalties the service required, nor to raise an additional tax upon that pretence, but he thought that parliament was bound to uphold the measure, by the strict enforcement of the penalties, before the effect of it could be calculated, It was not improbable that there had been a great deal of indifference and neglect, from the supposition that these penalties would not be levied. Even when the measure should have had its fair trial, and supposing it should not be found as efficient as was expected, he
<col>518</col>
would not then vote for the repeal of it, unless something else should be recommended at the same time which promised to be more efficient.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01233"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution> left the Woolsack, and took a view of the question. He compared the present act with that by which the army of reserve had been raised, and he contended, that the former followed up the spirit of the latter, moderating its operation because it was no longer necessary to apply it with so much energy. The principle of the army of reserve act was to raise men by imposing pecuniary penalties on parishes; the present bill did the same in a much less degree, because the army of reserve act had done all that could be desired from it. Indeed, a more useful measure, he was satisfied, never had obtained his concurrence; and happy he was to reflect, that all the military measures of the incapable and imbecile ministry, as it was called, had his most cordial and conscientious approbation. If the present act was repealed, it would only have the effect indeed, to repeal the only new military measure of the present cabinet, and to revive the army of reserve act, that reprobated measure of the incapable administration. He contended that the bill had not had a fair trial, for how could it be expected, that after bounties had been so high as 60l. and 701. men would all at once be found for 12l.? nor could they be found, if it was understood that the present act was to be repealed, and new measures, or the old, under which bounties had been so high, were again to be resorted to. He begged it to be understood, that he entirely concurred in thinking, that the pecuniary penalties should be inforced, if not, that would be an argument with him for repealing the act. As to other topics that had been dwelt upon that night, he thought it did not become him to say any thing. Every noble lord was the only judge of the him of conduct it appeared to him right to pursue; but still if there appeared any great inconsistency or change in the sentiments and opinions of any one member of that house, it was equally competent to any other noble lord to advert upon this inconsistency, and oppose the authority of the same noble lord, in his conduct at another time, to the authority of the opinion which he now expressed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01234"><member>Earl Darnley</member><membercontribution> made a short reply, in which he denied any intention of exciting
<image src="S1V0003P0I0274"/>
<col>519</col>
personal animosities between any noble lords, but insisted that he had an undoubted right to observe generally on the composition the govt. All coalitions on his side of the house were treated with the greatest asperity, and he thought he had at least an equal right to animadvert upon those coalitions which were made on the other side, apparently in dereliction of all principle, with no other view but dividing among them places of profit and emoluments of office. He considered it a fair and proper subject of remark, that so great a change had recently taken place in his majesty's govt. as that the leading member in the late incapable administration, had now so conspicuous a station and so great an influence in the present, and that the majority of the cabinet should now be Composed of those very men who had composed that incapable ministry, which the present minority in that cabinet had so lately contributed to overthrow. He did not think the noble lord (Melville) had any right to dictate to him or his friends. It reminded him of a celebrated dramatic performance, in which a great northern character, sir Pertinax Mac Sycophant, is perpetually giving lectures on the morality of bowing, and the virtues of political consistency. He could by no means agree with the statement of a noble lord (Hawkesbury) that 200 men a week had been raised by this bill since it began to operate. He considered the present system wholly inefficient and radically bad, and wished that the act should be expunged from the journals of parliament. The house then divided, when there appeared,

He called on gentlemen to give the subject complete consideration, to examine all the documents relative to it with the most serious attention, and not to forget that in their decision was implicated a very material branch of the commerce of the country, to which our power in general, and more particularly our naval power, was to be attributed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01241"><member>Mr. Fuller</member><membercontribution> said, that so far from the sense of the house being taken on this bill in the last session, the fact was, that the sense of not one-sixth part had been taken.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[IRISH HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01244">On the motion of sir Evan Nepean, the house resolved itself into a committee on the bill for continuing the supension of the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland. The right hon. bart. moved, that the blank left for naming the bill, be filled up with the words "six weeks after the commencement of the next session of parliament."</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01245"><member>Lord Henry Petty</member><membercontribution> rose to oppose the motion of the hon. baronet, and to move that "the first of May" be substituted. As ministers had allowed that there was no pressure of time which urged the imme-

<col>523</col>
diate passing of this bill, he confessed himself at a loss to know on what grounds they could rest their opposition to the inquiry which in his opinion was indispensable, before such a measure should be adopted. Nor was this his opinion alone; be was supported in it by the highest authorities, particularly by one of the greatest writers on the laws of this country, who asserts, that an act tending to abrogate the independence and privileges of apart of the people, without any previous examination or enquiry into the necessity for such an act, was unconstitutional. A good deal had been said about the transpiring of secrets in a committee. The right hon. gent. (Mr. Foster) had been frequently instrumental in forming such committees; he called on him to state what was the danger to be apprehended? He would not willingly anticipate a discussion that would most probably take place this session; but he must say, that he did not believe Ireland in the state represented, as so lost to all sense of the advantage of her connection with G. Britain, as to be ready to tike refuge from her, in the arms of a foreign power. If so, we should try to restore in her more favourable sentiments towards us. He particularly called on gentlemen to consider, that by voting for his amendment, they did not hazard any danger. Time would then be given to make the enquiry which was so desirable. If we should then unfortunately find that the flame of rebellion in Ireland was not extinguished, but only smothered, and that other circumstances, equally strong, required the suspension of the Habeas Corpus, we might then agree to it with the satisfaction, at least, of having done so with propriety; but if, on the contrary, we should find the situation of Ireland such as not to demand the further operation of the measure, we might then enjoy the pleasure of restoring to the Irish those liberties, which had for a time been withheld from them. At all events we should have the satisfaction of reflecting that we had not taken any hasty step; but that we had acted with the prudence and circumspection which the importance of the case required.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01246"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> felt himself obliged to support the original motion. The merits of the question lay in a very narrow compass. All that could be stated in objection to it, had been stated in the ablest manner possible by the noble lord.
<col>524</col>
Want of time had never been alleged by his majesty's govt. as the cause for passing this bill without inquiry, but that they felt, what parliament in eight instances put of eleven, since the year 1798, had likewise shewn they felt, that evident notoriety superseded all necessity for inquiry. Since that year, only three cases had occurred out of eleven, in which it was deemed expedient to institute committees of inquiry. He would not go over the same ground again which had so frequently been trodden. Gentlemen did not deny that there might be cases in which notoriety would be considered as sufficient ground for the suspension. The hon. baronet opposite (sir J. Newport) had stated that to be his opinion; and as for the right hon. gent. near him (Mr. Windham), it was unnecessary to ask him to state his opinion; his conduct when he had the pleasure of acting with him, was a sufficient proof of that opinion. If the existence of a war with France, if the designs avowed by that power to invade Ireland, if the evident preparations of extensive means for that purpose, if the hopes of success entertained by the enemy are founded on the prospect of co-operation by the disaffected in Ireland, if, as a proof that such are their expectations, regiments of refugees have been formed, and bands of Irish interpreters, guides, &amp;c. collected, all acting under the inspection of an Irish committee at Paris; if all these circumstances did not constitute notoriety, he really did not know what would. The going into an inquiry would lay open secrets that it was material should not be disclosed; as the disclosure would be attended with danger to the lives of individuals. On these grounds he could not consent to the formation of a precedent for instituting an inquiry, when the notoriety was such as to preclude all necessity for it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01247"><member>Mr. C. Wynne</member><membercontribution> said, he was willing to allow that there had been many cases in which the notoriety was sufficient, without any particular investigation of the circumstances; such, for instance, as the rebellions in 1715, and 1745, when the king sent down a message to the house, which was considered a sufficient ground. In 1803, likewise, when the rebellion in. Ireland was notorious. It was the duty of parliament, before they agreed to so extraordinary a measure, to make strict inquiry, unless they had very strong grounds indeed, such as he had just mentioned.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0277"/>
<col>525</col>
He did not wish to see unconstitutional power placed in any hands, however small the chance of its being abused. During the administrations of Lord Somers, Lord Coke, and Lord Raymond, a person had been imprisoned 40 years by government in Newgate.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01248"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> observed, that that person had been confined by different special acts of parliament, and not by a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, which did not at that time take place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01249"><member>Mr. Windham</member><membercontribution> conceived the amendment of the noble lord not to have been clearly understood, as the objection he made was not perhaps at all, but certainly not so much to the measure itself, as to its being adopted without a previous parliamentary enquiry. The right hon. chancellor of the exchequer had done him the honour to state Ins conduct on a former occasion, when he certainly adopted the measure upon public notoriety, because the danger was present, and staring them in the face; but the right hon. gent. must recollect, that even then he expressed his opinion that an enquiry should first be instituted, but that he was overruled by that right hon. gent. himself, and others, on the ground that the danger was both pressing and notorious. But on no occasion did he say, that this suspension should continue always; for when he supported it on the spur of the moment, his support was founded both upon necessity and notoriety. He had now no ground or information before him, to shew that this measure was bottomed either in one or the other. He now wanted the notoriety, and had reason to think and believe, that since the passing of the act now in force, a great change had taken place in the minds and dispositions of the people of Ireland. Here there was no information brought forward, no danger was made apparent, no necessity shewn, no notoriety established, and yet the house was called upon to pass this act of suspension of the liberties of the people of Ireland, as it were by acclamation, and with no more than twenty-four hours notice. He admitted, as was done by the noble lord who moved the amendment, that the measure might be necessary, but there was no proof of it. There was some reason for it in the former instance; he thought there was reason for it; but the ministers did not think proper to give them they now. If it should be admitted that the enemy having Irish officers, and Irish general, should be a justification of sus-
<col>526</col>
pending the liberties of the people of Ireland, there never was, nor ever would be a time of war when the same argument would not equally prevail. He defied any one to mention the war in which, all these circumstances did not uniformly happen. Considering the temper of the people of Ireland, he thought that even decorum towards them required that an investigation should take place into the necessity of the measure. If this precipitation should be understood by them, as proceeding from inattention and indifference, it might be productive of the most fatal effects. For all these and other reasons, with which he should not detain the house at present, he should vote for the amendment proposed by the noble lord. An inquiry could not do any harm, it might do much good; and it would at least do this good, that it would prevent the establishment of a precedent in the highest degree exceptionable, and which might ultimately produce the most fatal consequences.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01250"><member>Mr. Martin (of Galway)</member><membercontribution> said, he should, for one, certainly agree to the noble lord's amendment. If notoriety were sufficient to warrant the suspension, without inquiry, he should say, that notoriety did not exist. He had conversed lately with many gentlemen from Ireland, who concurred in opinion that the measure was not necessary to secure the peace of the country. It had been, indeed, spoken of, as not likely to do harm; but such an infringement of the liberties of a people ought to be proved to be attended with positive good, before it should be adopted. A bill of this description was not to be treated as lightly as a vote of credit. With regard to the secrecy so much contended for, and the danger and inconvenience said to attend enquiry, was there not considerable danger and inconvenience in exposing the affairs of the Bank of England, and yet a committee had been some time ago appointed to investigate and make a report on that subject. Why should the people of Ireland be treated with less ceremony? As to the character of the lord lieutenant and his secretary, it made no legislative ground for so severe a measure as the present. He never knew a lord lieutenant in that country who was not represented as a very amiable man. He never heard of a secretary who was not said to be possessed of the highest talents, and overflowing with humanity and benevolence. But these accounts, coming from a certain description of persons, were not always to be de-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0278"/>
<col>527</col>
pended upon. The flattery towards men in power was carried to such excess, that he could recollect gentlemen having seriously asserted, and mentioned in public companies, that lord Hobart was a much more eloquent man than Mr. Flood had ever been! These panegyrics were easily obtained, but he thought the people of Ireland would indeed be very hardly dealt with, if they had no other security for their liberties than the character of those who may happen to be in power.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01251"><member>Mr. Robert Ward</member><membercontribution> commented on the arguments made use of by a right hon. gent. (Mr. Windham), at some length, and contrasted them with the sentiments he had expressed on some former occasions, when a measure similar to the present was proposed to the House of Commons. Lord Folkstone here called the hon. and learned gent. to order, on the ground of his allusions being irregular. After some conversation, the hon. member proceeded to observe, that the arguments against the suspension of the Habeas Corpus, drawn from the deficiency of glaring instances, as stated by some hon. members, might be met by an illustration of an opposition of the same nature, which illustration was made by a right hon. gent. a few years back (Mr. Windham) who mentioned the case of the captain of a ship who went on a voyage round the world, and had provided himself with certain ventilators, and other machines of a useful description. "I laid out my money," said the captain, "for nothing, for I have not had a sick man during the whole of my voyage." The hon. gent. then alluded to the miseries which Ireland had suffered, and which had left her in a state of trouble; miseries which could not have been overcome, but by that system of vigour which had been adopted by administration. With respect to the measure now opposed by the hon. gentlemen on the other side, he should not wish to go farther back than the period of the revolution, to shew the manner in which such suspensions had been proposed and received in that house. In the first year of King William III. the deliverer of this country from tyranny, the Habeas Corpus was suspended, without any particular case, or any previous examination before parliament. A message was sent down from the throne, and it was stated, that his majesty's government found it necessary to arrest some suspected persons, but that they were met in their way by the
<col>528</col>
Habeas Corpus Act. The king's word was taken for granted, and the motion passed. In 1707, and 1715, it was also suspended without any examination. In 1722, no case was made out; it was stated in the speech from the throne, that a dangerous conspiracy existed in the country; this was answered by parliament by an address, and the bill of suspension passed the next day. The result of all the precedents was, that it was not usual to establish the facts by evidence before the house of commons. It was only necessary, that the house should have a general belief as to their existence. Could any man open his eyes, and not perceive that the measure was necessary? As to the duration of time proposed by the noble lord, he should oppose it, because, if the suspension was only to continue six weeks, it might as well not take place at all. He expected no advantage from the measure, unless considered as a permanent one.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01252"><member>Sir John Newport</member><membercontribution> observed, that in every instance adduced by the hon. and learned gent. there was either inquiry, or something equivalent to it; there was some message from the king, or some communication in the speech from the throne. Now there was nothing relative to this subject in the speech from the throne, and the speech on the address, which was generally supposed to be the production of his majesty's ministers, stated Ireland to be tranquil. How then could it be said, after so short a lapse of time, that there was so notorious a spirit of rebellion as to preclude inquiry? The Habeas Corpus Act having been restored since the rebellion of 1798, he considered it now as suspended <i>de novo,</i> and that the consideration was a <i>res integra;</i> unless, indeed, it was meant to rely on the affair of 1803, which he was at a loss how to name; the gentlemen on the other side styling it at one time a rebellion, at another time a tumult or insurrection, or a contemptible riot, as it answered their purpose. If the suspension was to be renewed every year without inquiry, it was better to extend it at once to six weeks after the termination of the war. Parliament would not do its duty to the country, if it refused inquiry, and rendered the constitution a mere nullity to the people of Ireland on such light grounds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01253"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> said, that he did net rise for the purpose of now entering into the merits of this question, but to beg the hon. and
<image src="S1V0003P0I0279"/>
<col>529</col>
learned gentleman (Mr. Ward), who dwelt so much upon historical precedents, to reconsider whether he was justified in the assertion, that no parliamentary inquiry took place on the subject of the conspiracy in 1722.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01254"><member>Mr. Macnaghten</member><membercontribution> said, that the dangers of Ireland had not been mentioned in the speech from the throne, on account of the notoriety of the case, and that the object was to prevent the recurrence of the horrors of 1798 and 1803. If this act had been in force in 1803, lord Kilwarden would not have been murdered. Certainly the loyal subjects had increased in Ireland, but that, he said, was no reason why they should be taken less care of now than formerly; but who was prepared to say, that there were, no jacobins there, ready to help the cause of France? He cautioned the house against the opinions of such as would make such a desperate assertion. The jacobins who destroyed the French monarchy were not very numerous, nor were they in Dublin when they murdered the lord chief justice, and many others of his majesty's subjects. They might still do great mischief, if that house did not pass this bill, which the loyalists of Ireland expected. It was a serious measure, but the loyal part of the people were not safe without it. He saw no necessity for an enquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01255"><member>Mr. Bagwell</member><membercontribution> argued in favour of the bill, from the notoriety of the necessity, especially in his part of the country, where a gentleman could not let a farm to anew tenant without the chance of his being exposed to death, or some severe calamity. Numerous atrocities were committed, yet people dare not come forward to detect and punish the perpetrators. It was a melancholy consideration, that it became necessary to put a number of persons out of the pale of the constitution; but the only question was, whether it should be the loyal or the disloyal part of the nation?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01256"><member>Lord De Blaquiere</member><membercontribution> supported the suspension. He said if me notoriety was denied, the country was lost; he did not see how we could get on. He complimented the talents of the noble lord who moved the amendment, and praised his parliamentary management, in avoiding the meeting it on its original grounds. He said that inquiry would defeat the object of the measure. Make out such a case as gentlemen on the other side, desire, and you defeat the object of the bill. Tell a rogue you know his tricks and his haunts, and it is
<col>530</col>
more than possible he may withdraw himself from your reach. The noble lord referred to the resolution of the high sheriff and gentlemen of Waterford to apply to the lord lieutenant, not only f r a suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, but also for the establishment of military and free quarters, in case further outrages were committed. The enquiry proposed could not be had without witnesses, or, as they were called in Ireland, approvers. Every one knew that for the last ten years many such persons had been assassinated; half the people executed within that period had been condemned for assassination. He recollected a witness, who underwent a private examination in Dublin, and proved several circumstances of treason against different persons. It was thought necessary to send him and his wife to Liverpool till the trials came on. The man's name was Henley, lie was followed to Liverpool, and from thence to London. The very night he came into London, he was murdered at the end of Piccadilly. Let gentlemen look to the speeches made in the Conservative Senate at Paris on the 4th of this month. See what say M. Talleyrand and St. Jean d'Angely, and see what statements they, boastfully made of the present situation of Ireland, and what they called its oppressions and the refusal of liberty of conscience, and the expectation they entertained of being joined, in case of a descent, by the people of that country, who had likewise their notions heated by the proposed agitation of the Catholic question. Hon gentlemen seemed, little inclined to consider whatever came from the side of the house on which he sat; but, perhaps, they might not be indisposed to attend a little better to what came from that authority. His lordship relied upon the spirit and fortitude of the man who now conducted the business of the empire, that he would not bend before, any opposition offered that night, nor swerve from his purpose of doing his duty to the public.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01257"><member>Mr. Kinnaird</member><membercontribution> felt it impossible to sit silent and hear the intentions of his noble friend who moved the amendment, misrepresented as they had been. He refuted the charge of parliamentary management conveyed in the shape of a compliment. The intention of his noble friend was not to refuse what govt. had asked, but only to procure good and sufficient reasons for its necessity. It was rather an extraordi-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0280"/>
<col>531</col>
nary argument for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland, that a man was murdered at the end of Piccadilly. He could not see that offences committed under the suspension were good reasons for a continuance of that suspension. The gentlemen who had spoken on the other side had declined to meet the question fairly, which was, whether, granting the suspension, it was not prudent to examine the reasons afterwards?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01258"><member>Lord De Blaquiere</member><membercontribution> did not consider it as any reproach upon the noble lord to compliment him for his parliamentary management.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01259"><member>Dr. Duigenan</member><membercontribution> said, the hon. gent. had mistaken the object of the noble lord's story, which was to shew, that Irish witnesses could not come with safety to London to give information before a committee. Assassinations similar to this were very common in Ireland. The suspension of the Habeas Corpus could not prevent such outrages; but it certainly rendered them less frequent. He had resided in Ireland from his youth, and he must of course know its situation better than the hon. gent. opposite; he took leave to say also, that he had a little more regard for it. The county of Waterford was notoriously disturbed, as was evident from the resolutions of the magistrates at a county meeting, at which the sheriff, a respectable member of that house, presided. An adjoining county also (Tipperary), the representative of which was present, was in servants a state, that the houses of all loyal men which had not a number of servants, or a large family to defend them, were broken open and robbed of their arms, and these arms were certainly not intended for shooting snipes. The county of Carlow was the scene of nocturnal meetings, and so was the county of Limerick, the representative of which was also present. The city of Dublin itself was under the necessity of being patrolled every night from the multitude of dangerous conspiracies and assassination plots; centinels were shot dead and maimed on their stands, and it was known that even committees were formed for systematising assassination. On all these grounds he thought the suspension indispensably necessary. We might truly say, <i>incedimus perignes suppositos cineri doloso.</i></membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01260"><member>Mr. May</member><membercontribution> declared his conviction of the general Royalty of the North of Ireland; but in the South and West disaffection certainly existed. The suspension was necessa-
<col>532</col>
ry to satisfy the loyal, who, without this security could not sleep in their beds. It was necessary to keep down the majority of the people of Ireland, consisting of Catholics, dangerously agitated and inspired by the confidence of French aid, with the hope of effecting a change in the establishment in their own favour. He was informed besides, that a strong measure was to be proposed from the other side of the house, to put the Catholics on a state of perfect equality with the protestants; and if it did not pass this house, the suspension of the Habeas Corpus act would be necessary to prevent them from breaking out into violent outrages.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01261"><member>Lord Temple</member><membercontribution> said he had one word to offer in answer to the hon. gent. who had spoke last but one, and a little to the last, both of whom had pronounced a libel on the majority of the people of Ireland, a libel which, came particularly ill from the mouth of any one connected with that country. He protested against the principles they maintained, and against the libel they had thrown out. He protested also against the doctrine, that because he and his hon. friends did not represent Ireland, they could hot feel for that country as warmly as the hon. gent. (Dr. Duigenan). This was a charge of deficiency not only in the duty they owed to all the Empire, but a direct charge that they did not pay the same attention to particular parts of it which was given by the persons representing these parts. He was sure it was not so, and he was happy the hon. gent. was not supported in his insinuations by his brethren on that side of the house. If he and his hon. friends had not a right to interfere in the concerns of Ireland, the hon. gent. must allow the principle a reciprocal force. He would here call to the recollection of the hon. gent. the instance of the Additional Force bill of the last session, which was enacted for England, contrary to the sense of the majority of the English members, and on which the representatives of Ireland, and he believed among them the hon. gent. had claimed and exercised a full right of giving their votes. This by the bye. Now for the hon. gent.'s arguments. The hon. gent. in answer to the alledged want of notoriety, cited a list of atrocities which appeared to astonish those in favour of the measure, as much as those who opposed it. It would be as well, when the hon. gent. should again be disposed to indulge the house with the recital of such a catalogue, if he would
<image src="S1V0003P0I0281"/>
<col>533</col>
take the opportunity of telling us why, at the time the mover of the address, in answer to his majesty's speech, gave a flourishing representation of the tranquillity of Ireland, he did not stop him, and set him right, and prevent the house from carrying a false statement to the foot of the throne. If the hon. gent. was so full to the mouth with outrages and enormities, he should not have sat silent on an occasion like that, and now for the first time, astonish the house with the production of this bead roll of iniquities. If half what the hon. gent. had stated, was true, his majesty's ministers were most negligent in suffering his majesty to take leave of his parliament at the close of the last session, or to meet it at the commencement of this, without saying one word on the subject; and in allowing the parliament to go to the throne, with an address so little apposite. If no evidence could be had, at least a message from his majesty might have laid a parliamentary ground for the discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01262"><member>Mr. May</member><membercontribution> in explanation said, he allowed the loyalty of the north, but disaffection existed in the south. The lower class of the people were ready to rise at any time the appearance of a French force presented the opportunity, and it was necessary to keep them down with a strong hand; he did not mean to asperse the catholic gentlemen, who were good, loyal, and faithful subjects, but a low multitude, headed by as low and ill educated a clergy.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01263"><member>Dr. Duigenan</member><membercontribution> said, he had not denied the right of the English gentlemen to interfere in the concerns of Ireland; he had said no such thing. He only contended, that he was better acquainted with the state of Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01264"><member>Lord Temple</member><membercontribution> said, that was the obvious deduction from the hon. gent.'s arguments, lie did not wish to give the house so bad an entertainment as a discussion between two gentlemen, as to the fact in what had so recently occurred; but he believed he was in the recollection of the house, when he described the hon. gent. as representing that the English members had not the same regard for Ireland that he had. If he was wrong, the house would correct him; and he was the more particular as to the expression, as he would draw this line of distinction upon it, that if all members, from all parts of the empire, had not the same regard for every part, they were not fit to sit together.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01265"><member>Mr. Hutchinson</member><membercontribution> lamented that the li-
<col>534</col>
berty of speech, which was the first privilege of the house, had been so much abused and degraded by the utterance of things which every man ought to lament having heard. The mover of the bill must certainly know that the non-renewal of the suspension would have been less mischievous than the language which had been uttered this night. Never was any language more unfounded or unjustifiable, or more inconsistent with a sincere wish for the integrity and unanimity of the empire, which representation could not fail to embitter the minds of a people agitated and divided in consequence of the bad system by which they had been governed for centuries. He voted for the original motion. But he was of opinion that the union would be of little benefit, if it was not followed up with other marks of attention to Ireland than continued suspensions of the Habeas Corpus Act.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01266"><member>Lord H. Petty</member><membercontribution> begged leave to set himself right from some misunderstandings. He did not say, that notoriety was no ground, but that it should be accompanied with great and imminent danger. Notoriety was too general and vague a term to be in itself sufficient; and if ever there was a doubt how indecisive this term was, the various meanings that had been affixed to it this night afforded the strongest exemplification of it. The representations of Ireland by the gentlemen of that country were completely at variance. It was evident from this, how dangerous it was for parliament to lend itself to mere representations; and, for himself, when the evidence was doubtful, he preferred that which went to maintain the people in the enjoyment of their liberties to that which went to deprive them of them.&#x2014;The question being now put, there appeared,

These were severally read a first time.&#x2014;A message was brought up from the Commons, importing that the house had granted leave to two of its members, the hon. G. L.

<title>[CONDUCT OF JUDGE FOX.]&#x2014;</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01268"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> said, he had to call the attention of their lordships to a subject of very serious and weighty importance, namely, the matters alleged in charge against one of his majesty's judges in Ireland, Mr. Justice Fox, now under their lordships' consideration. He certainly should have come forward, as he now intended to do, when the subject was last under discussion, were he not prevented from attending by severe indisposition. The case was certainly of a novel description in that house, and, in every point. of view, whether as effecting the individual, the public, the character of that house, and the consideration of its being to form a precedent with respect to the exercise of the highest of all their functions, one of the greatest importance, and it behoved them lo proceed to its consideration in the most serious and deliberate manner. On this head, lie felt it his duty to submit to their lordships his ideas of what was proper and fitting to be done upon the occasion. He did not know that he should have to close what he had to say with, any regular motion. What he should offer, he had ra-
<col>536</col>
ther their lordships would turn in theft minds, did they deem it of any weight, or receive assistance in the way of discussion from those who were more conversant in the subject than himself, either then, or any future opportunity, than come to any decision upon his propositions, that day. As the case stood, it appeared that several petitions were presented last session, complaining of misconduct on the part of one of the Irish judges in the execution of his high official duty; in considering this proceeding, it was natural to refer to the provisions of those acts of parliament, by which the judges were placed in their present situation. By these the tenor of their offices was good behaviour, they were re-moveable only on the address of both houses of parliament; the case might some before them in the way of judicial proceedings. With the House of Commons there were two options vested: the first to vote an address of removal, in which their lordships would afterwards have to consider of their concurrence; or to impeach the party before the tribunal of that house. In deciding upon the case, as it then stood before their lordships, they should be guided by two leading considerations: first, that of proceeding in the most convenient manner under the circumstances of the case; and, secondly, that such proceeding should be in a way the most analogous to the principles of the constitution. With respect to the first, it would be proper to pause, for a time sufficient to ascertain whether the other house of parliament may not originate a proceeding upon the case, as it may in point of fact? In a case like the present, where the charge was one of positive misconduct, it would be more regular, as well as. more consonant to the former practice, and more conducive to the ends of public justice, to make the application, in the first instance, to the other house, who, as he said before, were invested with the twofold option of proceeding, either by the way of address or impeachment. With respect lo this, it was seriously incumbent upon their lordships to consider of the contingent possibility of the case ultimately coming before them in their judicial capacity, in the shape of an impeachment; in such a case they would have to sit as a court of justice upon that which, in the way now proposed, they should have tried by previous examination; the consequences of this were too obvious to expatiate
<image src="S1V0003P0I0283"/>
<col>537</col>
upon. In that view of the question, particularly, it would be preferable to let the application, in the first instance, be made to that branch of the legislature which, constitutionally, forms the grand inquest of the nation. By proceeding in the line at present chalked out, the ordinary situation of the two houses would, most probably, be inverted; as, possibly, they may be so placed as to appear, to a certain degree, as prosecutors before the house of commons. In this view of the question, he thought there could be little difference of opinion. He was decidedly of opinion it was preferable to let the matter originate with the other house. It would be for the house to consider, whether or not, in the mode proposed, a degree of wrong might not be offered, either to the interests of the parties, those of justice, or to the rules prescribed by the constitution. In pursuing the course he recommended, they did not in the least renounce those powers which the acts of parliament vested in them. He again pressed the general importance of the subject to their lordships' minds; and these considerations attending upon the case being entirely new, on this ground, he rather wished the house would come to no decision that night, but take time to consider the case in all its views and bearings. In this view, and with reference to what he had said of the probability of the other house taking it up, he thought it would be proper to adjourn the. sitting of the committee, which stood for to-morrow, for six weeks or two months, or rather, that no particular time should be fixed for its sitting; this to be done so as that the parties might understand that the. delay was for no other purpose than to afford them an opportunity of addressing, themselves to the other house of parliament; this delay, in fact, would not operate as an impediment to, nor a denial of justice; for, at the expiration of the period, the parties would have just the same opportunity of redress with that house as at present; however, in order to give effect to what he had laid down, and to give their lordships time to consider what he had suggested, he should take the liberty of moving, that the order for the committee sitting to-morrow be discharged, and a similar order made for Thursday.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01269"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> said, he differed widely in opinion from the noble baron, in what he had advanced upon the subject,
<col>538</col>
in every point of view, either with reference to the individual concerned, the interests of the administration of justice in Ireland, or to the public at large. He thought the investigation should be proceeded with in the way already agreed upon, and with as little delay as the circumstances of the case would admit. Their lordships would, have to consider the situation in which the ease stood before them. It had been brought forward by a noble member of that house towards the close of the last session. After some discussion, it was adjourned to the present session, when there arose some doubts as to the proper course to be taken the result of their lordships' deliberations on that point was, that it was desirable, before Mr. Justice Fox should be called upon to answer the matters alleged, that some enquiry should, be made into the case, and some <i>prima facie</i> evidence offered, with a view to establish a ground for subsequent proceeding. A farther delay was then acceded to, in order to afford; time to enable witnesses to come from Ireland. That last interval of delay being elapsed, he was surprised to hear on this day, for the first time, new doubts thrown out as to the propriety of what had been done, and a considerable further delay pressed for. Upon the whole, he was decidedly of opinion, the most regular and expedient way would be, to proceed, in the line already resolved on. With respect to the constitutional consideration of the case, he saw no objection whatever against the matter as given in that house. He, was aware of the respective legal right of either house to originate things of the, kind; yet there were considerations which, more properly, and, with a view to general practice and usage, more particularly fell within the province of the one house than of the other. Matters of commerce, revenue, and finance, lay more particularly with the Commons. On the other hand, there were several matters which, by the same rule, it lay with their lordships to originate. Such, particularly, were cases of divorce bills; certain considerations with respect to the law, in deciding upon which, they could have the assistance of the learned judges, who occasionally attended for the purpose; and also that of the heads of some of the courts of justice, who were usually members of that house. He was convinced, the ends of justice would be more satisfactorily answered, by suffering the business to
<image src="S1V0003P0I0284"/>
<col>539</col>
proceed in its present course; not only in this, but in point of expedition, it was infinitely preferable. In any mode of proceeding, the concurrence, or the co-operation of that house would be eventually necessary. As the case stood, the mode recommended by the noble lord would be only productive of further and even injurious delay. The commons could adopt no middle course between a vote of their house, either for redress or impeachment; in the pending interval the character of the individual would remain at stake, and in some degree the administration of justice in Ireland suspended, for, by their single vote, the judicial functions of the individual would not be entirely taken away. Upon the whole, though he differed entirely from the noble baron in his proposition, yet he was not adverse to deferring the farther consideration of the case for a very short time, in order to afford their lordships an opportunity of turning over in their minds what had been respectively thrown out. His mind, however, upon the point was made up; and he should have seriously to recommend to the house to proceed in the course already resolved upon, and with as little farther delay as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01270"><member>The Earl of Carlisle</member><membercontribution> made a few observations in support of what had fallen from his noble friend. He pressed the consideration, that their lordships, in the mode proposed, would have to proceed as a grand jury, in an <i>exparte</i> way, and upon a case which possibly might afterwards Come before them as judges; and he contended, that, on the score of expedition, the line of conduct recommended by his noble friend was by far the most preferable.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01271"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution> quitted the woolsack, and directed his observations chiefly to the situation in which the question stood and the most eligible mode of proceeding In point of form; he declined delivering his sentiments upon the subject till a future opportunity, but he seemed to prefer proceeding with the investigation, as the house had already determined. There was one point which had transpired in the course of that evening's discussion which he was happy to observe, and for which he had to express his thanks to noble lords; nay, even his gratitude; namely, the apparent disposition to act upon the opportunities which the constitution afforded them, of having recourse to the assistance, when necessary, of the law lords, and to render their attendance effectual.</membercontribution></p>
<col>540</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01272"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> spoke in explanation, and expressed his astonishment at the way in which the noble secretary of state seemed to consider what had fallen from him. He thought his conduct, on the occasion, required no apology; it was the bounden duty of every member of that house to come forward and otter his opinion, in every stage of a business, and on every opportunity, as to what he thought might' best favour the ends of public justice. He was prevented by indisposition from attending when the subject was last discussed. No considerations of delay or inconvenience should militate against the paramount principles and more important ends of public justice. They should consider the novelty of the case before them, and that they were about to set a precedent to future ages, on a point of the last importance in the exercise of all their functions.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01273"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> explained. As far as his recollection served him, he had said nothing which ought to induce astonishment on the part of the noble baron; he regretted the cause of his inability to attend when the subject was last discussed; but a considerable interval had since elapsed, in which the noble lord had an opportunity of coming forward. He had so far conceded as to agree to the noble lord's proposition in the first instance, but he had to deprecate all unnecessary delays in the investigation of the case.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01274"><member>The Duke of Clarence</member><membercontribution> expressed his satisfaction at what had fallen from the noble lord who had opened the discussion; but not having attended the former discussion upon the subject, he confessed himself rather at a loss to know the precise situation in which the case then stood, and begged any noble and learned lord present would inform him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01275"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution> quitted the woolsack, and explained generally to his R. H, that the object of the committee, which had been ordered to sit, was to investigate the truth of matters alleged, so far as to ascertain whether a sufficient ground appeared to warrant their lordships in calling upon the accused to answer, or to entertain a motion for an address upon the occasion. The witnesses were to be examined upon oath before the committee, as to the truth of matters alleged, but to what extent it was for the committee to determine.&#x2014;The question was then put upon Lord Grenville's motion, which was accordingly ordered,</membercontribution></p>

<title>[IRISH HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION BILL.]&#x2014;</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01276"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> called to the recollection of their lordships what had fallen from him on a former evening, relative to the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland, and the great discretionary power vested in the crown in consequence. It being in agitation to renew the measure, as one of very questionable importance, he thought that adequate reasons should be assigned for it. With that view, he called for the information which was stated in his motion on a former night. He expressed his hope that the noble secretary of state had, upon further consideration, altered his opinion upon the point, and would agree to the production of the information required. His lordship then proposed his motion, similar lo that offered on a former night; the leading point was, "that an account of the conditions on which such persons as were liberated from confinement under the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act, were discharged, be laid before the house."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01277"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> replied, that the more he had considered the point, the more confirmed he was in his objections to such a proceeding. The noble secretary then repeated his observations on the former occasion, as to the dangerous tendency, in various points of view, of making the disclosure required; this, he thought, so obviously the case, that he did not wish to take up their lordships' time in further descanting upon the subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01278"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> could not see any objection to that part of the motion; he thought the condition upon which these persons were discharged was a piece of information which it was necessary, should be laid before parliament, in order that they might see how the powers given by former suspension acts had been used, particularly when they should probably be shortly called upon to renew that suspension. He could not conceive that any mischief could arise from the disclosure of secret information mentioned by the noble secretary of state, as the conditions of their discharge must be known to the persons liberated, and if this part of the motion was refused it would follow that information was granted to those persons who had probably been arrested upon suspicion of treason, which was denied to parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01279"><member>The Marquis of Sligo</member><membercontribution> declared his entire opposition to that part of the motion,
<col>542</col>
as local circumstances rendered it highly inexpedient that such information should be disclosed.&#x2014;After a few words from Lord King, that part of his lordship's motion in question was withdrawn.&#x2014;Adjourned to Monday.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[THE BUDGET.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01281">The house having resolved itself into a committee of the whole house, to consider further of ways and means for raising the supply granted to his majesty, and the several accounts which had been presented to the house being referred to the said committee,</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01282"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> rose and addressed the committee as follows: Mr. Alexander; the first article of supply that has been voted, to which I shall call the attention of the committee, is the supply for the naval service. The total amount of what has been already voted, exclusive of the sum of 390,000l for ordnance sea service, is 14,645,630l. exceeding by 2,600,000l. the amount of what was voted last year for the same service. The excess has arisen from the sum of 1,800,000l. for the expences attending the 20,000 additional seamen voted this year, and for the increase in the extraordinaries and transport service. The next article of supply is the army; there has been already voted under this head, the sum of 10,000,000l. for guards, garrison, militia, &amp; c. I will not detain the committee by going over the different items, but there remain still two articles to be voted, the estimate of the extraordinaries, and of the expences of the volunteer corps; in the latter article there may be some small diminution, but I will take the amount at 1,100,000l. The extraordinaries I calculate to amount to the same as last year, 3,660,000l. These two items, added to the total of ten millions, make an aggregate sum, exclusively of the expence under the same head for Ireland, of 14,778,391l. which is an exceeding beyond tile last year of about 300,100l. For Ireland, under the head of army, there has been already voted the sum of 2,838,000l. To these remain to be voted the sum of 300,000l. and the same sum for the expence of volunteer corps, making the whole amount for Ireland 3,838,506l. The total amount of the votes for the army, therefore, for both countries will be
<col>544</col>
18,6l6,89l. The total amount under the same head of service for last year, was 19,143,000l. The next service is the ordnance; the amount for England is 4,246,994l.; for Ireland 600,000l. making a total of 4,846,004l. Under the head of miscellaneous services, there has been al already voted for England the sum of 611,000l. but some further sums remain to be voted, which will make the total for England 800,000l. The miscellaneous services for Ireland, including those usual permanent grants in consequence of the Union, amount to 650,000l. making the total for the two countries, 1,450,000l. The total amount of these articles of supply, which I have enumerated is 39,559,521l. But there is another article of supply to which, though I shall not call upon the committee to vote it at present, I shall still take the liberty of requesting the attention of the house. This article is one connected with a subject of the highest importance to the interests, not only of this country, but of Europe. Gentlemen are aware that we have been engaged in a continental intercourse and correspondence, with a view to objects which we must all admit to be of the highest moment. Sir, I have felt the sincerest satisfaction at finding a general conviction on the part of this house, that the ultimate security of this country is materially and intimately connected with the security of the continent. It must be the wish of every man who hears me, that that intercourse and correspondence should be so prosecuted as to restore peace upon grounds calculated to produce and establish that ultimate security which is the object of all our wishes and all our efforts. But seeing what we do see, and knowing what we do know, it would indeed, sir, be rash and presumptuous in us to entertain an expectation that that great object can be attained without further sacrifices on our part. I will not go into details upon the subject at present; they will more properly belong to a future discussion; but feeling it to be my duty not to postpone the general supply for the service of the year, I have thought it to be of extreme importance to make such an addition to it as to enable his majesty to afford, with effect, any succours which it may be deemed necessary to afford; with that view, sir,. I have deemed it advisable not to postpone making provision for those pecuniary succours, in case they should he called for.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0287"/>
<col>545</col>
I state them at 5 millions. This, added to the total amount of supply which I have had the honour of stating, will make the joint charge of the two countries, under the head supply, 44,559,521l. But the committee are aware, that from this gross sum there must be deducted two-seventeenths which Ireland is bound to pay, and two-seventeenths also for the civil list, and other charges on the consolidated fund, not relating to the public debt. The two-seventeenths of the gross amount of supply amount to 5,242,296l. and the two-seventeenths for the civil list, and the charges on the consolidated fund to 160,806l. making a total of 5,403,102l. This sum, therefore, is to be deducted from the 44,559,521l.; leaving a total of supply for G. Britain alone of 39,156,419l.&#x2014;But, sir, it is also necessary to take notice of some separate charges which are to be added to that amount, and which do not belong to Ireland. There is a sum which J shall propose to vote of one million on account, towards the discharge of a debt due to the East India Company. A considerable progress has been made in the examination of the accounts; but I am inclined to think, that it will only be necessary to provide one million now. There is besides a sum, for the deficiency of the malt in 1803, amounting to 320,000l.: there is also a further sum to be added, to complete the payment of claims from America, amounting to 4l4,000l. In addition to this, there is to be added the deficiency of the sum voted last year on the growing surplus of the consolidated fund. That surplus was taken at 5 millions, but it appears that there was a considerable diminution of revenue in some articles. But, sir, when the committee consider the average produce of the revenue for the last 3 years, they will see that the diminution is of a temporary nature, and by no means so -discouraging as it may appear at first. It seems, sir, that the calculation of the growing produce of the consolidated fund last year, was made upon the former year, a year of almost unexampled produce; the diminution therefore, will appear to be greater on that account. The deficiency amounts on the whole to the sum of 2,80O,000l. making the amount of these separate charges which I have enumerated, 4,534,000l. which, added to the former sum of 39,156l, 419l. makes a grand total of supply for England alone of 43,690,419l: But for

<title>WAYS AND MEANS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01285">I proceed now, sir, to the Ways and Means for raising this supply; The first article is the duty on mall, and the personal estate duty, 2,750,000l. The next is the surplus of ways and means of the last year. Upon this subject, I think it necessary to give some explanation to the committee. It appears by the disposition paper which has been laid before the-house, that there is a surplus of 123,146l.&#x2014;a sum of navy debt of upwards of 120;000l. There is also the sum of 931,000l. out of the vote of credit for the naval service, which is to be added to what was not called for by the end of December 1804. But as the demands upon the navy are paid in bills, and as bills encrease with the service, there is a larger sum of bills at the end of the year. The result therefore is, that there is a sum of upwards of 120,000l. not called for; 11,188,000l. was only called for, including the vote of credit of 931,000l. But still of course, though not called for, there is an increase
<image src="S1V0003P0I0288"/>
<col>547</col>
of debt to that amount. But after all, there will remain a surplus of the Ways and Means of 1804, to the amount of 1,192,115l. It may here, sir, be proper to say, that the amount of the navy debt is less than it was at many periods of the former war.&#x2014;The next article I proceed to is the surplus of the consolidated fund to the 5th April 1806. In considering this part of the subject, I shall pursue the plan of taking the amount of the permanent taxes for 3 years, and setting against, them the amount of the permanent charges. The total amount of the taxes for 3 years, exclusive of the years 1803 and 1804, which were years when additions were made to them, was 90,590,000l making on the average a sum of 30,199,000. for each year; m which are included the additional duties on sugars, malt and tobacco, which produced a large temporary amount, against which I set two millions of exchequer bills voted; this will make the average of each year 28,199,000. The duties imposed in 1803 and 1804 produced 1,315,000l. which will make the average 29,514,000l. But there is an addition to the consolidated fund of 1,381,000l. from Ireland, for that part of the debt with which she is charged; there are also two Other articles, which will make the whole sum to be added 2,866,000l. making the whole amount of average for each yearS2,381,000l. Against this I have only to state the sum of 28,032.000l. of permanent charge for us, that is, the interest of the debt, charges of management, &amp; c. 26,692,000l. the Civil List, 960,000l; charges added to the consolidated fund, 380.000l. making altogether the sum I have stated of 28,032,000l. which leaves a sum of 4,349,000l. to be carried, as the probable amount of the consolidated fund. I have taken the average of 3 years, and taken also the deficiency of last year, arising from causes which I cannot but consider as temporary. It proceeded in a great measure from stock in hand having been taken in malt, spirits, tea, and wine. In the article of wine, this operated in a double capacity; for first, the duty was lowered, with a notice: that it would be encrcased at the end of the year. The consequence of this was, that persons, of course, laid in a larger stock before the increase took place. This deficiency arose, as I said, from causes in their nature temporary, and therefore I shall on a future day, propose to make the duty on wine permanent, having no reason to doubt that these fluctuations will
<col>548</col>
cease. But after all, the total difference of the deficiency of last year, and the average of three years, is not more than 1,200,000l. Gentlemen, therefore, I am sure, will not be disposed to think this so great a fluctuation. But, sir, I shall only take credit for 4 millions, as the surplus of the consolidated fund to the 5th of April 1806.&#x2014;The next article is the property tax, and the other war taxes. The war taxes were taken last year at 9 millions, but I shall take credit only for 8,300,000l. It must, sir, be a source of great satisfaction to the' country, that the war taxes are so likely to realize nearly the amount at which they were estimated. The property tax, I find, produced last year the sum of 4,600,000l. But the year 1804 has not received all its benefits, a part has not come in, and may be defrayed by Exchequer Bills; in like manner, what is granted for this year is applicable to the next year, and what may be due will remain for exchequer bills. Adding the 4,600,000l. this year to what is due, the amount under the head of property tax will be 6,300,000l I therefore take that as the amount of the property, tax for the present year. But still, sir, I feel it to be my duty, however reluctant I may be to do it, to propose to the country, (above the interest which it may be necessary to provide for the Loan), by a great exertion of its spirit and its vigour, to keep down as much as possible the accumulation, of the public debt: a system, the benefits of which are felt more and more every year, and which we had never more occasion to contemplate with satisfaction than we have at present, when we consider the terms on which we have negotiated the loan, which I arranged finally this morning; subject of course, to the approbation and ratification of this house. I shall now propose the addition of 1&#x2013;4th, or 3d. in 1s. of the Property Tax, which I calculate will produce 1,150,000l. This will make the whole amount of the war taxes and property tax 15,750,000l. I addition to this I shall take credit for 300,000l by way of lottery. To this is to be added, the loan for England separately, of 20,000,000l. I will now recapitulate the different items of</p>

There is a further sum for the service of Ireland, one million of which I propose to raise in Ireland, and 2&#x00BD; millions an England; the 2&#x00BD; millions will be on the same terms as the loan for the service of England, though the interest for that sum, as well as of the one million to be raised in Ireland, will be to be provided by Ireland.]</p>

<title>THE LOAN.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01288">I have now, sir, to state to the committee the terms upon which the Loan has been negotiated. They are for every 100l. Subscribed to be given to the subscriber 150l. 3 per cents, and 22l. in the reduced, creating 172l. stock for every 100l. borrowed. In the last year 10 millions were raised in the same stock, creating a capital of 1821. stock for each 100l. borrowed we have, therefore, the satisfaction to find, that we have negotiated a loan more than double the amount at a capital less by 10 per cent, than the capital created last year. This circumstance, sir, is to be attributed, first to the prosperity of the Country, and secondly to the firmness of parliament, in consenting to furnish so large a sum within the year, and to the progress of the sinking fund, which is already found to be rapidly repaying the country for the sacrifices it has resolved to make. The interest upon the loan is less by 6s. than the interest upon the last loan. In reference to the price of the stock, I think that 18s. and a fraction beyond the price at which the stocks closed on Saturday is the bonus; to that must be added the usual allowance of five per cent, for discount on prompt payment. But. the bonus if they do not pay at once is about 3l. 1s. 6d. This bargain, I am sure, sir, will be satisfactory to the country; it will also be satisfactory to the country and to the house to hear, what I have learnt since I came into the house, that the bargain is likely to be advantageous to the contractors. We must ail be happy to hear, that what is fair and frugal to the country will he safe and advantageous to the contractors. I shall now proceed to state the additional annual charges that will be created
<col>550</col>
by the loan and by the fund created for the payment of the loyalty holders. The interest on the 20 millions is 5l. 3s. 2d. pet cent, but including the sinking fund it will be 61. 17s. 6d. The interest on the Loan will be 1,376,000l. To this is to be added the charges of management; the 3 per cents created for loyalty holders, amounting with the interest of the loan, to 1,537,192l. For this sum it will be necessary to provide by</p>

<title>NEW TAXES.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01289">I shall first propose an addition of one penny on each single letter sent by the general post; 2d. upon double letters; and 3d. on treble letters. I am not able to make any precise calculation of the amount of the tax. In the same way I shall propose an addition upon letters carried to the vicinity of London by the two penny post; the addition will be one penny. I shall also suggest the propriety of imposing an additional duty of 2d. On foreign letters. I estimate the produce of this tax at 230,000l.&#x2014;The next is a tax upon salt, The addition I propose, is to add 5s. a bushel to-the 10s. now paid. On the average of 3 years, I calculate the produce of this tax at the sum of 4.90,000<i>l.</i> In this article, we carry on a great export trade to Europe, and I have every reason to believe, that the foreign markets cannot be supplied on cheaper terms-by any other nation. The addition, I propose, cm the export of salt, is 6<i>d.</i> a bushel. I estimate the produce of this duty at 80,000<i>l.</i> The next is an addition to the tax upon horses kept for pleasure, and for the purposes of husbandry. On horses kept for pleasure, I propose to add one-fifth to the present tax. It is now levied according to the numbers kept. On horse pays 40<i>s.</i> duty, and I propose to add 8s. thus following that rate. This, upon the average of 2 years, will produce 110,000<i>l.</i> I take the average of 2 years, because 3 years ago there was an additional tax imposed. I do not think I am likely to be in any great error in my calculation of the produce, for though an addition was made in 1802, the number of horses kept for pleasure has been increasing since. On horses kept for husbandry, I propose to make the 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> now paid, a pound. This, I calculate, will give a sum of 320,000<i>l.</i> But I think it right to state, that upon those which only pay 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> and not 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> I do not propose to lay any additional tax.&#x2014;The last tax is an increase in the duty upon Legacies. My first proposal, will be to impose a small sum upon direct
<image src="S1V0003P0I0290"/>
<col>551</col>
legacies on which no duty is paid now: the sum I wish is 1 per cent. Gentlemen will see that it must be difficult to estimate the amount of this tax. By a rough guess the amount of capital bequeathed in wills registered, is annually about 30 millions. Deducting 5 millions for legacies charged on land, and 5 millions collaterally, 20 millions will then remain, which, at one per cent, will give a produce of 200,000<i>l.</i> The next is to supply an omission in the act, which could not be intentional. I mean the legacies charged on land. I propose to subject them to the same tax, and that I calculate will yield 100,000<i>l.</i> The only other addition is on legacies to strangers in blood. I propose to raise the duty on legacies of this description from 8 to 10 per cent, which will furnish a sum of 30,000<i>l.</i> I will now recapitulate, first the amount of the interest of the loan, and next of the different taxes by which I propose to meet the charge created by the loan.</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01291">This, sir, is the whole of the supply and ways and means for the year. I shall not detain the committee any longer at present by trespassing further upon their attention. The view I have taken of the existing state of the revenue, is such as must be sufficient to give the most encouraging view of the public affairs. In the third year of a war, following so quickly a war of such extent, duration, and expenditure, it is in the highest degree gratifying to see, that the general produce of our taxes, the terms on which we have concluded the loan, the general situation of our commerce, and the state of our revenues, keep pace with the highest expectations we could possibly have formed. I have every reason to believe that the country at large is satisfied with the principle which we
<col>552</col>
have so happily adopted, of raising a large proportion of the supplies for the public service within the year; a principle, by the adoption of which we are enabled, not only to provide the means of maintaining the conflict ourselves, but are likewise prepared to make a manly, generous, and decisive effort, for the independence of Europe, should other nations be disposed to co-operate in so honourable a design. I shall conclude, sir, with moving, that it is the opinion of this committee, that towards raising the supply granted to his-majesty, the sum of 22&#x00BD; millions be raised by annuities, whereof the, charges of 20 millions are to be defrayed on the part of G. Britain, and 2&#x00BD; millions on the part of Ireland."</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01292"><member>Mr. Fox.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;It is not my intention, sir, long to detain the committee on the present occasion; but as the right hon. gent. has dwelt on the state of the continent in terms which, if I remained silent, might appear to be unexceptionable, I will trouble the house with a few observations. As far as the general sentiment of the state of the continent reaches, it has my hearty assent; but if it should be sought to pledge us by any thing which has transpired this night, as to the time when aid ought to be given to the continental powers, or any opinion as to continental alliances, in the, existing situation of this country and Europe, and considering too, the difficulty of forming any such, which the right hon. gent, himself has not disguised from usin his speech, I should, sir, for one, and I rather think the committee would be inclined to differ with the right hon. gent. In the mode of bringing this subject forward, which is of a nature unconstitutional, there is a palpable irregularity. Heretofore, every matter of vote was previously brought forward in a committee of supply, whereas, in this instance, it is first agitated in a committee of ways and means. The committee of supply is, however, the only regular place fur such a business: for the house ought, first of all, regularly to decide in a committee on the propriety of the vote, its amount, the time of granting the supply, and all the other preliminary circumstances, of the transaction. And if there was no reason for extraordinary dispatch, all this might as well have happened on the present occasion. From the course that has been taken, we might be supposed to agree to the propriety of the sum; and not even to object to an almost immediate appropria-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0291"/>
<col>553</col>
tion. As the vote stands, the house might seem pledged to the grant. The 'right hon. gent, might, accordingly, on any future day, tell the house that there could be no material objection to provide for the sum; yet, most probably, we should see occasion- to object not only to the lime and manner, but also to the quantum employed. Undoubtedly, sir, I can believe that the right hon. gent. has no intention to jock up the judgment of the committee, I dare say he meant the question of the propriety of the vote to be left to the house; but as, still, the house might be thought pledged in some sense to the measure, I have thought it my duty to guard against the possibility of surprise.&#x2014;With regard to the taxes, some of them appeal to me to be extremely objectionable. The tax on horses employed in husbandry is of this nature; for I know of no tax that could be more severe on a class of men more useful. Before imposing such a tax, every enquiry ought to have been instituted, as to the ability of the persons on whom it must fall to pay it, without the total ruin of their prospects. No doubt the right hon. gent. has enquired respecting this; but I apprehend that more enquiry than he can have made was necessary. This tax will assuredly be much felt in the country. I have also, sir, a great objection to the tax on salt; but as the propriety of adopting it will be discussed hereafter, I shall not now enter into it. In another view I could wish, sir, to consider these taxes. The mode of raising the taxes within the year has my approbation, in a general way. The principle, if not found to be inconvenient in its operation, is good. But here the operation of the principle cannot prove beneficent. It must operate vexatiously. All the taxes proposed to be raised are of a nature to cause the utmost inconvenience, and operate as an intolerable hardship. They are almost all of them direct taxes. Excepting the tax on salt, hardly any thing is proposed to be raised on consumption; yet the tax on consumption is probably the only legitimate tax. Nay, sir; I doubt whether hereafter we can have any taxes on consumption. When I am told that the taxes oa consumption, now subsisting, have experienced a considerable defalcation, I must be of opinion, that the sources of taxes have been impaired. Without doubt, the defalcation of 1,200,0.00l. on a revenue of 50 millions is not very alarming, provided it does not continue to en-
<col>554</col>
crease. But when a diminution to that amount does exist, I do think there is some ground for apprehending that our, taxes on consumption haves reached, the limit, beyond which they cannot be made more productive. Another ground of objection with me is, the tax on property. The addition now proposed, I am sorry to say, will, if I am not much mistaken, lay the foundation of endless calamity to this country. One great objection to the tax on income is, that it affords a facility of getting near what we would most lament, that state in which a minister could take the property of the subject indiscriminately. This is precisely what we have to lament in regard to the tax on property, which can only operate as a facility to that deprecated end. This time 25l. per cent, are added, possibly there will be next time 25l. per cent, more put on it; after that, possibly, it will be doubled, then, possibly, trebled, until the principle is silently, but fatally established, of taking the money of the subject wherever, and however it may be found. I have also another objection to this tax, that though it is less unequal than the income tax, it is still very unequal. Landed property and property in the funds contribute fairly. But the other descriptions of property, such as arise from commerce and industry, do not pay in any proportion. If this is the case, I tremble for the consequence of going on increasing this tax. If a property tax be allowable^ even in time of war, it is only on the ground of its being regular and moderate. If this is to continue many years, and consumption, so far as yielding a revenue, is at I an end, it is likely the property tax will be considered as a land tax, or any of those other taxes that are voted annually as matters of course. I do not say that this crisis is near, God forbid it should be! If ever we come to the state when we cannot levy taxes on consumption, we shall inevitably be going the road that leads to the point at which we take from our income, where we can, and all we can, till we go to the principal, and in time take that like wise. With these impressions of the vast impolicy of such a growing tax as this, I own to you, sir, that I do from my heart wish the right hon. gent. could have devised any other measure. I never approved of this tax, nor of the principle on which it was founded, and I think that limits should be set to it which cannot be exceeded. In my mind, the taxes proposed, particularly
<image src="S1V0003P0I0292"/>
<col>555</col>
that oh salt, will be found highly exceptionable, and I do from my conscience believe, that others less oppressive must be eventually resorted to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01293"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;I do not intend, sir, to take up more than a very few moments of the time of the committee doubtless, meant the proposal respecting the vote for 5 millions to be as conditional as it has been spoken of by the hon. gent. I certainly did not mean the house to be pledged to the application of that sum, without full evidence of the policy of such a measure; only when the subject of the general ways and means for the year were before the house, I did think it right to bring before the committee the amount which I apprehended would be necessary, in case certain events should take place. Hat as to the time of applying that sum, the manner of its application, those circumstances of the state of Europe under which it may be wise and politic to apply it, on all, that the house will hereafter decide. Other motives induced me to bring the subject forward now. I thought it necessary, not to defer the vote, because nothing can take place in the state of things that has not taken place, except either the acquiescence or the refusal of the powers of the continent to enter into an alliance with us. On the other hand, it was desirable that the business should be brought forward early in the session, because from the lateness of the period at which this session commenced, if we did not provide for the vote now we should drive it later into April, when near a quarter's interest would unnecessarily attach to it, which, on the fair supposition of the funds being worse than they are now, would occasion a diminution of our means of providing for the general loan. Now, sir, as to the vote in itself, I could only say, that with regard to voting a subsidy of 5 millions for continental purposes, when the day comes for the house to take such a proposal into consideration, gentlemen will do as they please; in the state of the question at this moment they are pledged to nothing. With respect to the observations on the mode in which this subject has been brought forward to night, there is no informality at all in bringing the question forward in the committee of ways and means. It is, most certainly, not unconstitutional. I still agree with the hon. gent, as to his general doctrine, that this and similar votes ought never to be pri-
<col>556</col>
marily moved, except in a committee of supply; but {thought it right to open the subject this night, from the considerations which I have stated above. Thus I have not only been careful to preserve the freedom of opinion on all parts of the question of subsidy, but to prevent all objection even, in point of form. For if the house should not be of opinion to allow the subsidy, the 5 millions designed for that purpose will remain to be applied to other services. With respect to this taxes, the hon. gent, wishes to reserve the more particular discussion till the bills shall be before the house; but even in the present instance, he laments that they are not on consumption. He thinks them too direct. I may think with him in a great measure, as to the superior advantages of a taxation wholly, or almost wholly, indirect. But, sir, will the hon. gent, gravely contend, that all the taxes of this night are direct taxes. On the contrary, the tax on horses kept for pleasure is a tax on use, which is in the nature of a consumption. There is another tax on horses, that on horses employed in husbandry, which keeps pace with the industry of the country, and which cannot be said to be a direct tax. The article of the post-office, that tax is growing with our commerce, and our means of general, regular, and prompt conveyance of intelligence, and all other topics or transactions of business which can be discussed by letter; a tax which attaches to a medium of universal communication, every way calculated to encrease and to render progressive the best means of national and general correspondence, which at the same time increases and renders progressive a most advantageous branch of our public revenues. These last, though not directly taxes on consumption, fall upon the articles made use of for purposes of consumption, and out of the 1,500,000l. 1,100,000l. may be fairly stated as laid upon consumption. These articles have, for the 3 last years, been subjected to many new and un avoidable burdens; but it is no slight argument in their favour, that the encrease is not attended with any diminution of the wealth, prosperity, or convenience to the country: Now sir, I will leave the committee to judge whether all this be not more a confirmation of my hypothesis,; than of the doubts and-apprehensions which the hon. gentleman entertains. With regard to direct taxes, certainly they are more inconvenient; but they are also more econo-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0293"/>
<col>557</col>
mical than taxes on consumption. The best writers on the subject have said of direct taxes, that they are more inconvenient in the collection than doubtful in the principle and it would be most desirable to levy direct an indirect taxes, if peculiar circumstances did not render that far from probicable in the whole extent of a nation's wents. The objection to the property tax, I think a good deal lessened, by the consideration that it attaches most to those who have most, from which to contribute to the exigencies of the state; and as to the objection itself, that of its falling unequally on the persons whom it most reaches, I own there is an inequality yet still, as obliging persons to pay at all who paid no other, so far, I think the hon. gentleman will approve of the tax. Now, as to the increase of the tax, and the extent to Which it will go, no man can say with any certainty how much it will increase: and as to the consideration of the extent to which it will go, there is, on that ground, nothing more to be objected to this than to the horse tax the salt tax, or any other tax. If the tax is found such as the subject can pay. I see no reason why it should not, like other taxes, be augmented. Confident I am, that the more the productiveness of this tax is studied, the more will its beneficial effects be experienced. When I had first the honour of introducing the income tax, I took the sum total of the rental of the kingdom at 25 millions. The operation of this bill has however proved that the real amount is not less than 34 million, and assessments to that extent have been formed. There is no evidence whatever, that the commercial part of the kingdom do not pay their fair proportion: on the contrary, the assessments on this part of the public property, exhibits a fair and very extensive payment of the tax.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01294"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> denied that the arguments for the increase of the property tax were such as applied to all taxes. For when a house tax became too high, a man might avoid it by ceasing to keep any house; but property was a thing by which there could be no limit till the whole was taken. With respect to wine, tea, or any other articles of consumption, taxation might proceed without reserve, because the individual would always have it in his power, as soon as the tax became oppressive and intolerable to him, to desist from them, He therefore preferred taxation of this sort to proceeding on dangerous principles, taking

by little and little from, the property of the subject, till the reduction was tantamount to the risque of the whole, livery body knew how human nature was worked upon by every thing that assailed it by degrees. He remembered a fable, which, to elucidate the force of habit, related, that a woman in a certain village had a calf, which she accustomed herself to take in her arms every day, and from the gradual increase, was able to bear it when it came to be a large ox. The fable was a good one, but he did not like it in its application to the present case. For, however we might be able to bear this little calf, we could not possibly bear the great fat ox it would grow to. He, therefore Could not possibly approve of a tax that had no natural limit in itself.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[IRISH HASBEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01299"><member>Sir Evan Nepean</member><membercontribution> moved the order of the day for the 3d reading of the Irish Habeas Corpus Suspension bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01300"><member>Mr. R. Martin (of Galway)</member><membercontribution> rose and stated, that it was his intention to propose an amendment. Understanding that the principal ground for passing the bill, without instituting a previous inquiry, was the notoriety that a treasonable disposition existed in certain parts of Ireland, he trusted that he should have the support of those who maintained that such notoriety existed, in the amendment he should propose. To be consistent with themselves they could not withhold their assent to his proposition, which would go directly to the asserting of what they had invariably stated as the true grounds for the suspension.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01301"><member>The Speaker</member><membercontribution> interrupted the hon. gent. and stated, that the practice of the house was first to read the bill, previous to offering any amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01302"><member>Lord Henry Petty</member><membercontribution> said, he did not vise to occupy the attention of the house any farther, than by adverting to a precedent for a similar proceeding, quoted by an hon. and learned gent. (Mr. Ward) on a former evening, when he said, that the Habeas Corpus Act had been suspended in 1722, without any inquiry respecting the existence of any necessity for it having been instituted by parliament. Having since had time to examine into the grounds of that assertion, he thought it right to shew, though he did not see the hon. and learned gent, then in his place, that the two cases bore no analogy whatever to each other. At that time at least two-thirds of the king's speech were employed in pointing out the necessity there was for the house adopting such a measure. Even then, after considerable discussion upon the subject, there was,-he believed, the largest minority against it that was ever known in that house. And it was not finally agreed to, until sir R. Walpole, then one of his majesty's principal confidential ministers, had pledged himself that be would shortly lay such facts before parliament as would most fully justify him in having proposed such a measure. The disclosure of these facts, which took place
<image src="S1V0003P0I0295"/>
<col>561</col>
place in 2 or 3 months afterwards, certainly did bear him out in. the assertion which he had made. But now, where can the analogy be found? There is not a single word upon the subject in the speech from the throne. Can the hon. and learned gent. opposite declare, that he finds the analogy in what now exists in Ireland, or in what is likely to exist? If he does, that is an Argument for the inquiry, and not against it, as the house would then know upon what grounds they acceded to this extraordinary proposition, at a time when the necessity of the case is so far from being notorious, that every one of those gentlemen most intimately connected with that part of the kingdom, have declared, that, as far as their own knowledge could extend, the country was1 completely tranquil, and was as well disposed towards his majesty's govt. as any county in England. Until some inquiry was made, or until some pledge was given that a statement, similar to that which sir Robert Walpole had promised, and afterwards made to the house, should be given in the present instance, he could not, consistently with his duty, in the face of such a precedent, agree to the passing of this bill.&#x2014;After the bill had been read a third time,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01303"><member>Mr. R. Martin</member><membercontribution> stated, that it was his intention to embody in the bill the reasons which had been given for passing it. The measure would not be operative in. its effects, unless it were general, and applicable to every part of the united kingdom. As the law stood now, and as it would stand under this bill, persons may come from Ireland to this country, and carry on their machinations with safety against the constitution of that part of the union, To counteract this, he submitted to his majesty's govt. whether it would not be advisable to extend the salutary operation of the bill before them, to Great Britain as well as Ireland. How could the two countries be said to be identified, if martial law was to be established, and the Habeas Corpus Act suspended in one and not in the other? If it was not necessary that the two countries should be identified, he could, conceive no measure so well calculated to give it proof, as the bill-before them. For the purpose of making out sortie sort of justification of the measure, and of affording some supporters of the bill a plausible ground for the vote they, should give, he would propose, that, the preamble of the bill should commence
<col>562</col>
with these words: "whereas it is notorious that traitorous conspiracies are carried on between wicked and disaffected persons in Ireland, and persons resident in France." &#x2014;The amendment was put and negatived without a division; the bill was read a third time, passed, and ordered to be sent to the lords.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[REPORT OF THE BUDGET.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01304"><member>Mr. Alexander</member><membercontribution> brought up the report of the committee of ways and means of yesterday. Several resolutions were read and agreed to without any discussion. Upon the resolution being read, which goes to state the agreement of the house to the levy of an additional 25 per cent, on the property tax,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01305"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> rose, and requested, some explanation of the nature of the exemption from the property tax, allowed, to the holders of the loan. He did not altogether understand it as it was formerly stated.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01306"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> observed, that it was not strictly an exemption, but a forbearance for a time, till the instalments should he paid up. When the loan was converted into stock, and the first dividend was paid, then it would of course become subject to the tax as well as other property.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01307"><member>Mr. Johnstone</member><membercontribution> expressed his regret to see so little disposition in the house to examine closely into the subject of these resolutions, which was of so important a nature, that he should not feel that he did his duty, if he passed it over in silence. The house, he was sorry to say, was not put in a state to judge so accurately on the subject as it ought to have been. Certain accounts had been ordered by act of parliament to be annually laid before the house. It was true, that they were not in strictness required to be laid on the table previous to the 25th of March; but since the budget had been brought forward so early this session, it might have been expected that the accounts deluded to should, have been presented in time sufficient to enable the house to examine the subject with the requisite degree of information. We wanted an account of the public income and an account of the disbursements. The distribution paper ought also to have been presented sooner, with an account of the consolidated fund, A confusion also arose from its being stated that the expenditure would be 44 millions, and provision was made only for 35 millions. Then, there was a million for the East India Company.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0296"/>
<col>563</col>
He assented to that sum. But he did it for reasons of his own, arid not for those alleged on the other side. The East India Company had engaged to pay 500,000l. annually to the public; and instead of that, this was the second time that they called upon the public to pay money to them. Notwithstanding this, it was contended on the other side, that the East India Company was in a flourishing condition, and we had recorded this by our vote, He hoped the subject would be at another period more fully investigated. There was also another resolution to which he was by no means inclined to give his assent. It was that which went to give 5 millions for subsidies to the continental powers. He trusted that no one would think that he contended that this island should keep aloof from continental connexion. The man did not deserve a seat in that house who could wish this island to be insulated in its interests and connexions, from the powers on the Continent, or who would not be desirous of contributing all in his power to diminish the preponderating influence of France upon the greater part of Europe, which he could not consider otherwise than as one family. He would therefore, chearfully grant any sum, which was likely to be applied with any effect to the diminution of the enormous power of the enemy; but, before he voted such a sum as this, he should expect to sec some prospect of accomplishing his object, by the co-operation of those powers bordering on France, such as Austria and Prussia; but, without this aid, he could anticipate very little effect from powers so remote from it as Russia and Sweden To expect a reduction of the power of France, by means of such allies, would be as wild and romantic As the. measures said to be taken by some of the agents of England, who attempted to accomplish their purpose by the force of two bottles of sympathetic ink, and the sum of 500 guineas&#x2014;.He also had great objections to the duty on salt. This house had voted, about four years ago, that it was highly impolitic to tax that commodity. It was strange now that it was proposed to tax it doubly. This he supposed was the difference between a weak and inefficient administration, and a strong and vigorous one. Another objectionable tax was that on horses used for husbandry. The right hon. gent, had lately given his assent to a bill which had for its object to courage
<col>564</col>
agriculture, and now he came forward with a resolution of this nature! Two years ago, when the war had commenced, the house had been pompously told, that the war would be carried on by 12 million of war taxes, without borrowing a larger sum than was annually reduced by the sinking fund. He, on the contrary, had stated, that the expenditure would amount to 42 millions, when our force was carried to its utmost extent, and that we should be compelled, to borrow 23 millions. The result now was, that our whole expenditure this year was upwards Of 49 millions, and amounted to 44 millions independently of the subsidy, and that the loan, in place of 7 millions, was 22&#x00BD; millions for England, and 2&#x00BD; millions for Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01308"><member>Mr. Francis</member><membercontribution> said a few words upon the subject of the million which was to be paid to the East India Company. This was the second time that parliament was called on to make an advance to them of the same amount; and yet every statement which was made of their finances, declared that they were at present in the most prosperous situation, and held out the most flattering prospect of increasing wealth in future. He would not say, that nothing was now owing by government to the Company; but he could not help remarking, that the 500,0001. which they had covenanted annually to pay the public, was never stated to have been actually so paid but once. But, in fact, there was no parliamentary evidence of the existence of the debt. The house had, indeed, the word of a right hon. gent, that it was so; but that was not a parliamentary ground Upon which they had a right to dispose of the public money; and it was evident to him, that neither the former nor the present sum ought to be paid without a parliamentary inquiry, and a satisfactory proof being given to the house of the existence of the debt. If it was proved that the debt did originally, exist, the house would then have to inquire, whether or no it was liquidated, or nearly liquidated. The Company would then have to give in an account of their stock, and would be obliged to make a deduction according to the state of the account between them and the public. If the statement given in the course of last session was strictly true, and that in reality the Company's debt from the country was neatly liquidated, than the legal consequence ought to be, that the Sum now required to be advanced
<image src="S1V0003P0I0297"/>
<col>565</col>
should be deducted, in order that the debt, now so near liquidation, should be finally extinguished. He therefore, wished to know whether this sum was meant in liquidation of the former debt?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01309"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> declared himself rather unprepared to give the hon. gent, a satisfactory answer; but he certainly did not propose to vote this sum without reserve, or without subjecting the Company to be called to an account for what may be due from its revenues to this country. The, vote now called for had no relation to, much less did it annul, any prior engagement; but both the hon. gentlemen were mistaken as to the purport off the act of 1793, which enjoined, that, after the Company should pay its dividends and expences, and have a surplus to a certain amount, then out of that surplus, it was to contribute half a million towards the general finances of the country, and be at liberty to apply the remainder to the increase of its dividends. This subject would best be referred to a future discussion, when the state of the East India) finances should be brought before them; but it surely would be allowed, that the Revenue and resources of the Company might be very prosperous, and yet, by the-intervention of two or three unexpected wars, be rendered inapplicable to the aid of the national revenue.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01310"><member>Mr. Johnstone</member><membercontribution> agreed, that the Company might have a just claim upon the public, but what he complained of was, that after declaring that they had a surplus of a million, instead of paying out of it what they owed to the country, the house should be called upon to discharge an old debt to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01311"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> explained, that the surplus so often mentioned was only stated to arise out of the territorial revenues of the Company, of which parliament had no right to claim any share, until it was brought home by investments, and all the charges on it paid. That indeed might be made the subject of a future claim; but as to the territorial revenue, parliament had no immediate right to interfere with it.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[SALT DUTY BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01312">Upon the resolution being read which proposes an additional duty upon salt,</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01313"><member>Colonel Calcraft</member><membercontribution> expressed a hope that the right hon. gentleman would reconsider that proposition. At a time when the lower order of the people were peculiarly
<col>566</col>
pressed on by the high price of every sort of provisions, he conceived it to be the duty of that house to consider that nothing which could be avoided should he added to the burdens which they so patiently bear. Salt was an article so generally and so necessarily used by every class of people, that an addition of 50 per cent, to the duty on that article must be severely felt by those who had already had the misfortune to feel too seriously the pressure of the times. While he was on his legs he should also notice the hardship of the tax upon horses used in husbandry being nearly doubled Person who were employed in raising the first article of necessity were entitled to some consideration. If they were not supposed to merit this consideration, the right hon. gentleman would recollect that they, like other dealers, might raise the article upon the consumer, and that the poor, who would be most likely to suffer by the operation of the additional tax on salt, would feel the pressure double by the advance which most probably would take place in the price of bread. The salt tax, however, he considered as most seriously affecting the lower order of the people, and hoped that if the right hon. gentleman could not provide a substitute for the additional tax on horses employed in husbandry, that he would endeavour to remove that now proposed to be laid on salt to some other article Which was not of such immediate necessity,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01314"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, he had already given the salt tax the fullest consideration, and that he should certainly persist in it, as he was certain it was not liable to the objections which the hon. gentleman who spoke last had urged against it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01315"><member>Mr. Sheridan</member><membercontribution> did not rise for the purpose of entering into a debate, but was called upon by the peremptory tone in which the right hon. gent, had declared-his intentions to persevere in the tax. The right hon. gent, had stated his opinion that the tax would produce more than any other he knew of with less pressure; but he could assure that right hon. gent, that no tax could operate so grievously, oppressively, and grindingly, Salt was an article of the most indispensable necessity to the poor. All their provisions of fish, pork, &amp; c. required a considerable quantity of it, and potatoes, now so happily become a general source of food for the poor, were
<image src="S1V0003P0I0298"/>
<col>567</col>
not sufficiently nutritious without a large proportion of that article. He could not but advert to a report of die committee on the table, which, as his hon. friend had stated, declared that a diminution of the duty on salt would be beneficial to the trade, manufactures, and commerce of the country, and if the present proposed increase were to be adopted, would have the effect of entrapping the manufacturers of that article who had entered into numerous speculations. The right hen. member for Christchurch could bear evidence, that the ruined salt works at Lymington, had been renewed on the Strength of the report of that respectable committee. What would it prove, then, but a trap to engage the manufacturers in a misapplication of their capital, when by the reduction of the duty it was expected that salt might be used as a manure, if the duty should be, on the contrary, increased? The late chancellor of the exchequer, whom the right hon. gent, would not now be disposed to run down, had also sanctioned the appointment of a committee, to inquire into the propriety of reducing the duty on salt. On the whole, therefore, if the present addition should be persevered in, he thought it his duty to oppose it in every stage.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01316"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> had but one word to say in reply. He was disposed to pay every respect to the, right hon. gent, to whom the hon. gent, had alluded; and he could not prove that disposition better than by adopting his conduct. The report had been made about 4 years since, when there was no war; and yet while that right hon. gent, continued a member of this house, no motion had been made for the reduction of the duty on salt, or for carrying into effect the report of the committee. He insisted, that both the hon. members who had spoken against this tax were mistaken as to its operation; for, considering how small a proportion fell on the lower orders of the people, he did not think there was a single article of general consumption that could be found better adapted to the purpose of raising a large sum of money with so little, pies-sure and inconvenience to the mass of the people.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01317"><member>Mr. Egerton</member><membercontribution> said, it always gave him pain to be obliged to say any thing against the taxes proposed for raising the necessary supplies; but, as the representative of the county of Chester, he could not avoid saying that that county would feel the
<col>568</col>
weight and burden of this tax in a very severe and exemplary degree indeed, as there were more salt works there than in any other county; and he hoped, therefore, that if the right hon. gent, did not agree to give up the tax altogether, he would, at least, devise some means of alleviating its pressure, in regard to that particular county.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01318"><member>Mr. Kinnaird</member><membercontribution> said, he had been expecting every moment to see some member from the North follow the patriotic example of the hon. gent, who had just sat down. As none of those hon. gent, however, had yet thought proper to rise, he would take the liberty of taking that duty on himself. The North in general, and the Highland* of Scotland in particular, that depended so much on their fisheries, would be considerable sufferers from this rise in the duty on an article so essential to the fisheries. The drawback he would allow removed in a considerable degree that objection; but there were many instances in which the drawback could not be easily obtained, particularly by such as employed the salt for their own use only. He contended that the exhorbitant rise of this article was every way impolitic, and believed that it would add considerably to the discontent of the lower orders, against the war in which we had engaged.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01319"><member>Mr. Rose</member><membercontribution> argued, that the drawback was a complete answer to every objection that could be drawn from the fisheries against this measure. The additional tax, in fact, was calculated to operate rather as a bounty, as it increased the amount of the advantage the fisheries already enjoyed over others. In regard to the injury individuals might sustain from having speculated in this article without receiving any previous notice of the measure now in question, he did not think much was to be apprehend* ed. In Hampshire, the county with which he was perhaps best acquainted, he was not aware that any such speculation bad taken place, or that any Lad consequences would result from it. He denied that it was a duty, the collection of which was attended with any extraordinary charges. The charge, he stated, did not amount to above 20,000l. and that therefore the duty was collected for not more than 2 per cent. This additional duty besides, he added, would be attended with no additional charge, as the expence attending the collection of the present duty would not be increased by its rise.</membercontribution></p>
<image src="S1V0003P0I0299"/>
<col>569</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01320"><member>Colonel Calcraft</member><membercontribution> stated, in explanation, that according to the report of the committee in 1801, the collection of the salt duty was attended with an expence of 100,000l. a year. Since that period perhaps the duty might have been collected at less; but if they might trust the report of that committee, the annual charge of that duty was as he had stated it up to the period of that report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01321"><member>Mr. Johnstone</member><membercontribution> allowed that the salt employed in the fisheries was free of duty, but contended that there were so many difficulties and impediments thrown in the way, that it was often difficult to get at the drawback.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[HORSE DUTY BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01322"><member>Sir Robert Buxton</member><membercontribution> opposed the tax on horses employed in husbandry; he thought it founded on impolicy, and injustice. On impolicy, because it would operate to the great detriment of a branch of our national industry, of all others the most essential to our well-being as a state; on injustice, because it would bear unequally on the subject, nay, that it would operate on only one class of people, the farmers of the kingdom. Instead of laying an additional fax of this sort, why did not gentlemen give up their privilege of franking, which would shew the people that the members of the House of Commons were ready to make sacrifices in their turn. The hon. bart. deprecated the idea of the war having excited disgust among the public. He believed there never was a war, the necessity and justice of which were more universally felt and acknowledged,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01323"><member>Mr. Windham</member><membercontribution> disagreed with the hon. bart. on this point, and hoped the house did not stand so low in the estimation of the public as to be obliged to prove its disinterestedness by a paltry sacrifice of this nature, which would be of no serious importance to the revenue. In fact, this privilege of members was to themselves a mere feather in their cap; a thing that was pleasant to them, as giving them a power of conferring small favours, and; as had been before observed, was almost the only little privilege that belonged to them, as members, which was independent of the favour of ministers. But with respect to the public, this privilege was important. It occasioned a much greater intercourse between the members and their constituents than there would otherwise be, and therefore contributed to give them more information of the wishes and; true interests of the public. This was not
<col>570</col>
all; to his knowledge that little privilege had in many instances called forth literary talents, or kept alive correspondence that v would otherwise have died away, without any advantage to the revenue. He was sure that this had happened in many cases when he had used his privilege of franking, and he was also sure that other members could from their personal experience confirm the truth of the general observations he had made.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01324"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> supported the expediency of the privilege of franking, but not altogether for the reasons given by the right hon. gent, who spoke last. The privilege was one that afforded a very great accommodation to the public. It enabled the members to carry on the very important business of their constituents, and frequently they must have various and extensive transactions to discuss. Hence the privilege was not only a distinction, but a most useful, if hot indispensable appendage to the function of a legislator. As to the saving that could accrue from the abrogation of the privilege, that again was, in the view of the subject of revenue, the least considerable in the world; for it would not amount to more than 40,000l. a year. He did not, however, by any means wish to tax agriculture heavily; and the tax under consideration had no such tendency. No man would think that arable farms would, by this increase of seven shillings and six-pence on the tax on horses used in husbandry, be taxed so as to injure agriculture, or induce the farmer or landowner to discontinue employing all the capital he now employed in arable farms. He agreed also with the right hon. gent, that no such mark of disinterestedness was required of them by the country. The fact was, that in the whole history of parliament, there never was a time when so great a proportion of the taxes were thrown on the higher orders of the community.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01325"><member>Sir Robert Buxton,</member><membercontribution> was ready to give the right hon. gent, every credit for the disposition he had always shewn to relieve the lower orders from the weight of the burdens of the state.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01326"><member>Mr. H. Lascelles</member><membercontribution> hoped the right hon. gent, would take some further time to consider on some of-these taxes. He agreed with the hon. bart. who had just sat down, as to the duty on horses used in agriculture, and, that it would prove a great check to it. He-referred to what passed last session

en the corn bill, and begged the house to remember, that it was then held forth as necessary to encourage the farmers to grow as much corn as possible; end this lax would, he feared, operate contrary to that desirable purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01327"><member>Mr. Fuller,</member><membercontribution> in reference to the tax on property, mentioned the case of one who should have much underwood, but which would not be in a yielding state for 14 years to come; now the present tax would attach on that kind of property, he apprehended, as much as if it was at this moment vendible, or as if it yielded a profit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01328"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> observed, that the tax would only attach on property mow convertible to its uses; so that the underwood, which would not be fit to cut these 14 years, would for that period not be liable to the tax.&#x2014;The other resolutions were now put, agreed to, and bills ordered.&#x2014;Adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[CONDUCT OF JUDGE FOX.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01330"><member>The Duke of Clwrence</member><membercontribution> addressed their lordships on the subject of the state of their proceedings with respect to the charges against the above judicial character. It was one, viewing the case in its different points of view, of such importance as he felt him-self called upon to deliver his sentiments upon it. The first consideration that presented itself, his royal highness observed, was, that their lordskips, the highest tribunal in the world, were about to exercise the functions in the case before them, to set a precedent for the conduct of future ages. God forbid! therefore, that any party views or considerations should enter into its investigation. Of the individual in
<col>572</col>
question he had no knowledge whatever. The first he had heard of him, was by the first notification of the proceedings in question to their lordship's house. They were, he conceived, then to determine what ought to be the form and course of the proceedings relative to the case of Mr. justice Fox. Their lordships were all aware of the important change made in the situation of the judges of England and Ireland, by the act of the 1st of his present majesty, and this was the first instance of the kind, which had come before them since that period; this consideration increased the importance of the proceedings before them, and to which were to be added, the high public situations in which the judges stood, who were moreover the representatives of the sovereign. Two different modes of proceeding presented themselves to their lordships' consideration: the first by suffering the matter to originate in the house of commons, where it could be proceeded with, either by mode of address to i the crown for the removal of the party, or by impeaching him before the high court of parliament; or their lordships could proceed with the matter as it stood before them. The same mode of proceeding, he thought, from the best consideration he was able to give it, to be decidedly preferable. In either of the modes by which the commons could proceed on such an occasion, their lordships would have an ulterior opportunity of deliberating upon the merits of the case, and deciding accordingly. This, he thought, would also be the most regular and expeditious way, although he thought, in such a case, all individual considerations ought to be out of the question. The disadvantages of the line of proceeding, as already chalked out, were too obvious to be dwelt on. But one consideration, in particular, struck him so forcibly that he could not forbear urging it. Supposing their lordships, on their investigation of the case, should deem Mr. justice Fox innocent of the alledged charges, and that the commons, afterwards, recourse being had to them, a very possible case, should vote an impeachment, which of course would come before their lordships far determination, what sort of answer could they make? The case ought to be considered and proceeded on with the utmost coolness and deliberation. What he thought the most advisable, as the case stood, was to propose to their lordships to suspend all proceeding in their house
<image src="S1V0003P0I0301"/>
<col>573</col>
for a given time, in order to afford the commons an opportunity of taking it up and, under the conviction that this was the preferable mode of proceeding, he moved, that the present order, relative to the committee of their lordships taking into consideration the matters alleged against Mr. justice Fox, be discharged, in order that the sitting of the committee be postponed for six weeks.&#x2014;The question, agreeably to the regular course of proceeding, being put upon the first part of his royal highness's proposition, namely, that of discharging the present order,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01331"><member>The Earl of Limerick</member><membercontribution> observed, that on the present occasion, of the great importance of which he was fully aware, he felt no sort of bias whatever in his mind: for his own part, he had no knowledge of the learned person against whom the complaint was made, or of the causes of complaint against him. He therefore came to the consideration of the question before their lordships, with a mind perfectly free and unbiassed. With respect to the proposition of the royal duke, though he felt regret at being obliged to differ on any point, from that illustrious personage, it was one which, on his own view of the case, lie entirely disapproved of. Though he was divested of ail personal consideration with regard to Mr. justice Fox, yet he could not discharge from his mind all considerations of his case, as an individual, labouring as he must, after what had passed in their lordships' house, under a certain degree of imputation, which a reference to his public character certainly enhanced. He must deem any proposition, tending to delay, or to retain him in his present very disadvantageous situation, as rather hard. That the learned judge was placed in such a situation as he alluded to must be obvious, when it was considered that a noble member of that house, of high character, distinguished abilities, and commanding eloquence, had come forward as he had done, and whom everyone must think would not have so come forward, unless he felt himself imperiously called upon by a sense of his public duty. That noble person had, in an address to their lordships, equal in point of eloquence and animation to any ever delivered in that house, twice come forward with Specific charges' against the learned judge, and in consequence, it must be supposed that a degree of doubt at best must attach to the character of the learned person, until such charges were disposed of. This situation must be ren-
<col>574</col>
dered the more painful and disadvantageous, when his judicial character was referred to. Under what a disadvantage must not a judge, so circumstanced, go the circuits, or dispense the law from the seat of judgment? Presiding in the circuits was a consideration very different with the judges of Ireland from what it was with the judges of South Britain. Since the recent additions ware made to the salaries of the judges in Ireland, a great deal of such increase was made to depend upon their going the circuits; this was probably done to ensure their, attendance upon that very important part of their duty. He deprecated whatever might tend to delay their lordships decision upon the case before them; the situation of an individual so circumstanced was to be considered&#x2014;the length of time it would be necessary to retain counsel, or keep witnesses in town. A further delay of any time would have the effect of sending the learned person back as, for so it must be considered, a disgraced man. Possibly, in the first instance, it might be better the proceedings had originated in the other house. But, with respect to the right, it incontestibly vested in either house. Not a word in the relevant acts of parliament could be construed as vesting the initiative in the house of commons. He thought that, as the case stood, it would in every point of view be preferable to let the matter proceed as it had begun in their lordships house, who, in considering the matter, would of course be guided by no considerations, save those duties, which the nature and importance of the case imposed upon them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01332"><member>The Earl of Carlisle</member><membercontribution> expressed his difference in opinion, in certain points of the case, from the noble earl who had just sat down. Though he was certain their objects, namely those of public and individual justice, were exactly the same thing. To adopt the proposition recommended by the illustrious personage would, even in point of expedition, be preferable. The suspension of the proceedings in that house, for six weeks, would, on the other hand, involve no surrender or abandonment of any of the essential rights or privileges of that house. But it would certainly produce a most essential benefit. The intended mode of proceeding would, on the other band, involve the greatest difficulties, one of which was, the probability of their having to appear in a double capacity; first, in that of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0302"/>
<col>575</col>
a grand jury, and afterwards by a metamorphosis, not very congenial to the principles of the constitution, in the characters of judges, in the ultimate result, upon the case. In. that event, it could not be said, after investigating the case previously, they could come to judgment with minds perfectly unbiassed. Upon the whole, he deemed it preferable to suspend the proceedings for a given time, and take the chance of the other house proceeding in the business; as they were, every step they should take would involve them in fresh difficulties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01333"><member>The Earl of Westmoreland</member><membercontribution> observed, that viewing the question as he did, the real merits of which lay in a narrow compass, lie should give his negative to the propositoin of the illustrious personage. He deprecated every thing that tended to delay. Their lordships would recollect, that the case stood over since the last session, and that the parties on both sides had been summoned. His lordship adverted to the provisions of the acts by which the judges were placed in their present situations, and conceived the case to be such on the part of the house, as it would have been before these acts passed, with his majesty's confidential advisers, with respect to a question for the removal of one of the judges. That the proposition could be more expeditiously, as well as more regularly or constitutionally acted upon, by their lordships, he had no doubt. The advantages which their lordships possessed in that respect, their power of administering oaths, and recurring to legal assistance in particular, were many and obvious. The idea so much dwelt upon, of the possibility of a subsequent impeachment by the commons, he considered as no objection at all; the proceedings would go upon different matters of charge, and their lordships could therefore be no way pledged by any prior act of theirs. The case before the house would, be conceived, only lead to a question of renewal; the consideration of subsequent proceeding and impeachment would hot tend to embarrass their situation, and as to the particular case under consideration, he never heard of one that more loudly called for an immediate proceeding upon it. He conceived, circumstanced as the house was, referring to what had already taken place, the situation of the individual, and the steps which had been taken, they could hardly have an option upon the case; and
<col>576</col>
their lordships would do well, on the present occasion, to bear in mind the maxim in the great charter, which prescribed, that justice should be administered with as little delay as possible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01334"><member>Lord Auckland</member><membercontribution> observed, that were it possible to tread back the steps they had taken in the business, it would be preferable the matter should originate in the other house of parliament. But their lordships were not now in such a predicament, and they should bear in mind how the case stood; the matter was before them 7 or 8 months, and a committee appointed to investigate its merits to a certain, extent: this, though in the nature of an ex parte examination, would be proceeded in with all possible deliberation. As they were so far embarked, he saw not how they could well get over it but by proceeding. Should they, in the course of the investigation, find grounds for proposing an address, that should be followed up without any unnecessary delay, but discussed with all the attention the importance of the case required, and to the consideration of which their lordships would come with minds perfectly free from prejudice.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01335"><member>Lord Mulgrave</member><membercontribution> disapproved of any departure from the line of proceeding already resolved upon, and every objection, made to an immediate proceeding on the part of that house, was, in his mind, equally applicable to the other house of parliament. It was no argument against any species of proceeding in that house, to say that the commons possibly may not concur. Such a principle should never be laid down. He saw no advantage which could possibly result from a recurrence to the house of commons, in the present state of the business; the judicial character was one of the greatest importance, and whatever affected it should be seriously considered. And, in every view of the case, he thought it preferable to continue the present line of proceeding, but chiefly in those of regularity and expedition. A speedy decision, in such a case, was of incalculable importance, and as such he must oppose the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01336"><member>Lord Carleton</member><membercontribution> observed, that the learned judge in question was desirous of having the charges against him thoroughly considered, and anxious to confront the witnesses that should be brought forward. The consideration of his integrity, his fame, his high office, combined to render him anxious for an opportunity to come forward in his vin-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0303"/>
<col>577</col>
dication. He meant not then to say how far those charges were founded or not, against the learned judge, but he thought he was justified in assuming that some of them were not well founded, because they were withdrawn. In adverting, generally, to the case, there were some peculiar circumstances relative to the powers of the judges in Ireland, which, m some points, were very different from those of the English judges; and some of these immediately bore upon the object under consideration. The noble and learned viscount referred to the different acts by which the present situation of the judges was constituted; but, he stated, it was not until the year 1772, that the Irish judges were placed upon the same footing as those of England. With respect to the point immediately under consideration, the mode and course of proceeding in such a case, the acts were silent upon it; but the question avowedly was not of the powers of either house; it was a case of discretion with their lordships. With respect to the probability of the matter being taken up in the other house; that there were petitions presented long since, they knew, but nothing farther; and so far as they were aware, or could argue from appearances, the commons did not mean to proceed. Adverting again to the situation in which the character of the individual stood pending the discussions, he thought it would be preferable, that their lordships should proceed in the course already resolved upon.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01337"><member>The Marquis of Abercorn</member><membercontribution> stated, that his only object in coming forward, was the ends of justice, and to settle the case between the learned judge and the petitioners, on the part of an injured public. As to the form or mode of effecting that, he had no wish to express; and, though his opinion, from what he had heard upon the point, was decided, he had no wish to express that opinion. The discussion of the important subject under consideration had been, on all sides, treated with due gravity and decorum; there was, however, one exception. A learned lord, who formerly filled a very serious and grave situation, had, he thought, in some measure, departed from the proper mode of treating the subject. There were even appearances of a bias in his mind, and he regarded him as insinuating that he thought some of the charges were ill-founded, as he said he had abandoned them. With respect to the charges, his wish was, not to bring for-
<col>578</col>
ward any but what were of sufficient weight and importance. The reasons which induced him not to bring forward, the second time, those charges which were omitted, was specifically stated by him at the time; and these were, on the present occasion, referred to by the noble marquis.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01338"><member>Lord Carleton</member><membercontribution> spoke in explanation. He would leave it to the noble marquis himself, how far he had, in his expressions, departed from that degree of gravity and dignity which should always accompany discussions in that house. With respect to the charges adverted to, he only said, he had a right to assume some of them were not well founded, because they were withdrawn. He by no means alluded to the noble marquis, as having proposed them, knowing them to be ill founded; did the noble marquis know him as well as some noble lords in that house, he would not have so expressed himself; he never had a personal altercation with any man; he never made the smallest personal allusion to the noble marquis in what he said, still less did he attribute to him any improper motives.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01339"><member>Earl Spencer</member><membercontribution> spoke generally in support of the proposition. No individual Considerations, he thought, should weigh on such an occasion; their lordships should consider they were about to set a precedent on a case of the highest importance; a circumstance which should outweigh all minor considerations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01340"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> observed, the more be considered the subject in question, the more he was confirmed in the justness of the objections he bad offered on a former night. By what fell from a noble lord opposite, he was misconceived in what he said on a former night; what he had said was, that when the commons had decided upon a vote of impeachment, he could not conceive any ground upon which they were not bound to agree to an address for removal in the first instance. With respect to what had been said that night on the ground of delay, proceedings of the kind involved a kind of trial in the house of commons as well as in that house; of this the case of Mr. Hastings, who was heard in his defence at the bar of that house, was an instance, as was also that of sir Elijah Impey, though the events were different. However, with all possible respect towards the house of commons, he thought, that, in the particular case before them, truth and justice were more likely to be obtained
<image src="S1V0003P0I0304"/>
<col>579</col>
by pursuing the investigation, as resolved open by their lordships, than by referring it to the commons. No material inconvenience could arise even in the event of the contingencies so often alluded to, and he trusted the investigation, either with reference to the private or public interests involved, would be proceeded on with as little delay as possible. He should, therefore, object to the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01341"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> declared, that a more extraordinary doctrine he had never heard laid down gravely in that house, than that one and the same individual should be tried twice for one and the same offence. There was no court of justice in his majesty's dominions, that would for a moment entertain the abominable proposition. The act, he believed in his conscience, was passed to prevent persons who were incapable of performing the duties of their office, or who might be immoral characters, from longer holding the situation of a judge. It was a sort of milder punishment than that of impeachment, which was derected to something criminal. When he heard a noble lord make the assertion, that it was most proper that the persons who commenced the investigation should go through with it and come to a decision on the case, he might suppose that the ordinary proceedings of our courts of justice were nearly at an end. He might expect to hear the noble lord come down to the house to-morrow, and move to ever turn the whole system of the justice of the country. The ordinary and established manner of proceeding, was for a grand jury to hear only one side of the question, and on that to find a bill; but then the same persons did not go on to the conviction of the party accused. It would be remembered that in the case of Warren Hastings, the other house, when the charges were alledged against him, gave him an opportunity of being heard at the bar in his defence, before a single article of impeachment was made out against him. They then brought him before this house, which, by virtue of its superior privilege, examined witnesses upon oath. In the case of sir Elijah Impey also, a defence was made at the bar of the other house, and in con-sequence of that defence the charges were set aside. The house of commons therefore were properly the grand jury, who undertook the first investigation of the charge, and either founded a proceeding on it, or rejected the accusation. This was, as it is by its
<col>580</col>
constitution, the court of justice, the province of which it was to examine the business more minutely, and to come to such a decision as the case might warrant. Notwithstanding, by the word of the act of parliament upon which this proceeding was grounded, the accusation had a right to be begun in either house, yet the idea of the same persons making the first enquiry, so as to sift out the nature of the crime, and afterwards pronouncing judgment upon the case, was so repugnant to every principle of British legislation, that he thought it best to leave the other house an opportunity of taking up the measure, if they should think fit. He was the more inclined to do so, as, if he was not misinformed, the delay which had already taken place in that house was occasioned by the petitions not having been renewed. The short delay which had been proposed would only give them an opportunity to renew the petitions, and then the business would come in its regular course before this house. He therefore supported most cordially the motion of the noble and illustrious duke.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01342"><member>Lord Sidmouth</member><membercontribution> said, that in the natural division of the respective duties and privileges of the two houses of parliament, that which was judicial seemed to belong as peculiarly to the chamber of lords, as that which respected finance belonged to the chamber of commons. He by no means questioned the right of either house to originate subjects of every kind, but their lordships well knew that the chamber of commons did in fact claim and exercise the right of commencing questions of finance; and it could not be denied but that, the house of lords, by possessing the power of administering an oath, was peculiarly fitted for the discussion of judicial questions. He therefore thought this question properly began here; and he could see no just ground whatever for the delay of six weeks; at the end of that time they might be in the same situation as they were now. It was of the utmost importance that the matter should be deckled on forthwith. The noble lord who spoke last, seemed to resolve the power of the two houses as to inquiry into the conduct of judges, into the single case of supervening imbecility. Now, he thought, that this was a case more suited to ministerial arrangement, and of which the noble and learned lord on the woolsack would feel it his duty to take cognizance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01343"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> said, that he could scarcely
<image src="S1V0003P0I0305"/>
<col>581</col>
believe that the noble viscount had been in the house when he spoke, so totally had the noble viscount mistated what he had said. He had expressly enumerated three grounds upon which the two houses would feel it their duty under the act of King William to address his majesty; 1.crime in the execution of his duty; 2. criminal conduct not in the execution of his duty; and 3. supervening incapacity.&#x2014;The question was again put, on which their lordships divided, when there appeared for the motion of the duke of Clarence, 63. Against it, 36. Majority 27.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[IRISH HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01344">The order of the clay for the second reading of the Irish habeas corpus suspension bill was called for. Previous to its being read,</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01345"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> adverted particularly to what had passed on a former night, in consequence of a motion of a noble friend of his (lord King) now absent, He contended, that the species of information required by his noble friend was of great importance to enable their lordships to understand the subject in question. It was right parliament should know upon what conditions those who were liberated from arrests were discharged; the production required was agreeable to the practice and usage on former occasions; he was at a loss to know upon what grounds that which transpired between govt. and those whom they deemed traitors or conspirators should be kept secret from parliament. However, the proposition originally made by his noble friend had been qualified, so as he thought would remove the objection then offered; and he should before the other order of the day was entered upon, move an address to his majesty, "that a statement of the conditions upon which persons liberated from arrests, &amp;c. should be laid before the house, except so far as the same may relate to information given, or to be given, respecting any traitorous proceeding," &amp;c.&#x2014;On the question being put,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01346"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> observed, that what he said on a former night had been misconceived. He said that he knew of no such conditions, not being aware of any proceedings in the way of release to which they might apply; but his objection was to the principle of the motion in the manner it was brought forward; and he repeated his conviction, that under such circumstances, and at such a time, to agree to such, a motion, might be productive of
<col>582</col>
consequences the most dangerous; neither did he approve the motion as qualified by the noble lord; it would involve as admission of the fact, and its consequences in every other shape would be nearly the same. The specification required by the qualified proposition was, in effect, liable to the same objections, it would imply a degree of suspicion, as, with the other objectionable considerations, would amount to as pernicious a result as the original motion certainly would involve, and of which, he trusted, the common sense of their lordships would be sufficiently aware.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01347"><member>The Marquis of Sligo</member><membercontribution> supported the observations of the noble secretary. The disclosures alluded to might be of a most destructive tendency. His lordship alluded to some cases, as a correspondence with the enemy, in which a disclosure would be not only impolitic, but dangerous; and he adverted to the case of Oliver Bond, the remission of whose punishment might, in. a certain point of view, be said to have saved Ireland. The state of Ireland was in general good; yet, he thought the suspension of the habeas corpus act in that country, with a reference to certain circumstances, a prudent and politic measure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01348"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> said, that no person connected with govt. had stated any possible mischief that could arise from his motion, and he certainly saw none.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01349"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution> observed, that he filled the office of attorney general when the habeas corpus act was first suspended, and, though fully convinced as he was of the beneficial tendency of that suspension, yet, if such a disclosure as that now requested had been made, he should have thought it his duty, as speedily after as possible, to have moved for the repeal of the suspension. It would be better tolet the present bill expire, than to agree to such a condition as that proposed. He agreed with his noble friend as to the effects of the qualification of the original motion, and with the noble lord who had come forward, from his experience of the transactions alluded to, that there could be no degree of safety, nor could the beneficial effects of the suspension be expected, if such a condition was attached to it.&#x2014;The question was put, and the motion was negatived without a division.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01350"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> then moved the second reading of the Irish habeas corpus suspension bill, which was accordingly read a second time. His lordship then, pursuant
<image src="S1V0003P0I0306"/>
<col>583</col>
to his notice of Tuesday night, moved the order of the day for the consideration of the standing orders, No. 26 and 155, with a view to the suspension of the same, as fax as related to the Irish habeas corpus suspension bill. Before the question on this motion was put, his lordship stated, that, under the special circumstances of the case, he should have to propose that the bill be forthwith committed. He trusted the house would immediately concur in the obvious expediency of such a proceeding, and perceive, from a glance at the preamble of the bill, that no delay in the progress of the measure should take place. As to the necessity for continuing the suspension, he presumed to think that little need be said. Though he could assure the house, that at no period was the north of Ireland more tranquil or more loyal than at present, yet he was sorry that he could not say the same of every part of that country. The reasons for the suspension were notorious. It was perfectly known that there were not merely committees of Irishmen in France, but corps embodied, and in the pay of the enemy; that they held correspondence with disaffected persons in Ireland. And therefore he thought that if grounds had subsisted for suspending this glorious act, no less than nine times, in the course of the last war, much greater subsisted now. He concluded with moving to discharge the standing order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01351"><member>The Marquis of Sligo</member><membercontribution> took notice of the expression, that the north of Ireland only was loyal. He believed that every part of the country was loyal; taken in the mass, it was in a most perfect State of tranquillity; though he was ready to own that emissaries might be at work to sow disaffection, and that this bill might be necessary and useful to keep them quiet.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01352"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> explained, that he by no means intended to say that the north of Ireland only was loyal, but that he could not say so much of the tranquillity of every part of Ireland, as of the north.</membercontribution></p>

Acts of parliament were not subject to apoplexy. Their dissolution was necessarily foreseen, and it became the duty of ministers to explain to that house, what had prevented their introduction of this bill in time for it to undergo its regular investigation. It seemed necessary to create a new patent
<col>584</col>
office, to apprise ministers of the approaching death of their own acts. He was an enemy to this unexplained mode of depriving the subject of his most invaluable privilege, and trusted they would be told why all this unprecedented, speed was necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01354"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> assured the noble earl, that no peer could pay more sacred regard to the liberties of the people than himself. But in this instance there was no time to go through the usual forms, since the present act expired on Tuesday next, and there required time to forward the act, after it had received the royal assent, to that kingdom.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01355"><member>Earl Spencer</member><membercontribution> said, the question was not whether the act should be again suspended, but whether it should be suspended without inquiry? Parliament had now sat since the 15th of January. Why not, if the reasons for this bill were notorious, introduce it sooner, to give it the sanction of deliberate inquiry? As to the notoriety of the grounds for the suspension, he, for one, knew nothing of it, and was denied all means of know-ledge. A noble marquis who was well acquainted with the country, had said that it was in a state of tranquillity. Why, then, all this haste? Even departing from all the rules of the house, it was very doubtful, if even possible, that the act could arrive in Ireland in time; for it could not receive the royal assent before Saturday. It had been urged in support of the motion that the habeas corpus act had been suspended nine times in the course of the last war. He did not, however, recollect any instance, without-a particular case made out, or a previous enquiry. It was only said, that Irish traitors in France were corresponding with disaffected persons in Ireland. If that were sufficient, then, as long as there was a disaffected man in Ireland, and an Irish traitor in France, the French, govt. might make a case whenever it pleased to deprive us of the best security of our liberties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01356"><member>The Earl of Longford</member><membercontribution> lamented, the system of desolation that had prevailed in Ireland for ten years past. You, have heard of it, said his lordship, but we have felt it. You would give much to avoid the experience of such calamities. We would give much more to prevent their repetition. The people of Ireland look with confidence to a firm and vigorous govt. and they are ready to make sacrifices to deserve it. If it be a matter, of notoriety that a correspondence is now carrying on

The noble secretary spoke of his veneration for the habeas corpus, and yet in his actions sported with it in the most wanton manner. What had ministers been doing for the six weeks that parliament had sat, not to bring in this most important bill in time to allow the house to discharge their duty to the country?</membercontribution></p>

The other had come in on the express condition of withholding from the Irish this boon. Could he consent to give to such men this tremendous act without inquiry?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01362"><member>Lord Auckland</member><membercontribution> declared his conviction of the necessity of the bill, and at the same time could not figure any objection as to the propriety of discharging the two standing orders of the house, which, instead of being an infringement, was in itself a recognition of their privileges remaining in full force.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01363"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> was of opinion, that the node of proceeding with respect to this bill was directly in the teeth of the established farms of the house. It was a rule which ought always to fee most rigidly adhered to, never to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act except in cases of the last extremity. Now, he would ask, was there
<col>586</col>
an insurrection in Dublin? Was the danger so very imminent that no inquiry could be entered upon in consistency with a proper regard to the salvation of the country? Was a rebellion actually raging in Ireland? If there was nothing of this sort, then it was pregnant with the most pernicious consequences to the constitution, to agree to this measure without an enquiry. Inquiry would compromise the lives of no witnesses; it might be conducted with the greatest caution. No danger could be apprehended from it to the country. It would destroy no sources of intelligence, and upon no possible supposition could it reasonably be considered as calculated to produce any harm, la the course of last war no less than seven or eight enquiries had been instituted, and not one of them was attended with any pernicious consequences. It was true that this was not a new measure, it had been passed on the spur of the occasion, when a formidable insurrection was said to prevail in Dublin. No inquiry had been appointed at that time, nor, indeed, was there time for any in the light in which the danger then appeared. But as there was no inquiry at the original passing of this measure, so much the more occasion was there for an enquiry at this time. The ministers rested their arguments for this bill upon the notoriety of the case. Was such an insurrection in Ireland, why was not this fairly stated? If the disaffection was such as to render this measure necessary, why was an inquiry refused? So far was the disaffection in Ireland from being notorious, that no allusion was made to it in the King's message. On, the contrary, the constant assertion had been, that it was in a state of tranquillity. It was now said to be notorious for disaffection. For this, however, there was, nothing but the assertion of ministers. These were not grounds for the house to act upon. Parliamentary evidence of the necessity of the measure was requisite, before any consent could be constitutionally given, unless in a case of ultimate necessity. No such case existed in the present instance, or indeed was even attempted to be stated. He begged however, that their lordships would not misunderstand him. Whether or not insurrection or even Strong disaffection existed in Ireland he knew not. God knows, said his lordship, that as a private individual, I am much in
<image src="S1V0003P0I0308"/>
<col>587</col>
the dark en this subject, and certainly, as a member of parliament, I am completely ignorant respecting it. Many respectable lords who are members of this house, and who have, come from Ireland, have told us that there is a necessity for this measure. With me certainly their testimony is not without its proper weight. In deference to what they say, I am willing to admit that there may be a strong probability that the measure may be necessary. But as a member of parliament, I know nothing of the matter, and therefore it, is, that an inquiry appeals to me of so much importance. In what situation then am I placed? I cannot say that the bill is not necessary. Ought I therefore, to allow it to pass without any inquiry? No certainly. As. I, as a member of parliament, know nothing of the matter, the burden of the proof lies upon these who propose it. The plain line of conduct for me to pursue then would appear to be not to shew that it is not necessary, but to give it my opposition, because it has not been proved to me that it in necessary. His lordship concluded with saying, that there was, at all events, no parliamentary ground for agreeing with the recommendation of the noble lords on the other side, and, in the absence of all such proof he could not agree to dispense with the established orders of the house. If it should happen that the act should expire before evidence of the renewal reached Ireland, he presumed the government there would know so much what was required of them, as to continue it in force for a few days, and he knew that in doing so they would be indemnified by parliament. If, however, it, was the resolution of their lordships so far to overturn the ordinary resolutions of that house, as to allow the bill to go through more than one stage in a day, he thought they had better carry it through all its stages this night.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01364"><member>Lord Mulgrave</member><membercontribution> expressed his astonishment that the noble lord should have argued against a measure, which, on former occasions, had been adopted without any previous inquiry, and when there were no stronger grounds for it than on the present occasion. A bill of this kind had been passed year after year, without any parliamentary investigation, but merely on the notoriety of facts; it was not objected to in the manner it was at present; and would any one pretend to say, that there were not circumstances at this
<col>588</col>
moment as strong as any which had hitherto existed, to warrant an act of this kind? It had been stated that Ireland was at this time in a situation of great tranquillity, that there were no disturbances, no insurrection in that country. That such appearances might exist there he would not pretend to deny. But experience had taught us, that appearances were not to be trusted to. Every noble lord who heard him must recollect, that at a time when Ireland was understood to be in a state of the most profound tranquillity, when the people were said to be perfectly loyal, and when the Habeas Corpus Act was not suspended, that an event the most alarming and disgraceful that ever occurred in any country took place, that a dreadful insurrection broke out with circumstances of the foulest and most aggravated atrocity, and which were followed by the murder of one of the most upright and respectable magistrates who ever presided in a court of justice; such was the secrecy with which conspiracies had been carried on in Ireland, that a state of apparent tranquillity could never be considered as a proof of the loyalty of the people. And whatever might be said of Ireland at this time, it was well known that numbers of disaffected persons were still to be found there, and that they carried on a traitorous correspondence with others of their countrymen residing in France is lord-ships next took occasion to allude to the objection that had been made against reading the present bill in all its stages on the same day. He could not see how any well founded objection could be urged against a proceeding of this kind which, had often been adopted on former occasions. He well remembered that the noble lord opposite to him (Grenville) had in the month of April, 1798, brought in a bill to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act in England, without any previous parliamentary inquiry; and that the bill was carried through all its stages on the same day. There were apparently no more grounds for such a proceeding at that time than at present. Yet it was a proceeding in which parliament concurred almost unanimously. Several times since that period it was not thought necessary to institute any inquiry upon which a measure of this kind could be grounded. But noble lords should recollect, that notice had been given of the intention of ministers to propose the reading of this bill in all its stages; and that
<image src="S1V0003P0I0309"/>
<col>589</col>
notice having been received by their lordships constituted an order of the house, which amounted to an acknowledgment that such a proceeding was perfectly consistent with the visages and orders of parliament. There was nothing therefore, objectionable in what had been done: there was nothing out of the common order of parliamentary usage, and all objections must come with still less force when the shortness of the time was considered, and the necessity for passing this act. He should, therefore, conclude by assuring the noble lord, that it was the unalterable determination of ministers to have the bill read that very night in all its stages.&#x2014;Their lordships then divided on the motion of Lord Hawkesbury; contents 41; non-contents 13; majority 28.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01365">The house then went into a committee on. the bill, when.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01366"><member>The Duke of Clarence</member><membercontribution> addressed their lordships to the following effect:&#x2014;My lords, after having seen this measure brought forward without any previous inquiry, or without any single ground having been stated on which it can be justified or even defended; after observing the precipitancy with which it is attempted to be hurried through the house, I. should willingly reject it altogether, were it in my power, because it goes unjustly to deprive a large portion of the subjects of the kingdom of the benefits they are entitled to from the constitution. But as I fear it is not possible to reject the bill, I wish to propose an amendment that will have the effect of doing away some of its evil consequences by limiting its duration. I wish to introduce an amendment by which it shall continue in force no longer than 6 weeks. During that interval the ministers will have an opportunity of coming to their sober senses; they will have time to reflect on the nature and consequences of the bill, and to deliberate with themselves how far it may be expedient for them to renew it. If then it it should appear to them that it ought to be continued, they will be enabled to do so in a constitutional manner, by bringing down a message from his majesty, stating the existence of traitorous conspiracies in Ireland, and recommending such an inquiry and investigation, as may lay a just foundation for a bill of this nature. I therefore move, that instead of the word "six weeks after the next session of parliament," there be inserted the following words: "six weeks
<col>590</col>
after the passing of this act."&#x2014;The amendment was put, and negatived without a division. The bill having then gone through the committee, was reported, read a third time, and passed.&#x2014;Adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01368"><member>Mr. Windham,</member><membercontribution> in rising to submit to the house the motion of which he had given notice on the first day of the session, could not forbear calling the attention of gentlemen to the numerous postponements that had taken place with respect to it, none of which, excepting the last, had originated with himself. The only delay that was chargeable to him was rendered desirable and necessary by many considerations. The motion he was about to offer was almost precisely the same as that offered by
<image src="S1V0003P0I0310"/>
<col>591</col>
his hon. friend on the bench above (Mr. Fox), on the 23d of June last; The terms of it were, that it should be referred to a committee, to review the several acts passed in the two last sessions for the defence of the country, and to consider of such further measures as might be necessary to make that defence more complete. He saw many gentlemen on the other side of the house who had thought it most necessary to review the system of defence in the last session. He would ask those gentlemen, how they could think such a review necessary then, and not think it full as necessary now? He desired them to take the account as it stood then, and to consider in what respect the balance had been changed. It was necessary, to alter the state of the case, that some change should have taken place, either that the enemy's means of annoying us should have decreased, or that our "relative strength should have increased more than theirs. It was necessary also, that this diminution of our danger should not be a temporary cessation, but that the cause of apprehension should have entirely passed away. In his opinion, no material change had taken place. It was true some addition had been made to our force, but if even a greater addition had been made that would not be sufficient. The general: state of our military establishment was what it would be necessary to inquire into, and what had been done under the late defence act, to give us those improvements which were so generally allowed to be wanting before. Those who had voted for a Committee of Inquiry on this subject before, and one in particular who had gone further than all the rest (the present Chancellor of the Exchequer), were, he thought, particularly called upon to support his motion. He should feel extreme surprise if they should resist it, and was at a loss to think what reason they could possibly offer for such a resistance, except, indeed, they were prepared to confess they were wrong in their opinions at that time; that the measures they arraigned at that time had merits which they did not then see; and that the measures they recommended had deficiencies of which they were not aware. Was the right hon. the Chancellor of the Exchequer, prepared to say, that the whole of the additions made to our military establishment were made by his present colleagues, whom he then
<col>592</col>
opposed; was he prepared to say, that the measures he then declared bad were now good, and that the men he then censured as incapable, were now most capable? Was he prepared to say to those men, "your measures have been such, that if I had then the opinion of them which I have now, I would not have voted for the enquiry? Was he prepared to allow that every thing which had been done, and which was now available, was done by them? He was, indeed, himself prepared to allow, that the noble lord and his associates bad done much more than had been done since; but, as his opinion was not changed as to the positive defects of what they had done, he still continued of opinion that the inquiry was necessary; and he thought those who voted for it on the former occasion, could not do otherwise than support his motion now. If it was meant to be argued, that men were procured by the measures ultimately adopted by the late administration, and then in progress, he had never denied that the system of raising men for rank would procure men. He was ready to allow the force of family influence in Ireland and Scotland, but he contended that the principle of a system of recruiting by influence was injurious. It was not to be denied that the presumptive heir to an estate might raise money on an annuity, but such would be ruinous to him. The measure of recruiting for rank was one which he always objected to, not that he denied its power of raising men, but that he thought it a most pernicious mode of obtaining them. Thus the ballot obtained men of necessity, and a considerable force, almost all that had been obtained to meet the extraordinary exigency,. had been supplied by it, under the direction of the late ministers, so that whatever obligations the right hon. gent. opposite owed to it, he was indebted for to them; yet, whatever it had produced, could not reconcile him to the principle, any more than if the parish bill itself had produced men. He therefore saw nothing to diminish the necessity of enquiry. Alt the former objections to the state of our military establishment were still in full force; and he knew not how, after the failure of the measure proposed as a remedy, any member who voted for inquiry then, could avoid voting for it now. This, however, was a mere <i>argumentum ad homines;</i> for though a large part of the house, notwithstanding it was a, minority
<image src="S1V0003P0I0311"/>
<col>593</col>
then, had supported that proposition, he should not think it necessary on that ground alone, that they should support him. Men should be determined always by the evidence before them; many of the measures thus instituted had by this time been brought to trial; some might have justified themselves by their success; others had been decidedly condemned by their failure. The very circumstance of a Spanish war changed the situation of the country. But that was not all. It might have been said by the late ministers and their adherents, that the regiments raising in England and Scotland promised to be successful; that some of their other measures also had procured men, and that the army of reserve though suspended, had been amply successful, and might again be revived, and that a further trial of all their measures would prove the efficacy of them. To those who voted for inquiry against those ministers, he would submit a broad question as to the necessity of enquiring now. Whether the present state of this country, (not meaning by the present state the bare condition of the moment, but as far as the view could reach,) was not a consideration of more vital importance than had ever been before kuown? Whether an army was not necessary, not merely to enable this country to rank among the nations, not only to preserve her power, her distant colonies, and the other sources of her consideration, but even to preserve herself from year to year? Whether our situation was not like that of the feudal times, when a man was obliged to sleep with Ins sword under his pillow, and when he was under the necessity of keeping his armour by him even while at the plough? All that we saw around us abroad, all the domestic occurrences that had taken place here, all the military discussions that had taken place in that house, the result of which had been the turning out of the last ministers and the coming in of the present, which had turned our chancellors of the exchequer, and our attornies and solicitors general into colonels and generals, and which had rendered all the men in the country military, all this proved the extraordinary and imperious necessity for a great and permanent military force. The next question was, whether we had, or were soon likely to have such an army, as was necessary for an immediate exigency? The third question would be, whether our military system was commodious and well
<col>594</col>
constructed, so as to answer the public exigencies in the best manner; so as to yield the best possible force, or a force in some measure adequate to the expence and exertions of the country? Fourthly, supposing it answered all these requisites, had it that facility of recruiting so as that it could exist long and support itself without any new or extraordinary aid? Could these questions be answered, unless the state "of the country was different from that which he described it; unless we could soon have an establishment adequate to the exigency; unless the description of the force was good and in proportion to the expence we had been at, and the exertions we had made; unless it could be recruited and kept up so as to secure it from decay? Unless perfect and complete satisfaction could be given on all these points, there was a positive and undiminished necessity for the inquiry. We were told of the force of the volunteers, the militia, the army of reserve, and the regulars. One great objection to such a military establishment was its variety. It was not that there were light troops, and heavy troops, troops of the line, and troops on horseback, infantry on foot, or volunteers in carts; they might all have their particular services. What he objected to was their being on different establishments. Variety in nature might be very pleasing, but he did not think that was altogether the case in military establishments. If the volunteer system was good, why had we not all volunteers? If the army of reserve was good, why not make our whole force an army of reserve? But, perhaps, it might be said, they were for home service, and that it was necessary to have one sort of troops for one service, and one sort for another, like the man who had a great hole for his great cat, and a little hole for his little cat. He thought it better, before he proceeded, to examine the constitution of those four different armies; how far they were consistent with economy; how far they gave the greatest and best force; how far they interfered with each other; how far they counteracted the. general means i of recruiting; and how far they were the basis of a permanent force, First, as to the volunteers: this was a. head of defence which had already undergone so much discussion, that he wished he could pass over it without saying any thing now, But he could not help saying, that all his former opinions were confirmed by
<image src="S1V0003P0I0312"/>
<col>595</col>
the additional experience he had had since be expressed them. They were further confirmed by the testimonies of the best authorities; and here he hoped it would be hardly necessary for him to say, that he meant not the slightest reflection on those who composed the volunteer corps, who were ready to do any thing that was pointed out to them;. who had taken great trouble to do what they were directed to do, under this system, and if they had not done what was best, it was not their faults. The volunteer system had many defects in every view, political, civil, and military. If the volunteers were designed to answer a sudden emergency, it was a misfortune that they were not left to accomplish their natural purpose in their natural state. He could not help thinking that some things had already taken place, which might be considered as indices of what would probably take place in consequence of the prolonged existence of the volunteer system. The country had not yet seen the volunteers, either under the circumstances of a general election, or a general scarcity With respect to the second point, that was by far of more consequence. He considered the volunteer system as altering the civil character of the people of the country. As to the civil character, he apprehended a general effect on the manners and habits of men, such as would be much to be lamented. It tended to disturb the general relations of civil life, to fill those who belonged to it with vain and extravagant pretensions, to bring down the high and to exalt the low. Though he was far from wishing for a revival of those aristocratic notions which induced men of high rank to look down on others with disdain, yet he was a friend to that respect which belonged to persons in the several ranks and gradations of life. History had a story of a prince who had a man to go before him, to remind him that be was a man, lest he should forget he was one; and many political writers thought it a great advantage in our constitution, that our popular elections brought the great occasionally to sue to the humble, But extreme distinctions were not the vice of the present time. The vice was, if any thing, the other way. The toe of the peasant came too near the heel of the courtier. When committees of volunteers had the power of giving votes of praise and censure to those of the highest ranks, he thought a door was opened for much injury to society in a quarter where it was least apprehended. There was not a people in the world dis-
<col>596</col>
posed to shew more respect to the superior classes than the people of England; he meant a dignified respect, having nothing slavish in it, a homage to imputed virtues. If these virtues were not equal to the credit given them, the fault was in those who were supposed to possess them, and the respect that was shewn on the belief of their existence, was not less honourable to those who paid it hen. as to the effect of the volunteer force on the army; he did not think it could be the object of any considerable degree of confidence. If some battalions were equal to regular soldiers, and others were not so, it would be impossible to know when they were to be depended upon and when they were not. It was like those books of travels in which truth and falsehood were so-mixed, it was impossible to distinguish what was true. To those who argued that the volunteers were better materials of defence, disciplined as they were, he answered so was a pistol a more effectual weapon than a bludgeon, but if the lock was out of order and the powder bad, the bludgeon was unquestionably better. It was; absurd to suppose, that putting men in red coats and grenadiers caps, was sufficient to make an army. We were told every day of the volunteers being so well trained, of their dressing, marching, exercising, man&#x0153;uvring, and looking in every respect like regular soldiers; but that was not enough to make them regular soldiers. Nothing was more like a man than a picture; yet it was not a man. He had heard of a celebrated painter who painted grapes so well, that the birds came and pecked them, but they found they were not grapes. It was not the right way to judge of things by appearances. So to judge was to view with the eye of a child, that mistook painted devils for real ones. It was impossible to make an army out of a painted army, or what merely looked like an army. It was not men that made an army, but discipline. Discipline was the very life and soul of an army. You might as well suppose, that flour and eggs and butter and plums, would make a plum-pudding, as that men alone would make an army. The action of the fire and water was necessary to make, the excellent production to which he had alluded; just so the action of discipline and subordination was necessary to the constitution of an army. He had read in a well-known weekly publication (Political Register, Vol. 7. p. 193) a. letter which the writer had done him the honour to address to him from Edinburgh
<image src="S1V0003P0I0313"/>
<col>597</col>
abounding in true philosophy and plain sense, professing to be a summary of those opinions which himself and others, his friends, entertained on the subject of our national defence; but the letter stated these matters in a style superior to what he could aspire at compassing. He thought it worthy the perusal of every gentleman who heard him. If the volunteer force had, in the first instance, been only intended as a manifestation of the public feeling, that service had already been performed. A system built on zeal alone, was not built for perpetuity. It was like a fine theatrical position, which could not be preserved beyond a certain moment, and if the curtain did not drop, the arms must fall. The men would fall back into their natural station. By bounties and threats an effort may be made to draw them forth into battalions. The government may shake their parchments at them to drive them back again into these battalions, as it had done at first to drive them forward. A bill may be passed to render the volunteers more voluntary, and to make them permanent they may be constituted into a little militia. It was said, in accounting for the thinness of the musters, that those who absented themselves from drill had learned all that was necessary. Those who were most diligent, being of course soonest perfected, if they absented themselves as soon as complete, those who remained, in their absence must be a mere aukward squad; and when all were completed, there would be none in attendance. There were certainly some-things, such as swimming, which if once, learned were never forgot; military discipline was not of that number, it required continued exercise to preserve it. From these considerations, he could not agree that the volunteer system had done any great good; or that it was calculated to do any; but least of all, that it was to be looked up to as a part of our military establishment. Next as to the Militia, which he would describe in two words, by allowing that it was as good a force as it could possibly be, and that it went far beyond the designs and expectations that were formed of it at its institution. It had attained the highest perfection it could possibly reach, but the vicious principle of the ballot on which it was founded, had the most pernicious effects on the means of supplying our general military system. There were but two ways of supplying an army, by voluntary services and by compulsion. The armies of
<col>598</col>
most other countries, he believed, in some measure, of all, were how supplied be compulsion. France recruited her armies by conscription, he believed, not to the exclusion of volunteers; old France, he believed, recruited entirely by volunteer service; Russia recruited by compulsion; so did Sweden; Denmark in a great degree; Prussia altogether; and Austria chiefly by means not very remote from these; Britain raised its forces by volunteers alone, with the exception, of the train bands. The consideration of a bounty of one guinea, or a guinea and a half, could not have presented any inducement. The inducement was the state and condition of a soldier, and the bounty served only to wet the bargain. Here the right hon. gent. traced the history of the militia, from its institution in 1756, from the impulse of shame, at having Hessians and Hanoverians brought into the country to defend it. This was considered as a cheap force which would lie by in time of peace, and go to grass till it was wanted. Thus, being a force of a mixed description, it lost the advantages of both those between which it was intended as a mean. Our foreign and our home defence were intimately connected. The loss of its greatness would be to this country equivalent to the loss of its existence, for when it ceased to be great it would cease to be at all. There could be therefore no question of the legitimacy of the right of calling for and enforcing personal service, if there was a necessity of calling for it. It was not necessary, however, to have recourse to compulsion, and it was not legitimate as we could do without it. There were other measures more constitutional and more consistent with our former practice, which there was still room to hope might be successful. Such was the system that had existed before the ballot had been introduced, a poison that had of late spread so widely and been so destructive. This poison had long lain dormant. There was a spirit in the lower orders of the people, which would not for a time suffer the ballot to be enforced. From 1756 to 1774, the beginning of the American war, the ballot had never once been enforced, but in this period there was certainly included nine years of peace, from 1763 to 1774. At that time, there was no system of substitution, no bounties, growing out of it. From that time the increase of bounties commenced. The govt. was before the only bidder in the recruiting market, and
<image src="S1V0003P0I0314"/>
<col>599</col>
the recruit took the condition of a soldier, with a guinea to make it a wet bargain. Then the limit of time and of space in the obligation to find a substitute in one's own district, when the price was increased to govt. all over the country, in so much that ten guineas were given in the American war. Then a remedy was adopted similar to that which our farriers applied to horses legs, till the Veterinary College taught us better, giving temporary relief, but causing the complaint to relapse with increased force. Thus our state farriers, when the amount of the militia rendered the regular recruiting so dear, expected to relieve us by giving us more militia. In 1772 officers were threatened to be dismissed the service if they gave so much as two guineas bounty. In 1782,after its vast rise in the American war, it was again reduced to 3&#x00BD;, and the whole of that was not given in money. In the following war, when the militia was formed as it were into a regular army, and few served, who were not substitutes, the bounties became enormously high. Then came the pernicious system of raising men for rank, by which men who were only cornets, and even men who had never been in the army, were made colonels. In raising men the bounties had been brought to such an excess that it was necessary to threaten with dismissal those who gave more than 15 guineas. Then the Scotch and Irish militia were instituted and the latter was carried to the amount of 28,000. Next came the supplementary militia, and afterwards the provisional cavalry. This last was a thing of so short a duration, that it had slipped his memory at first, but it had left effects not to be forgotten. It passed over the country like a blight. It was like a hustle at a fair, which one got through in a moment, and did not think of it afterwards, till he found he had lost his watch. It was a pleasant conceit, to make every man ride another man's horse, till at length, when the men and horses were all brought together, no man knew how to mount, and so they all separated. From the effects of all these proceedings, the bounty was raised to 60 or 70, or even 80 guineas, and there was no reliance for an adequate and permanent supply after all. Then the establishment of the militia and army of reserve to the amount of 140,000 men, entirely choked the regular and ordinary sources. It was an hon. colonel who was now absent, (Colonel Craufurd), and other gentlemen at that side of the house, who had given its
<col>600</col>
beneficial qualities to this Army of Reserve. Act, so that whatever effect it had came from that side of the house, and he at his friends might say, like critic Dennis, "that is my thunder." Thus he had traced the mischief down from the American war. The ballot was a principle which must of necessity exhaust itself, and it must have been exhausted where a measure which was calculated to produce 50,000 men, could by no possibility be made to produce more than 37,000. Applying it further was like giving physic to a man whose stomach would not hold it, and who immediately vomited it off. The ministers who had acted upon it till it stopped, were not, however to be blamed. They had only tried a known and established principle as far as it could go,. Having made the peace of Amiens, having suffered Bonaparte to overrun the Continent, and having made war when this' country could be nothing but a besieged island, that minister had recourse to this measure as the bow of Ulysses, which he made such use of that Adam Bell, and the other celebrated archers of old, were nothing to him. At length the force was so spent, that nothing more could be done, and as soon as this great archer fired the arrow, it fell at his feet. The friends of the noble lord (Sidmouth), t however, cried <i>victoria.</i> They did not consider it, in the language of the turf, as a race won by a neck, though it seemed it was neck or nothing with him. The rider was thrown, and the horse came in. The noble lord called upon the clerk of the course to give judgment for him; but the person who held the stakes was called upon to give them into his hands; and having in the mean time been given into other hands, with a view to a different system, the noble lord now demanded them back, and was not satisfied to have them by halves.&#x2014;Here the right hon. gent, gave many forcible illustrations of the absurdity of recruiting the army by the circuitous means of the army of reserve. The army of reserve supplied many recruits, because it absorbed all the men of the country, and, the additional bounties induced men to go the circuitous route into the army. To praise it on this account was just the same as if, because all the members of the house came into it through the lobby, it should be said, what a wonderful place this lobby is, which supplies the house with all its members. It was a kind of turnpike where soldiers did not pay, but were paid for passing
<image src="S1V0003P0I0315"/>
<col>601</col>
through it. A man would be thought rather foolish not to go into the lobby first, by which he was able to get a double bounty before he became a regular soldier. He hoped to hear no more of the good effects of this lobby. The whole system was encumbered and weighed down with a complication of machinery. The existing bill was a sort of great digester, supplied with almost innumerable small capillary tubes, one running to every parish in the kingdom. Why not have a large straight pipe, making a direct communication at once, and free from the confusion of useless intricacies? But then he should be told, oh, there is no invention, no contrivance in all that! It was much easier, in those gentlemen's eyes, to take a circuitous mode of filling the great machine, than to throw all the materials into it at once, in a straight forward way. Gentlemen had talked about the bill not being oppressive; the oppression was not upon the recruit, but it was pretty heavy upon the parish. The parish was to do the work, after the old saying: "fire burn stick, stick beat dog," and so on. The parish officers over whom the parish had no controul, were to raise the men or levy the money from the parish; but that could no more have the effect of finding the men, than one could make the horse drink though he should take him to the water. It was, however, now given up. It was like a man of whom nobody spoke well, and of whom therefore it was unnecessary to speak ill. It was like harlequin's horse, which had but one fault, and that was, that it was dead. It, was perhaps, unnecessary to follow it further, unless, indeed, the humane society may not have yet done with it, and the right lion. gent. opposite may hope to revive it by some process. If, however, the right hon. gent, would content himself with saying merely that it deserved to be revived, he would be satisfied. It was said the present measure (the additional force act), had not been successful, because the parish officers did not understand it so as to proceed to enforce it immediately. If it lay six weeks in their hands before they could understand it, much could not be expected from their sense of their duty under it. The bill passed on the 23d of June, and nothing was heard of it till the 13th of Aug. and then when it was supposed to be ready to go off like a spinning jenny, like the machinery of a thousand looms, not a sound was heard; it was <i>altum silentium.</i> In-
<col>602</col>
stead of all this, you went about as quietly as ever, and people in their disappointment were every where enquiring, "where's the new parish bill?" Wonderful, indeed, were the effects of this parish bill, that was to work with such unprecedented local efficacy, and which had produced, allowing for casualties and desertions, the astonishing number of 665 men! Yet this was the system which was immediately to produce all we wanted, and to afford a continued and full supply to 60 battalions. In what situation was the country, when the ballot failed altogether, and when no hope could be entertained of the measures brought forward to replace it? It was not only a present supply that we wanted, but the means of constantly keeping up that supply; 5000 men was the whole number obtained by the staff recruiting. The rest was obtained from sources reprobated, not as unproductive, but as unfit to have recourse to, as exhausting the permanent, hope like the savage who cut down the tree to get at the fruit. To pursue this system further, was to act like a man living on credit, and going on smoothly for a while, but who was obliged to shut his door as soon as the bills came in for payment. When were we to go back to the ballot? the gentleman who had tried it last had stuck to it while it could produce any thing; and now it was like a fallen minister, in company with whom nobody wished to be seen. The present measure had gone far beyond the ballot, except that the parish officers were not compelled to act, as it was not determined how we should proceed. They could not get the men, and ministers were afraid to take the money. It may perhaps be resolved to take it from two or three parishes, to quicken the others, by whipping them, just as the captain of a ship compelled the dropsical man to mount the mast, saying his complaint was but arising from indolence, till the fall of the poor man into the sea convinced him of the truth of his sickness by the loss of his life. Another complaint against this mode of recruiting was, that while it professed to keep the bounty below 201. the crimps who were generally employed, had the. 141. allowed by government, in addition to the 20l. making altogether 34l. for every man. Thus ingenuity came at length in aid of the parish officers, and obtained some men at an increased bounty. He therefore considered the experiment as haying completely failed; and here he might say, what he
<image src="S1V0003P0I0316"/>
<col>603</col>
was sure the house would be glad to hear, that his task was nearly at an end. He had shewn, that as a means of improving cur military system, this measure was abortive. In nine months an increase of 11,000 had beep made. In the same period the losses at home and abroad amounted to 16,000. Both these making 27,000 ought, and must have been supplied by other means, if these had not been resorted to. And if, on the whole, the increase had been equal to both these 15 or 16,000, it would have been for the consumption alone, all the rest would be derived from foreign sources. Thus it appeared, that only 5000 men had been gained for the general service in the first instance, and the remainder of the increase by measures which the hon. gent. had reprobated, so that only one-third of the increase had been supplied by the means that had been employed. Some small addition had been made to the cavalry, but when it was considered how favourite a service that was, the supply was by no means such as it ought to be under proper encouragement. If the troops employed on colonial service, which were all set fast to answer the local demands, and could not be detached, except, perhaps, en small expeditions, for no man could suppose that the troops in garrison at Gibraltar, &amp;c. would be safely employed in that way, all the regular infantry we had to dispose of, amounted only to 53,000 men; and, indeed, if we took off the amount of foreigners, we should find it to be only 47,000 British infantry. This was all we had for any important and unexpected demand whatever, whether it were at home, or for any effort in any great continental operation that might be undertaken. As for the Foreign troops, it was, doubtless, very proper to have them in our pay; but one could not help being struck a little with the character of these foreign troops. Soldiers of this description were generally supposed to be for general and unlimited service, ready to go any where. But a greater part of them were Canadian Fencibies, and New Brunswick fencibles. The house would, however, think it odd that in these foreign corps were included 4 or 5,000 native troops of Ceylon, armed, he supposed, with bows and arrows, From what he had stated, it would be evident, that something more than the present measures was necessary to fill the' vast vacancy in the army, and after having shewn what
<col>604</col>
were our military prospects, he was satisfied that every body would agree in the necessity of resorting to the wisdom parliament, for that something that was necessary to be done. In saying that it would be right to resort to the wisdom of parliament, no man, of course, could be supposed to mean his own wisdom; but the more he felt himself incapable, and the more he looked to others, as more competent to point out the measures that ought to be adopted, the more necessary it was to resort to the wisdom of parliament, and of the nation. As, however, in the event of his motion being agreed to, he should feel it his duty to submit his sentiments on the subject in the committee which it was his intention to propose, he thought it would not be altogether out of place to stats summarily the particular objects to which his observations would apply. And here he begged to disclaim all systems, his object being only to remove the obstructions which at present interfered with the regular supply of the army, and to restore our military establishment to the old way of recruiting it. He had already shewn from experience the ruinous effects of the system of ballot, that had first created, and afterwards continued, the difficulties in keeping up the numbers of the army; and he was confident that the fault was with the government. Wherever difficulties and impediments were felt in any branch of the public service, it was a priori to be inferred, that the fault lay with the government. He was aware, however, that no minister could, as had been boasted by Pompey the Great, raiset in army by stamping his foot on the floor. The creation of an army would be a work of time. He was not, however, one of those who were apt to run into the opinion, that every thing that was wrong must result from the fault of government. The question might be divided into two parts, with respect to an army within our power to have, and out of our power to have. For any purpose that we wanted, he was happy to think, that an army was completely in our own power. An army-might undoubtedly be carried too far, as well as neglected too much, and not carried far enough; but what was there to hinder us, with our population, from making a proper army? What was to prevent us from turning a certain proportion of our population towards the military profession, as well as towards any other of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0317"/>
<col>605</col>
the professions, or any particular trade? Why could not the army be made to feel that it was equally worth their while to go to that profession, as to go to a trade? Make it an object with men to enter into the profession, and enough will be induced to join it, Suppose any new manufacture of great importance, some great cotton manufacture for instance, suddenly sprung up and flourished; some other trades and manufactures were probably at first hurt by its prosperity; but these things found their own level. There was a new means of subsistence discovered. Mr. Mai thus had not, indeed, discovered any new principle, for the principle was obvious before; but he had pursued it with great perspicuity and truth. The demand will have its relation to the supply. For instance, if shoes took twice their quantity of materials, if men had four legs instead of two, or even supposing they had as many legs as a caterpillar, shoes must still be worn; what was there then in the trade of a soldier so exceedingly forbidding and revolting to the people of this country? A soldier was not quite sure of a very long life, but his occupation was more healthy than most others. People were found everyday to go down into damp, unhealthy mines in Cornwall and Derbyshire; we had painters, and other tradesmen following unhealthy pursuits; nothing was wanting but to put the soldier's trade upon a proper level. The army had great attractions to the young and ardent and high-spirited. Notwithstanding all seeming disadvantages, there was an invincible attachment to a military life to be found, by no means uncommon. But when he spoke of the trade, he might also speak of the trader. The military life was the trade; the trader was the government. Could not this great trader do as much as other traders do, to put this particular trade on as high a ground at least as any other of the profitable pursuits of mankind? Could government fear any competition on such a subject? They could grant privileges, they could bestow immunities, they could confer distinctions. We know very well that in some other countries the force of certain religious opinions have been such as would either entirely prevent or else impair the formation of an army. Thus, in some parts of Asia there were people that could not be brought to military pursuits. So the numerous body of Quakers (could not be persuaded to throw off their religious opi-
<col>606</col>
nions on this point. We find no such prejudices operating generally among us; but would any body say, that we were become so unmartial and so effeminate as to be past the age of military glory, in the history of this country? Why were our ships manned without fear of storms, or wrecks, or enemies? If we had not an army it was entirely our own fault. Ministers had sometimes laid the fault of bad systems upon the heads of their predecessors; but what excuse of this kind could be made where a minister had been his own predecessor?&#x2014;Now, the first thing he should propose, would unquestionably be to clear away all the obstructions that stood in the way of getting an army. To the system of ballot he certainly objected, though he would not at once do it totally away in the case of the militia. He had been misrepresented as the enemy of the militia, which he had never been. He did not like to see it extended too far beyond the original object, and clogging the regular army. He considered the manner in which the militia was broken in upon some years back, as the most injurious mode of meddling with that establishment, and as one which could only be justified by an immediate emergency. Some gentlemen who held commissions in the militia, fancied they had the militia under the protection of the chancellor of exchequer; but he would tell them, that they had put their lamb under the butcher's protection; and, if they pleased, he would tell the militia colonels how long it would be safe. It would be safe just as long as they themselves had power and numbers enough in parliament to protect it. &#x2014;The right hon. gent. then dwelt at considerable length on the improper profusion of military honours. Military distinctions, he said, were scattered about over the land, with a profuse and in discriminating liberality. He here again referred to the letter from Edinburgh, addressed to him, and published, which contained some excellent observations on this head, written too, in a part of the island, where he had good reason to believe the volunteers were the most perfect. It was odd, that while all other, characteristic honours are sparingly diffused and cherily kept, and whils they sustained their importance by their rarity they should be so profuse and unbounded in their relations to a profession which, is most particular about its honour and its glory and which seeks, 'the bubble reputation, e'en in the cannon's mouth.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0318"/>
<col>607</col>
Why should there be this strange, and seemingly unaccountable difference? Did gentlemen imagine that the estimation of any other honour would long hold its place if treated with any thing like such indifference? Independently of the impolicy of thus making common the military rank, he would put it to the feelings of gentlemen, whether it was treating military men with any degree of fairness, to lessen the value of that which formed the most grateful reward of a soldier's ambition, and enabled him to support the greatest variety of fatigue and danger? From the very nature of man, such a conduct must have an ill effect. By taking away the importance of the military distinction, all the -association of glorious and animating ideas connected with it were likely to be lost, and the public as well as the individual deference attached to it must soon disappear. Many other distinctions might be mere nullities. A man might be advanced to the peerage without any Claim to merit. Certainly the possession of a title of that nature did not imply any: but the military distinction was of intrinsic value, particularly because it implied intrinsic merit. If, said the right hon. gent. you destroy the peculiarity of the symbol, you take away the fairest portion of its value. If you, by your indiscriminate use of a distinction, take from the soldier the fruit of what he has earned by a life of military activity and the arduous exertions of a long and well-fought field, you must, beyond calculation, destroy the spirit of an army, and that high-minded ardour of military life, which has so justly been called the "cheap defence of nations." Now, sir, in this, as in other matter, I say, go back to simplicity in your theory and practice. Get rid of the incumbrances and obstructions of your system. Clear away all the brush-wood, and brambles, and moss, and ivy, and let the tree have the full benefit of the air and the light of heaven.&#x2014;That was what it wanted to invigorate its growth, and without that it could not prosper. We required an army for our defence, not a thing decked out in gaudy trappings that was merely an army to look at. To acquire such an army, nobody could say that much was not to be done, and nobody would say that much ought not to be done. In order to attain these objects, and to procure men, he would propose, as the most essential improvement, an alteration in the time of service. That improvement adopt-
<col>608</col>
ed, there were various other regulations which he would take occasion to submit, and particularly one with respect to the condition of the inferior officers of the army, whose pay was at present extremely inadequate. This was a point that, in a country like ours, where money was in a great degree the criterion of consequence, was highly deserving the attention of the house. It was notoriously impossible for military officers of inferior rank to subsist upon their present allowance. How, then, could the military character sustain itself and be held in proper estimation, if military men were driven, as too many of them unfortunately were, to all the shifts consequent upon poverty; if they were, as was frequently the case, driven from the army altogether, to perish in a jail? That such consequences must have a most injurious effect upon the army, he thought could not be doubted for a moment; and the causes of the evil must be removed, before an efficient army could be had. If it was desired to raise and maintain an army, it was peculiarly necessary to raise the pay of the inferior officers, so as to enable them to maintain themselves like gentlemen. How galling must it be to them, to see themselves surrounded with holiday soldiers, who could afford all the enjoyments of life, and who outshine them in military splendor.&#x2014;The next improvement he would recommend would be a formal, solid, and absolute renunciation of the practice of drafting. This practice he had ever deemed improper and mischievous, and a great aggravation of the other evils which existed in the military system. By abolishing the draft, and changing the term of service, he sincerely believed that two of the most serious objections which the people felt against enlisting into the regular army would be done away. If this mode of recruiting was adopted, he thought the country would never want real soldiers, and therefore would not be reduced to the necessity of placing much dependance on any other. He would also suggest some regulations relative to our force in the West India Islands. The horror felt respecting that service would be set aside in part by the abolition of the draft, and of course one of the great obstructions to recruiting would be removed. It was well known that, among the common people and the soldiery, nothing excited more dread than the idea of a draft to the West Indies; for it was not the men going
<image src="S1V0003P0I0319"/>
<col>609</col>
to share danger with their officers, but going without their officers, and the mischief was to that place. which they deemed "the bourne from whence no traveller returns." &#x2014;Into a detail of the regulations which he thought necessary with respect to our West India service he did not feel it proper to enter. He should merely say, that such European troops as it might be expedient to send to those colonies, he would not send without a gradual preparation for the climate. This preparation to take place by transferring the men in a sort of succession from one spot more congenial to the constitutions of Europeans to one less so. For instance, he would first send them to the island of Bermudas, or the Bahamas, and having remained there some time, they might be safely conveyed in rotation to those islands where the climate was wanner. The advantage of this arrangement, as the house must conceive, would be to fit the men to endure that climate, which had been heretofore so great a drain on our population. This drain he always understood to be aggravated by the practices to which the drafts generally resorted on their arrival in the islands. If they did not suffer from the common effects of the climate, they either fell victims to despair, or got into habits of intoxication which speedily produced their death. This furnished another reason for the abolition of drafting, and the adoption of the plan of preparation lie had sketched to the house.&#x2014;Another head of reform which the right hon. gent. strongly felt it his duty to bring forward, would be the abolition pf corporal punishment, unless for acknowledged and specified crimes. Such punishments, he agreed with the correspondent he before alluded to, were by much too frequent and, too severe in the army. There were many means of correcting a soldier without resorting to them. Any offence that shame, fine, or imprisonment was adequate to punish, ought not to be the subject of corporal punishment. So much severity as was known to prevail was the more to be deplored, because it, was not necessary to the preservation of discipline. Discipline, if it be properly managed, will, like a machine well contrived and set together, move on with the less force. It is generally owing to some great fault in the original structure, or some great mismanagement and unsteadiness, in those to whom the machine of discipline is committed, that these excessive severities are at all
<col>610</col>
had recourse to. The reform which was so desirable on this point could not, he was aware, be effected, without a material change in the construction and conduct of courts martial. They must be more solemn in their proceedings, more deliberate in their investigations, something must be contrived to intervene in all cases between, passion and its effects; some check on summary punishment must be provided; it must be settled that no corporal punishment shall take place, no sentence of that nature shall be executed, without previously submitting the proceedings of the court martial to the review of the commander in chief. This last provision would, he was persuaded, have prodigious effect, particularly if combined with, a specific description of the crimes for which a soldier should be subject to corporal punishment. To such a description he could not conceive that any objection could be made. Certainly on the score of justice and humanity, it was much fairer that such a description should be promulgated, for the government of both officer and soldier, than that the latter should be left entirely to the mercy of whatever conception of crime the former might happen to entertain. He cared not how voluminous, this description of crimes might be, all he wanted was, that the soldier might know what was really to be deemed criminal. The penal code of this country, although death was almost in every line, did not terrify the great mass of the people, because it referred to such crimes as no proper man would commit; nor would a precise description of the crimes to which corporal punishment should attach in the army, have the effect of preventing men from entering into or remaining in it; but quite the contrary.&#x2014;The soldier will not be afraid of that which no good soldier will deserve: but it would certainly be a considerable alleviation to a soldier's mind to be always able to say, "If I go to parade with a button off my coat, or happen to be a minute or two too late, I shall not be in danger of being tried by a court martial, or of suffering any immediate punishment that is degrading to the feelings and spirit of a soldier." It was in these small intermediate points of duty, that were of but little consequence in themselves comparatively speaking, that he thought punishments might be modified, and alleviated, with the greatest and happiest effect.&#x2014;He then adverted to certain, in-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0320"/>
<col>611</col>
centives, which he thought might be applied with considerable propriety and effect, in stimulating soldiers to a keener and more active sense of their duty. The profession of a soldier was such as exposed him to the most imminent danger, and he who had any apprehension of that, was not fit for the profession, nor should ever think of entering into it. He allowed, that, circumstanced as this country now is, it is impossible to increase the pay of the army; in that respect, we had unfortunately arrived at the <i>ne plus ultra.</i> But was there nothing else, he asked, could be found worthy to be substituted as an equivalent to an additional 5d. or 6d. a day? was there no such thing as contriving to put by part of the bounty, to be paid on the expiration of the service, instead of the beginning, as a stimulus to the valuable and true soldier, and to operate as a reward to his family, in case any accident should happen to him. The bounty, he said, generally acted both ways, and he feared there was not above one man in eight, or at most in seven, that really deserved it. But there were other things, which operated as incentives, as powerfully, or perhaps more so, than money. Suppose we should give him a right to vote in particular cases, or even suppose we should go still further, and allow him to kill game, for instance, as a stimulus to be a true soldier, and thereby deserve preferment; suppose a serjeaut should be allowed to kill game? This would be no unprecedented method of holding forth inducements independent of pay. In France the soldier was always, during the ancient govt. entitled to a particular row in the theatre. Was it not to be supposed, he asked, that such grants or remunerations as those he had mentioned, would operate in this country as they had done in others, and not only be a means of drawing men into the army, but of making them good and attentive to their duty, while, they were in it? For his own part, he could not entertain the most distant doubt of it.&#x2014;It now remained only for him to touch as briefly as possible on the several objections which might, perhaps, be made to these different alterations and points of reform, which he had taken the liberty to suggest to the house, as applicable to the present state of the forces, and the peculiar circumstances of the country at the present moment. One of those was that this change will require time,
<col>612</col>
and that at present we have none to spare. This was an old argument, he said, but it weighed very little with him. In order to act as we ought to do, we must boldly look our situation in the face. If bad measures were allowed to go on because the time was too pressing to consider of their removal, the time would at length become pressing, because the measures were bad. We should be found, according to this argument, to be in the same situation with the hare that is hard pressed by the greyhound; she must go on because she has not time to turn, and yet in turning lies her only safety, for if she persists in going forward, she is sure to fall a sacrifice. Such, said the right hon. gent, will precisely be the situation of this country, if we blindly and obstinately persist in pursuing the same measures as have led us into our present unfortunate circumstances. Can any one, he asked, pretend to flatter himself that the danger we had to dread is over, and has passed away? Me cautioned the house to beware how they suffered themselves to be deluded by such an idea. If, therefore, that should be allowed, and it should be granted that it was still hanging over us, then he contended, there was no time like the present; we had not a moment to lose, and, our greatest safety lay in looking the danger boldly in the face, and endeavouring to avert it by an immediate adoption of measures different to those which had been proved to be so imbecile in themselves, and so totally contrary to the ends and purposes for which they had originally been intended.&#x2014;The right hon. gent, again repeated his opinion, that without changing the term of military service, the army would never become so efficient as was to be wished. It was the general sentiment, the growing feeling of the country, that to enlist for a term of years would be far preferable to the present unlimited period of enlistment. Against adopting this plan, indeed, he had never heard any rational objection. He had heard something of authority, but nothing at all of argument. No argument could, he contended, be drawn against this project from the limited experiment which was alleged to have been made. In order to ascertain the efficacy of this plan, it must at once be rendered general. There were some things which ought to. be proceeded in progressively; one iron might be hot while the other was cold; but the plan he now proposed was not at that description
<image src="S1V0003P0I0321"/>
<col>613</col>
it must not be executed slowly or partially, it must be promptly and universally set in motion, or it was one of those things in which the fire would go out, and the iron grow cold. If in addition to this change, that of abolishing the draft were acceded to, he should entertain the best prospect of the speedy advancement of the army. On the abolition of the draft, he would advise the grafting of another regulation, namely, that men who after serving the first term, suppose seven years, would agree to enlist again, should have some marked additional privilege. To those who observed that the limitation of time he mentioned would have an injurious effect on discipline, he should only think it necessary to say, that as a soldier was liable to punishment if he committed a fault only the moment before his time of service expired, he could not conceive that such an effect was possible. If, however, suclvan effect were likely to arise, how happened it to our Army of Reserve and our Militia? It was to be observed, too, that very good discipline prevailed in the armies of Austria and Prussia, among whom enlistment for a term of years was universal. By what contrivance then could men be seduced? By what artifice could they be duped to attend to the notion that this term of enlistment would induce desertion? A contrary consequence was, in his judgment, to be looked for; but if a man should desert, let him be obliged to serve for two of the ordinary terms, or during his life. From some officers who had travelled in Germany, he understood that it was extremely difficult to persuade the soldiery to desert, because, as they said, the term of their enlistment was soon to expire. Why should not a. similar reflection produce a similar unwillingness to desert among the soldiers of this country, if the same plan of enlistment were adopted? The parish bill, he was persuaded, would have gone on better, if this term of enlistment had been promulgated, because the influence of the gentry would have been more cheerfully employed to induce men to enlist, if they had been aware that the men were only to serve for a limited time.&#x2014;That reasons could be urged against the propriety of considering of some means to augment our regular army, which was the object of his motion, he was and a loss to imagine. It was confessed, that all the ordinary means of recruiting were at a stop, and that the
<col>614</col>
parish bill had failed. With this confession before the house, how could, resistance to the motion he had to submit be justified? He recommended the adoption of a few plain principles, which must tend to increase the consequence and comforts, and of course the numbers of the army. Several expedients had been tried, and all, including the parish bill, had notoriously failed. He trusted that all gentlemen who had these failures in their recollection, would join with him in endeavouring to devise the means of rescuing the army from that ill-judged and mischievous system in which it was involved by those who had had the management of it for the last 30 years. Now that necessity so imperiously called for the revision of this system, he hoped that it would not be objected to.&#x2014;With respect to the foreign corps in our service, in the present state of the country he approved of the existence of that body, and if we could combine with it a strong disposable force of our own troops, he thought we should not be obliged long to withdraw ourselves from the continent, nor to shut ourselves up like a, tortoise in its shell. This shutting ourselves up so long, he considered one of our greatest misfortunes. He hoped we should hear no more of the fantastical doctrine that "we were a people too honest for continental connections." We had appeared to withdraw ourselves so much from even the feelings of the continent, that Europe might fairly say, that while we were engaged in our commercial pursuits and in collecting wealth, we were offering them money to fight for us. As he considered the state of our army to be that which had placed us in that situation, and that the increase and improvement of our army could alone bring us out of it, and that no time was to be lost in struggling to effect our release, he felt it his duty to move, "That it be referred to a, committee to revise the several acts passed during the two last sessions of parliament, for the Defence of the Country, and to consider of such other measures as may be necessary to make that defence more complete and permanent." On the question, being put,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01369"><member>Mr. Canning</member><membercontribution> said, however be might differ from the arguments and sentiments; that had been stated by his right hon. friend, he did not differ with him as to the grounds upon which he proposed the motion that had been just submitted to the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0322"/>
<col>615</col>
house. In adverting to those arguments, he should abstain from having recourse to those common places which his right hon. friend had deprecated; as he should not be disposed to dispute the propriety of the measure he proposed for a parliamentary inquiry, if the case existed which he supposed, either that government had not done any thing, or very little for the defence of the country, and the improvement of its military means. In those principles he agreed; he only differed in the application. Before he should proceed, however, it was necessary to set himself light with his right hon. friend, because of the indignation and astonishment which he supposed him prepared to feel, on finding any person declare himself an advocate for the bill of last session. He was prepared to justify that measure, though he should not contend that it had succeeded to the full extent that had been expected; but this was not the proper time to pronounce to what degree it had failed. He begged to remind his right hon. friend that the bill had two objects, one to raise a large present force, and the other to become the source of a permanent supply for the army. This latter object had not yet been tried, and until that should be done, it could not be fairly decided that the measure had failed. The latter object was by much the most important one, and that which had induced many gentlemen. who felt dissatisfied with some of the details of the measure, to agree to it. That part of it which related to the permanent force had not yet been tried, the measure having had its operation hitherto confined to raising the immediate force, and filling up those vacancies which previously existed. What then did he infer from this? That they should try the merits of the measure, not from its effect in the first case, but on its success with respect to the more important object. The operation of the bill commenced with filling up existing vacancies in districts that had been before ex-exhausted of means by the army of reserve and the militia, and, because it had not succeeded in such districts, he contended that it was not fair to conclude that it had failed in its diffusive operation all over the kingdom. He did not insist on this as a conclusive argument, but he looked upon it as a sufficient one against those who dwelt on the total and general failure of the measure. It had been urged that it neither had succeeded in filling up the va-
<col>616</col>
cancies, not in procuring a permanent supply for the army; but he should refer gentlemen to the effect of the measure which this had succeeded, and in whose place it stood, he meant the army of reserve, and they would find that it had yielded 10,000 men this year for the army. Did that prove that the hope of a supply from such a measure was visionary, and ought to be abandoned? Were there not other reasons also to shew that it ought not to be given up? When they looked to the circumstances of the country, exhausted of men by the army of reserve and the supplementary militia, there could be no surprise felt at this measure not having had immediate and complete success. There was another difficulty to its operation which had arisen from the opposition that had been made to the measure last session, and the report that an effort would be made to obtain the repeal of it early in the present. These circumstances had thrown a damp in a great measure on the zeal that would have been exerted in carrying provisions into effect, which might afterwards turn out to be nugatory. But it was not alone in this general principle that exertions were slackened, but experience also concurred to the same end. In execution of the army of reserve act, penalties had been incurred for deficiencies which had not been levied, and the parishes might have had an expectation of escaping in the same manner. Here there was an example of penalties incurred and not exacted, and the expectation of the repeal of the measure, though he could not allow the expectation to have been just; and he would ask any man, whether, with such expectations, there had been a fair chance for obtaining that exercise of zeal, of local influence, and personal exertion, whether the measure had had a fair trial, and whether the country did not require the defeat of the motion submitted that night, in order to give the measure a fair and impartial trial? Another reason his right hon. friend had assigned in support of his motion, was founded on the variety of opinions that had been stated in the different discussions on this subject in that house. Undoubtedly the public looked with considerable interest to the discussions in that house, and to the opinions urged in them, and to none with more respect than to those of his right hon. friend. But it was rather curious to make the number of va
<image src="S1V0003P0I0323"/>
<col>617</col>
rious opinions and various measures that had originated in that house, an argument for repealing this measure, in order to shew that they had come to some steady and consistent system at last. If the measure were even less unexceptionable than it really is, and not as likely to answer the end for which it was intended as he maintained it was, he insisted, that instead of repealing it, it ought to have a fair trial, and not precipitately, or prematurely, receive its condemnation. With respect to the merits of the bill, it appeared to him calculated to produce an effect which his right hon. friend had frequently dwelt on during last session, and had that night more particularly and directly adverted to. Let the army alone, said his right hon. friend, and it will get on. His right hon. friend would not deny that this measure had the merit of doing away the high bounties, of doing away the competition, especially as since the failure of the unhappy parish officers the men had been recruited by the regular officers of the crown. But his right hon. friend was hot to be satisfied with any mode of recruiting, unless it was conducted all in one way and for one description of force, for until he had reached nearly the end of his speech, the only inference that could be drawn from all the preceding points of it, was, that he would allow of no species of force but regulars. In the close of his speech however, he seemed to have kept one remnant for the militia. Had he not found to what purpose his right hon. friend had turned this concession by the appeal he bad made to the feelings of the militia colonels, he should have given him credit for an honourable and praiseworthy attachment to that constitutional force. Mad his right hon. friend recommended the extinction of the militia force, he could not have had the opportunity for his powerful appeal to the militia colonels; but in proposing to continue the militia on its original establishment of 40,000, and to raise that number still by the ballot, he seemed by his appeal to the colonels to have made his statement from his conclusions, not his conclusions from his statement. As to the argument of his right hon. friend, with respect to the policy of such a mixed force as that proposed to be raised by the bill, it appeared weak in principle, inconclusive in reasoning, and dangerous in tendency. If on the conclusion of war, our regular force were to be reduced to the
<col>618</col>
peace establishment, which alone the constitution of this free country could have sanctioned, he would ask his right hon. friend, how we were, on the breaking out of a fresh war, to raise such a force, as he was sure his right hon. friend would be as anxious to have as any other member of that house, a force capable of being employed with effect for the annoyance of the enemy? What alternative was there to chuse, but whether a large standing army should be kept up, or a force of the description of that proposed to be raised by this bill? Neither the country nor the house would consent to the former; and in proof of this, he could refer to those arguments that had been so frequently repeated in that house, of the danger of having the liberties and the constitution of the country subverted, by having a large standing army at the disposal of government. There was no alternative, therefore, but to obtain a force that might take the place of the army without offence to the constitution. Of such a force there were two descriptions: the militia, of which we had the experience of half a century, or such a force as should be limited in service like the militia, but being officered by regular officers should approach more nearly to the quality of regulars, and be a nursery for the supply of the army. He agreed that the militia ought not to be carried beyond a certain extent, not because it could not be kept up to that extent, but because it was ascertained, that it could not be maintained in that extent consistently with the principles of its original institution. If you vary from the original mode with respect to officers, you may vary still more, so as to render the force more perfect, and to bring it nearer to the discipline and condition of a regular force, which would be the same as a standing army.&#x2014;But his right hon. friend, after stating his objections to the bill, had proceeded to detail fairly the alterations and the improvements in the military system, which he proposed to submit to the committee. His leading principle of objection was to the variety of force on foot; but he could not himself-see on the face of it what objection there could be to variety. If a pure monarchy were to exist in any country with a population purely agricultural, unmixed with commercial pursuits, there would be no difficulty in obtaining a large army, augmentable and, reducible in a short pe-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0324"/>
<col>619</col>
riod. But the same does not take place in a country where manufactures and commerce have made extensive progress. Did it follow, he asked, that if we should not get the whole number we wanted in the way most desirable, that we should throw the remainder away as dross or useless? Did it follow, that because the whole number could not be procured of that description for which his right hon. friend had a great fondness and anxiety, that we should not march such a proportion of our population who might enter into the disposable force, whose absence would not be felt nor lamented, and leave the protection of their districts to those who remained in the more limited force. If the militia could be carried to the extent necessary, then his right hon. friend would obtain his object. But they had tried the militia, and had found it impossible to keep it to the extent to which it had been carried, consistently with the principles of its institution. Was there any thing absurd, surprising, or mischievous, in the arrangement for employing men whose occupations prevented them from engaging in the disposable force at home, and thereby setting free so much of the disposable force to be employed abroad? A great objection to this levy was, that it professed to raise the men first for limited service, and afterwards to leave them free to enter into the regulars. But if he understood right what his right hon. friend had urged, when the army of reserve act was under consideration, he had recommended to allow the men to enlist from it into the line. For himself he could not discover what the absurdity was in supposing that the men would be induced to enter for unlimited service in the first instance; and that afterwards, from the force of acquired habits, the influence of example, and attachment to their officers, they might be induced to take the second step. His right hon. friend had argued, that a limitation of time would operate as a strong temptation to them to enter even for general service, but was- not there equal reason to suppose, that a limitation of place would also operate as a temptation? He could not conceive why the first limitation should act as a direct temptation, and the other in the inverse ratio. If either was to have any effect, both combined must have a greater, for it could not be supposed that both together should fail when one was irresistible. With respect to the limitation
<col>620</col>
of the time of service, there were many different opinions; and he should not venture to hazard any, though he could not but admit, that it was a subject which would be productive of many difficulties in the detail in the committee. Any body might see that a great variety of difficulties would occur. If the change were to be made in time of war, and the condition to be extended to all at present serving, would not the offer be a boon to one, whilst it would be a mischief or a punishment to another? But should they begin from the present moment, how were they to proceed? were the new levies to be in corporated with the old battalions? what a source of disquietude, heart burnings, and dissatisfaction? were they to be disposed of in separate battalions? then they would come to the present bill, and do that precisely which it professed.&#x2014;He bad no hesitation in saying that the idea of a colonial army met his approbation, without exception even of the black corps. But any body who looked to the population of the colonies must perceive that it was impossible there to supply the army, and it would therefore be necessary to recruit in Europe. Mark the consequences of restricting the army from service in her colonies. Would the other powers of Europe follow the example? Supposing the army of St. Domingo to attack Jamaica, would it be wise to tie up the disposable force of this country in Europe, and suffer one of the most valuable of its possessions to be destroyed? As to the other parts of his right hon. friend's speech, without any intention of disrespect to him, he did not think them of much importance. Among the suggestions of his right hon. friend there were some, which among an enthusiastic and romantic people, might be very well received; but he would put it to the candour of his right hon. friend, whether if instead of the bill of last session it had been proposed by ministers, as an encouragement to enlisting, that soldiers, should have a box at the play, or serjeants should be allowed to shoot partridges, that right hon. gent, would have been inclined to treat the proposition as serious. If there was any thing like a contrary disposition on the part of ministers not to manifest a readiness to do every thing in their power for the national defence, or if there was any thing imminently dangerous in our situation, that called for the committee moved for by his right hon.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0325"/>
<col>621</col>
friend, then, indeed, there would be some I which we at present stood, and compared ground for acceding to it: but the case it with that of last year, to refrain from was quite otherwise. Perhaps it might be for the satisfaction of the house to slate a view of the whole military force of the country. The total of disposable force on the 1st of Jan. 1804, was 143,251; on the 1st of Jan. 1805, 154,660; the whole of our limited force on the former date, 27,890, on the latter, 20,747. Deducting the limited force, which was included in the former aggregates, the whole of the disposable force was, on the 1st of Jan. 1804, 115,000; on the 1st of Jan. 1805, 135,000, making an increase of disposable force of from 18,000 to 20,000 men. The quantity I procured by recruiting was from 24 to 26,000; and 15,000 since the operation of the present bill. The total of between 11 and 12,000 increase, is not only in the unlimited force, but in the destination of the army at home. This circumstance was sufficient shew the bill had not been idle and nugatory. Thus, 12,000 men were now ready to be ordered in any direction, in addition to the force provided; besides this, we had the essential improvement in the volunteers, which he could not agree to consider unconnected with the question on the extent of the military power of the country: their number now ascended to 300,000 men, who have stood the test of time, who have resisted the temptations to ease and indolence; and 160,000 of this vast body have been reported fit for service. He did not mean they were adequate to contend with the troops of Prussia or Austria, but that they were competent to the defence of such districts of the island as should be committed to their protection. Could we with such a force have any room for the gloomy representations frequently made? Could more be expected from the nature and extent of the population of the country? If we wish for a criterion by which to estimate the military force of the country, let us look to the state of the different powers on the continent, let us look particularly to France, which, with a population of 35 millions, had an army not exceeding at any time 5 or 600,000 men, while in G. Britain, which contained but 15 millions, the regular force amounted to three hundred thousand men, besides those to v whom the domestic defence was entrusted, as also 70,000 militia, and 300,000 volunteers. It was impossible for any men who fairly examined the situation in
<col>622</col>
which we at present stood, and compared it with that at last year, to refrain from allowing that it was greatly improved. Could such a man be found, he would ask him, was it nothing to have added, as we had clone, to the strength of those fleets whose peculiar province it was to protect us from the execution of the menaces of the invader? Was it nothing to have succeeded so completely in the blockade of the enemy's flotilla, that instead of venturing on the ocean to attack us, it was with difficulty that it could be slily moved along the coast from one part to another? What would the enemy have said, had we acted in the manner they hare done? Had we in the first instance, prepared an extensive armament for the express and avowed purpose of invading their shores, then allowed it to be insulted at least, if not injured, by the assaults of hostile squadrons, and concluded by sending a flag of truce to the very parties to whom we had denounced destruction. With what exultation would they have then exclaimed, "such were your threats, and such has been your execution!" With regard to many of the suggestions which his right hon. friend had thrown out relative to the improvement of the state of the army, he had only to lament, and this he did with the utmost sincerity, that he had not the advantage of official situation to put them into practice; he was convinced that government would hear with attention, and adopt with anxiety any of those suggestions, the propriety of which was obvious. He must repeat what be had said on the measure, which was the object of his right hon. friend's motion. The principle of that measure could not be said to have failed, for only the first part. of it had been put into execution, the last yet remained to be executed. The two parts were perfectly distinct; the on was comparatively torpid and insensible; the other active and vigorous. It would; be a strange, and surely a very contradictory mode of proving to the country the stability of our councils, to abandon a plan to which we had not yet given a fair trial; this would rather be an was nothing of fluctuation and uncertainty: If what he had asserted was tree, if there was nothing in the present situation of out affairs that of could justify in us either precipitation or despondency, but if, on the contray, the measure under consideration contained it the seeds of a permanent system, which
<image src="S1V0003P0I0326"/>
<col>623</col>
would ultimately put us in possession of a disposable force greater than any one we had yet had at our command, he then thought his right hon. friend had not made but a case sufficiently strong to induce the house to go into the committee lie required.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01370"><member>Mr. Windham</member><membercontribution> rose to explain. He did not mean to imply the army should be excused from the service in the West Indies; he intended only to intimate that much of the peril of that duty might be avoided by some salutary regulations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01371"><member>Sir William Young</member><membercontribution> rose in reply, and animadverting on the assertion of the right hon. gent. who spoke last, that no care was made out to justify the house in adopting the motion of his right hon. friend, proceeded to shew, that a case was made out, and that it required attention only to the documents before parliament, to put that case in a clear and strong light, and which no declamation or sophistry could overshadow and obscure. If, said the hon. baronet, in December 1803, parliament voted a very considerable augmentation of military force, under a general sense of the danger and exigencies of the country, and the necessity of going far beyond an army suited merely to defence; if that vote has not been given effect; if a total failure of increasing our infantry of the line has occurred; and if even the British regular infantry have decreased in numbers from Jan. 1804 to Jan. 1805, surely such failure, to be attributed only to the inefficiency of the measures adopted by parliament, or to neglect or incapacity of executive ministers to give their measures effect, constitutes a case for enquiry, and for going into a committee (as proposed) for a revision of the laws passed with a view to military levies, and of the exertions and measures adopted by ministers for the like purpose.&#x2014;By the returns on the table, the total army, exclusive of militia, was in Jan. 1804, 143,251 men. Under strong impressions of; the nature and magnitude of the contest in which we were engaged, and with a view to active warfare, and offensive operations, loudly called for by every statesman, nay, by every man in the country who had a sense of the, true interests, honour, or Very safety of the British dominion, parliament in Dec. 9, 1803, voted an army of 191,099 men, being an addition of 47,848 men to the then effective force.&#x2014;Under law as such as have passed, measures such
<col>624</col>
as have been adopted, and ministers such as have succeeded, has the augmentation voted been acquired? Have the views and injunctions of parliament been accomplished? and if not, is there not a case for revision and enquiry? The right hon. gent. on the other side of the. house, has stated an increase of army within the year of 11,409 men. This is admitted, (but subject to observation on what that increase, consists of and whence it has arisen); but taking it as stated, it leaves a deficit in the augmentation voted in Dec. 1803, for the year 1804, of no less than 36,339 men. The total of army in Jan. 1804 was 143,251; the total in Jan. 1805, 154,660, being an increase of 11,409 men. But in this period, (comprized in the above totals,)

exceeding the total increase of army and therefore leaving to account of decrease in British infantry to such amount of 852 men, notwithstanding 105S infantry raised for rank, and 4297 raised in Scotland and Ireland on similar, or even worse and more destructive terms of levy, and so much is in further proof of a total failure of proper measures for recruiting the line.&#x2014;Looking to establishing the fact of this failure, as ground for a committee of revision and inquiry, he would further observe, that whilst the cavalry encreased only 4046;. 4658 cavalry were in the same period raised for rank; strongly implying that even this favourite branch of service could not sustain its number by ordinary recruiting. But, says the right hon. gent, we have had nearly 7000 men from the army of reserve enlist for general service, and taking these with the 11,000 augmented, we have 18,000 men, disposable force more than we had last year. In this the fallacy is obvious and to be detected, by merely recurring to the nature of the services recruited. Among the foreign troops are 5,401 native Ceylon troops a disposable force? Are 1,018 Canadians and Halifax fencibles a. disposable force? In fact, 6,818 enlisted from limited, for general service, is the only addition, and looking to Great

<col>625</col>
Britain and Ireland for a disposable force, as here only it can be looked for, our disposable infantry of all description is 53,6ll; perhaps not more than required, on eventual and possible attack, in G. Britain, Ireland, Guernsey, and Jersey, as a regular army to give example to, lead, and conduct, the mass of new levies, militia, and volunteers, throughout the country, has the vote, then, of Dec. 1803, been in any way accomplished? And should we not inquire why it has not been accomplished? Or is the sense of danger past, and the opinion of parliament altered? Certainly not. Late as Jan. 1805 the house has voted for 1805, an army of 22S.234, being (the effective army at the time 154,600) an augmentation of 73,634, doubling in number the existing deficiency. Shall we, for this great and necessary augmentation, depend wholly on measures that have failed, and even without inquiry into how or why they have failed? Or can we trust this additional force bill, so completely as it has been proved inefficient? The right hon. the Chancellor of the Exchequer has, indeed, suggested the further measure of applying to the British militia for 22,586 volunteers, reducing the militia establishment for England to 40,000; for Scotland, to 8000. But, supposing all these volunteers to be acquired, our disciplined defensive force is so much lessened, and what is gained, cannot be called wholly a disposable force; whilst the numbers, if taken on the most sanguine muster, are but a small part indeed of the augmentation voted, under the expressed opinions of the necessary force for adventuring in the war, voted by parliament, according to the sentiments regarding that extent of army, and a disposable force, as delivered by every man who can be called a statesman, on whatever side of the house. Surely the total failure of accomplishment hitherto, and little promise from the same, measures, therefore in future, constitute the strongest case for inquiry and revision of what has been done, what not done, and consideration of what should be done. &#x2014;The hon. baronet concluded with some observations on the state and condition of our army in the West Indies, and from a scene he had been witness to himself, particularly approved the suggestion of his right hon. friend the mover, for abolishing the draft from militia regiments in the West Indies, which left those who had weathered the climate, forlorn and hope-

<title>[CONDUCT OF SIR HOME POPHAM.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01374"><member>Sir William Burroughs</member><membercontribution> osberved, that the papers laid on the table relative to the conduct of an hon. baronet, who commanded the Red Sea squadron, rendered it necessary that other papers should be produced. He therefore moved, "that a copy of the examination before the commissioners of naval enquiry, relative to the management of the squadron in the Red Sea, under Sir Home Popham, should be laid on the table."</membercontribution></p>
<col>628</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01375"><member>Sir Charles Pole</member><membercontribution> did not see the smallest objection to this paper; but, as it was certainly a motion of a novel nature, he thought that some previous notice ought to have been given.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01376"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> concurred in the propriety of giving notice. He understood now that an examination of the case had taken place before the commissioners of Naval Enquiry, respecting the conduct of sir Home Popham. He was well pleased that this was the case, and undoubtedly it was of importance that every paper that could throw any light on this affair should be produced. At the same time, it was not usual to move for a paper of this nature; but, as the hon. baronet, who was a member of the commission, had no objection, it might, with the greatest propriety, be received.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01377"><member>Mr. Canning</member><membercontribution> observed, that the essential reason for the motion was this: it had been said in the house, that the commissioners, when directed to investigate this affair by the Admiralty, returned for answer, that it was not a matter within their province, but was rather a subject for a court martial. The hon. baronet (sir Charles Pole) had then omitted to state, through inadvertency, he had no doubt, that the commissioners had, however, proceeded with the investigation. Now it did happen, that we had the testimony of one Lewis, a most material witness, who could not, however, be heard at the bar of the house. It was necessary that we should, in this case, have the best possible evidence. It was fortunate that this man was brought forward as an evidence, as they had travelled out of their way to investigate this affair. He begged leave, therefore, to follow up the notice just now given by some other notices. He would move for the date of the paper containing the directions of the Admiralty or Navy Board, to the commissioners for proceeding in this affair; the date of the reference of the case back again to the Admiralty or Navy Board, by the commissioners; together with a copy of any answer made by the commissioners of naval enquiry to any communication from the Admiralty.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01378"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> said, that if the right hon gent. had any charge to bring against the commissioners of naval inquiry, he had no doubt it would be fully met.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01379"><member>Sir Charles Pole</member><membercontribution> observed, that he had never stated that the commissioners of naval inquiry bad refused to proceed with
<image src="S1V0003P0I0329"/>
<col>629</col>
the case, but merely said, that it was his private opinion that this was a case more fit for a court martial. It was extraordinary that he should have been misrepresented, since something passed at the time which shewed that he was not then generally misunderstood. The notices were then fixed for Tuesday.</membercontribution></p>

The members of opposition in the house, appeared to wish that the second reading might either be deferred, or debated then. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was not in the house. At length, after several short conferences across the table,</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01381"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> rose. He said, that the public business ought not to be made to wait for any member of that house. He certainly would not wait. He should move the order of the day.&#x2014;The order of the day for the second reading of the Horse Duty bill was then read, upon, which the hon. gent, observed, that he did not wish to determine the course of the public business. What he thought was, that it would he highly improper in the house to suffer the business of the public to wait for any man.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01382"><member>Sir Robert Buxton</member><membercontribution> said, that there were some amendments intended to be made in the bill; and therefore thought that; the order ought to be postponed to Tuesday next.&#x2014;This was agreed to and the house adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01395"><member>Sir W. Burroughs</member><membercontribution> objected to the word "apprehended." He thought it was too hurtful to the feelings, and should therefore prefer "taken up," or any other expression.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01396"><member>Admiral Markham</member><membercontribution> contended, that as Bartholomew never was discharged from the service at the time he left it, he could not be considered as a man impressed. He therefore must be of opinion that "apprehended" was the most proper word to be made use of in this instance. The orders sent to sir Home Popham were to turn over all the officers of the Romney. Why he did not do so remained for him to shew.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01397"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> said, he had no wish to make use of any word that might be unnecessarily hurtful to the feelings of any person; but the whole of the enquiry might be objected to on much the same grounds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01398"><member>Mr. Sturges Bourne</member><membercontribution> said, that some circumstances relating to Mr. Bartholomew, made part of the defence, of sir Home Popham before the admiralty and that house.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01399"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> observed, with respect to the objection to the word he had used, that Bartholomew did actually belong to the navy at the time he had absented himself from service; that notwithstanding the order to sir Home Popham, he was on shore, and on this being heard and considered, the lieutenant of the press-gang took him, and carried him back to the service to which he belonged.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01400"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, there could be no doubt of the fact, that Bartholomew was taken by the press-gang. Would it not therefore be the better way to use those words in describing a fact which came the nearest to the transaction itself? Why not say, "taken by a press-gang and carried to the Nore".</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01401"><member>Sir Home Popham</member><membercontribution> said, that he had, no

<col>637</col>
doubt, received an order to turn over his whole crew; but yet that he permitted the other midshipmen, as well as Mr. Bartholomew, to go home to their friends; and that many of them had since returned to the naval service, while others had gone into the army. He mentioned this fact, in order to shew that he shewed no particular partiality to Mr. Bartholomew, in anticipation of his name being brought before that house, which was a thing of which he at that time did not dream. In discharging Mr. Bartholomew and the other midshipmen, he had to observe, that he consulted the commissioner of the pay-office, to whose judgment it was the custom of naval officers to appeal upon paying off a ship. The hon. officer, with reference to the word "apprehended," remarked, that it could only be applicable in the case of Mr. Bartholomew being a deserter. That that gentleman was not so considered, either before or since his being impressed, he thought it unnecessary to say more than this, that previous to his being impressed, Mr. Bartholomew corresponded with lord St. Vincent, and if he had been deemed a deserter, it was fair to presume, that his letter would not have been answered by the admiralty, and after Mr. Bartholomew's being impressed, he was taken on board the Zealand, from which he was transferred to the Inflexible. No proceedings had ever been taken with respect to this gentleman, and he was now a lieutenant on board the Inflexible. This ship, it was known, was under the command of a friend and relation of lord St. Vincent; and he would put it to the house, whether it was probable that Mr. Bartholomew could hold such a rank on board, had he been considered guilty of desertion? Whether the usage of the navy bore him out in the original discharge of Mr. Bartholomew and the other midshipmen, was not now the question; but he submitted to the candid consideration of the house, that as Mr. Bartholomew was not in fairness to be deemed, and he had not, in fact, been treated as a deserter, so the word "apprehended," which implied that, was not applicable to him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01402"><member>Admiral Markham</member><membercontribution> said, that according to the speech of the hon. baronet, it would be thought Mr. Bartholomew was some young gentleman known to many members of that house, instead of what he appeared to be on entering the service, a landsman and afterwards becoming an able

bodied seaman.&#x2014; Here the Speaker interferred, and observed, that the discussion was extending to a length that did not fairly arise out of the question before the house.&#x2014; The motion, after the omission of the word "apprehended", and the insersertion of the words, "taken by a press-gang", was agreed to.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01403"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> presented a petition from Wm. Mitchell, Esq. capt. of his majesty's ship the Zealand. The petitioner complained of certain false statements and misrepresentations contained in letters from, and an affidavit by, David Ewing Bartholomew, which lies on the table of the house, in which the said Bartholomew charges petitioner with ill-treating him while on board the Zealand, in consequence, as Bartholomew stated, of his being known to be a witness in favour of sir Home Popham. Petitioner therefore prayed, that an order should be made, that copies of the letters and affidavit which he had addressed to the secretary of the admiralty, in reference to allegations of Bartholomew's affidavit, should be laid before the house; and also that he, the petitioner, should be furnished with Copies of the letters and affidavit of Bartholomew. Petitioner further prayed, that he might be called to the bar of the house, to answer the charges against him, and that the house would afford him such opportunity of vindicating his honour, as to its judgment should seem meet. The petition was ordered to lie on the table, and orders were made, on the motion of Mr. Grey, for the papers referred to in the said petition. On the motion of Mr. W, Dickenson, a copy was ordered to be laid before the house of the certificate of Mr. Bartholomew having passed his examination for a lieutenancy; also, a copy of the muster roll of the Enterprize relative to the taking of Mr. Bartholomew by a press-gang</membercontribution></p>

than death, he would propose, first, that the right of administering oaths, should be extended to regimental courts martial, as well as to general courts martial, and also that some provision should be made to prevent any other than officers of some military experience, from being at all on courts martial. This was a provision which he was aware was already strictly attended to in some regiments. But it was highly desirable to render it general, and with that view he would move that none but officers of a certain age should be put on courts martial, and that the president of a court martial should in no case be under 21 years of age. This regulation he thought necessary, although persons under that age might, in some cases, be competent from military experience, to act as members of courts martial. To those points the right hon. gent, felt it his duty to call the attention of the house and he had no doubt, that should they meet the concurrence of the right hon. mover of the bill they would be productive of the best effects upon the discipline and feelings of the army.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[SLAVE TRADE.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01410"><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member><membercontribution> rose to move the second reading of the bill for the abolition of the slave trade. The hon. member stated, that the measure had been so often discussed, the sense of parliament had been so frequently taken upon it, and that house had so decidedly expressed its opinion upon the subject in the course of the last sessions, he felt it unnecessary to trespass upon the attention of the house on the present occasion, but reserved to himself the right of replying to any arguments that might be advanced against the motion he had the honour to submit.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01411"><member>The Speaker</member><membercontribution> observed, that according to the custom of the house, none but a member originating a new motion, had the right of general reply to any objections made against it, and therefore the hon. gent, possessed no such right.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01412"><member>General Gascoyne</member><membercontribution> could not let the question go by without giving his opinion upon it once more. The hon. mover had said, that no new reason bad occurred since last session against the adoption of this measure. He should, however, rely upon the wisdom and upon the feelings of the house, upon a. measure so interesting and so important to the interests of this country, to our revenues, and even to our existence as a nation. He trusted the house would not consider any former pledge of this
<col>642</col>
kind as binding upon them now. There were two points of view in which he considered this question; first, as to the policy of the abolition altogether; and secondly, as to the time in which it is now proposed to abolish it, a time so arduous and so critical as the present. First then, he supposed the hon. mover to have great confidence in the measure, but that he now found himself absolutely deficient in the sources of those appeals to the feelings of the house, which he was wont to use on former occasions. He seemed to have nothing new to urge on the score of humanity and benevolence; nothing to say about the cruelty and oppression of the trade, and the inefficacy of all regulations concerning it. No; if he had, he would not have suffered the house to be without them to-night. Since the last regulations were passed, not a solitary instance of their violation could the hon. gent, produce. The surgeons' bounties too had been claimed, he believed, in seven cases out of teu. The house were not called upon now to act from any particular circumstance He believed there was not a member who did not know, that if we abandoned this trade, it would go into other hands. He could prove, that at present there were five American vessels taking in a proper cargo, in order to enable them to carry on the trade to a greater extent. He could wish that evidence and counsel might be heard at the bar of the house; but he hoped the wisdom and justice of the house would render that unnecessary. Did any man consider this as a mere abstract question? No: it Was impossible; every one must see this that its ultimate object was emancipation, and nothing could be more dangerous to our colonial system, than a discussion which involved such a question. Much had been said upon a former occasion about the claims which the Africans had upon out humanity; but he would ask, what claims the native Africans had either upon out justice or humanity? If they had forfeited all claim to the protection of their own laws, what claim had they to the protection of ours? He was entitled to ask this, because there was now no charge made Of kidnapping innocent persons. The principal houses in the trade had established storehouses upon the coast of Africa, where the negroes were collected in considerable in numbers. That; an importation of negroes was necessary to our colonies,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0336"/>
<col>643</col>
there existed no doubt in his mind, nor could any suppose that the population of the West Indies was sufficient for the purposes for which it was wanted; and, supposing the abolition to take place, the only immediate consequence would be an increase of labour to the slaves upon the islands. Upon the ground of the policy of the abolition, he had heard no argument whatever in its favour, and certainly since, the regulations had been acted upon, it was neither politic, nor expedient. Was it upon the speculations of a few individuals that we were to give up our colonial system, or was this the time, at the moment when we were engaged in an expensive war, which was likely to be of no ordinary duration, to try the effect of speculative opinions; was this the time to move such a question when we had seen the effect which had been produced by similar opinions in a neighbouring isle to our colonies, and when it must be evident to every one what extreme danger would be produced by the spreading of such a spirit in the West Indies? Was not the West Indies a favourite object with Bonaparte, and would he not eagerly seize the advantage which our agreeing to the abolition of the slave trade would throw into his hands? This was evident from his recent conduct. It was, however, of the highest importance that they should consider the extreme danger of holding out speculative opinions to the Blacks, whose co-operation would be pregnant to this country with every possible mischief. He could not avoid considering it as a remarkable circumstance, that, notwithstanding this question of abolition was brought forward, government had contracted for 5000 slaves, who were destined for military services; a contract too which would not expire till February next. Such a measure seemed to hold out that one might buy a slave for a military use, but not for a civil use. He agreed in the propriety of having corps of black troops in our service in our Colonial possessions, but when it was proposed to abolish the slave trade altogether, such a measure was certainly inconsistent with the object of the abolition, He would now ask if the result of the abolition (supposing it to be carried, which he hoped it would not) should be such as had been predicted by those best informed upon the subject, namely, nothing less than the abolition of our colonial system, should we in that case be so
<col>644</col>
well able to cope with our enemies, bereft of the vast resources which we derived from our colonies, and would not every man in the country, and every member of that house, be called upon to pay his share of this large deficiency, which such a defalcation would cause? Let the house consider the number of men who were employed in consequence of this trade, and the benefits which resulted from it to our manufactures. Besides, how could those who formed an opinion here upon the subject be better judges than the planters themselves? But it was said that some of the planters agreed to the propriety of the abolition. This might be the case, but it should be recollected, that the abolition would throw the property and concerns of our colonies into the hands of those who had large capitals, for such only could support it; and therefore the concurrence of some of those was rather an argument against the abolition. But, whatever might be the opinion of a few of the planters, the house of Assembly of Jamaica, the Representatives of the Island had declared themselves decidedly adverse to the measure of the abolition. Much had been said of the danger of increasing the number of slaves; when that number was compared with the number of Europeans, it certainly appeared very great, and there was no question that if they were united, no military force could put them down, as they might reckon upon the proportion of about thirty negroes to one European. How impolitic, then, was it to raise doubts and questions in their minds upon the subject of emancipation, for to that this question ultimately led, and how pregnant with danger was such conduct to our colonial interests and possessions, particularly at the present moment, when, from the circumstances of a neighbouring island, the Negroes had not only greater inclination to unite, but possessed greater facilities of co-operation. Under these circumstances, it became the house to say at once to the world, that they were resolved not to adopt a system which could only lead to the most injurious consequences, and thus to put an end to discussions which had already, and which evidently must have the very worst effect upon the minds of the negroes. He had some objections to the provisions of the bill, which he should reserve until it went into the committee; at present he should confine himself to objecting to the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0337"/>
<col>645</col>
principles of the bill, and he was confident that there were many members who formerly voted for the abolition, who would now, under the circumstances in which we were placed, vote against the present bill; he should therefore take the sense of the house upon the subject, lie concluded by moving "that the bill be read a second time this day six months."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01413"><member>Mr. C. Brooke</member><membercontribution> said, if the abolition of the slave trade was rendered general by the consent of all those powers who had colonial possessions, he did not know that our colonies would suffer so much as those of other powers, from the superior resources which we possessed, and the high state of cultivation in which these colonies were. But the policy of France and Spain led these powers to continue this trade. During the phrenzy of the revolution in France, the slave trade was abolished, and that measure led to all those horrors which had since occurred in St. Domingo. After the peace, however, or rather the truce of Amiens, one of the first acts of the consular authority was to re-establish the slave trade; and not only this, but every encouragement was given to the subjects of France; bounties were granted upon the importation of slaves, and every facility was established which could promote the increase of the trade. Such was the policy of France at that time, and such continued to be the policy of France at the present moment. This being the case, what would be the effect of our abolishing the trade, but only to throw it into the hands of other nations. If we abolished the trade, it would not be the means of compelling those vessels which were at present engaged in it to give it up; they might, and many of them, no doubt, would continue it under the sanction of other powers. During the short period of the last peace every encouragement was given to British subjects engaged in this trade, to go to France with their vessels; they were allowed to navigate their own vessels with only the regulation of having a nominal French commander, and being engaged to take a number of French apprentices. This evinced the value which was set upon the trade by France, and the same encouragements would, doubtless, be held out in the event of another peace. Spain also gave every facility to the trade; but she was prevented from turning it much to advantage by the want of a commercial navy. She was only prevented, however,
<col>646</col>
by her inability from participating in the advantages of the trade. If parliament should agree to abolish this trade, what advantage would result from the measure? would there be one slave less? He considered the bill as a measure which would deprive us of the means of increasing the benefits resulting from our colonies; and he should therefore support the motion for postponing the bill for six months.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01414"><member>Sir William Young.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;Sir; in treating of this important question, the hon. mover' has contented himself with saying, that there is nothing new in it. Though we are now engaged in agitating a point which, materially concerns the British empire, though the ruin or salvation of one of its most valuable component parts may depend on the success or the failure of this project of his, he has had the boldness to say, that there is no occasion to hear the arguments of counsel on this subject! There is nothing new, he observes, and therefore he thinks that neither he nor any body else need say any thing about the matter; and, acting upon this opinion, he has given in his negative to calling in the counsel. Nothing new, sir! Has nothing new happened in the situation of St. Domingo? Have the hon. gent. and his friends entirely neglected to turn their attention to the interesting lesson which this island affords? Have they attended to the consequences that have resulted from the measures of emancipation pursued by a set of Jacobins in a moment of political phrenzy? If they have not attended to these things, what are we to think of their preparations for the discussion and management of an affair of this nature? If they have attended to them, can they produce any satisfactory evidence to shew that the same consequences which flowed from the Jacobin excesses, will not follow a similar decree of the British senate, supposing that we should have profited so little by the experience of France, and our own observation, as to pass such a decree? Is there nothing new in the situation of Jamaica? Has the hon. gent, seen the report of the assembly, or did he think it worth his while to read it? The assembly of that Island are so impressed with the pernicious, and absolutely ruinous consequences of this measure, that they have sent a confidential agent to this country, in order to resist, by every means in their power, its progress. When the interests of such faithful subjects of the British em-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0338"/>
<col>647</col>
pire are concerned, when their whole is at stake, that whole from which they have been ever ready to contribute a part to the exigencies and service of the state, when you are proposing to plunge them into difficulties unknown to any other class of British subjects, and perhaps into utter ruin, is it possible that any man can be so callous to the feelings of justice, to a sense of that attention that is due to British subjects, as to say that these men ought not to be heard in their own defence? This, sir, is treating an important part of the empire with the most marked disrespect. What are they to conclude with regard to the attention paid to their interests, when a member of the British legislature, on an occasion like the present, does not chuse to say a word respecting their complaints? Their consequence to this country in every point of view, certainly entitles them to more respectful treatment. The hon. gent. has only thought it necessary to advert to the precedent of last session, in order to justify his silence. That precedent, sir makes very little in his favour. When we consider the circumstances under which the measure passed this house last session, we shall find that he has no claim to rest much upon that. The attendance, it is notorious, was very thin, and since gentlemen have begun to attend more minutely to all the circumstances of the case, we are not yet without hopes of stopping this bill in its progress through the house. Scarcely 150 Members were present at the discussions last session, and at no one stage of the business were the members above 200. This may be regarded, in some measure, as a presumptive proof, that gentlemen had not made up their minds en the subject. Am I then to be told now, that the precedent of last year is a sufficient reason for the passing of the bill at this time without further examination into its nature and merits? It is a very lame reason indeed, and one which I trust will have very little weight with the house. I hope that the other 458 who have not as yet come forward, will now take a share Mi the matter, and consider the question in a broad and comprehensive point of View and not suffer their judgments to be misled by idle declamation, and vain speculation. I hope that they will attend to all the interests of all the parties concerned in the present instance, and study the means of most effectually promoting them. Without this, sir, it may happen
<col>648</col>
that while they think they are pursuing a course pointed out by humanity and justice, they will at last find, when it is too late, that they were doing the highest injustice to the one party, without benefitting the other.&#x2014;Having said so much, sir, on this point, I shall proceed to consider the affair more closely. But I could not refrain from saying what I have already thrown out, after the singular line of conduct which has been adopted by the hon. gent. It may be said, sir, that little weight is to be attached to my opinion on this question, because I have a personal interest in the failure of the measure. I Confess, indeed, that I have such an interest, but I am not on this account in a singular situation, nor is it unusual on other questions for members to take apart in discussions where they themselves are particularly concerned, and to have their opinions canvassed with attention. In almost every public measure, some are more concerned than others. But so far are their opinions from being treated with neglect, that they are justly considered as entitled to a fairer scrutiny than those of others, who in the nature of things cannot be supposed to be so well acquainted with the subject. This, sir, ought to be the case in the present instance. Though I am personally concerned, yet my experience entitles me to speak with more confidence than those who cannot be supposed to be so well informed on this particular question. The government of a country has not a right to deal partially and unjustly by a single individual. This, is a principle that has been recognised, and an attention to private justice has often prevented public wrong. If this, sir, be correct, I trust there is no reason why I should not be heard with attention, and have my opinions considered with the same degreee of candour and impartiality, as has been shewn to other persons in similar situations. That a great part of the members of this house have not been present during the discussions of last year has been said already. But the Irish members who have not sat long in this house, have not had an opportunity of attending to the discussions on this question from the beginning. It may not, therefore, be altogether unnecessary. What are we doing in this case? Are we doing justice to those, who are more immediately concerned in the business? It is in vain for you to think of abolishing the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0339"/>
<col>649</col>
trade. This you cannot do. Transports will pass from island to island, and the trade must be carried on by foreigners, if not by us. It is in vain, therefore, to say, that in this respect, even the negroes themselves can be much benefitted. On the contrary, they may be much injured. But there is another argument which has been used by the hon. gent. He has often adverted to the desolate state of the coasts of Africa compared with the interior of that country. The population of the coast, he has said, is almost ruined, while that of the interior is in the most flourishing condition. On that subject, our means of knowledge are very confined. I, therefore, can know but very little about it. But all, however, that I do know, is from Mungo Park. What does he say? He says that the very reverse is the fact of the case. When he and his companions penetrated into Africa, they found that a general system of war was carried on in the interior. This was exemplified in the case of the war between Abdulkader, king of Foota Zorra, and Famel, king of the Jalofs. The former sent a messenger to the latter, requiring him to embrace the Mahomedan faith. He presented two knives as the emblem of his mission: "with this knife, (said he) Abdulkader will condescend to shave the head of Famel if he will condescend to embrace the Mahomedan faith, and with this other knife he will cut the throat of Famel, if he does not embrace it;&#x2014;take your choice." Famel, however, chose neither to have his head shaved, nor his throat cut, and a war was the consequence. Did those who complained of the treatment of the slaves in the West Indies, attend to the account given of their situation in their own country, as related by Mungo Park? The Jalonkas, as he informs us, are much more cruel to their slaves than the Colonists are, and he gives a shocking instance in the case of Nealee, a female slave. We have, it on the testimony of Sir George Young, that all the freemen in the interior pf Africa are obliged to learn the use of arms. This, undoubtedly, is a proof of the constant warfare in which they are engaged, especially when it is considered that there every feud is hereditary, and that quarrels are handed down from father to son as a family possession. The wars of the Africans are personal, and are therefore carried on with much more rancour than any thing which is known among
<col>650</col>
us and other civilised nations. This appeared from the history of the wars of the kings of Bambouhe and Bambarra. Mr. Park said that the interior of the kingdoms were populous, while the borders were not, on account of the constant wars that prevailed among themselves. It is also to be recollected, that Mr. Parke's journey to Africa had nothing to do with the subject of the slave trade, but was undertaken for scientific purposes, under the direction of Sir Joseph Banks, to whom the British public owe so much, and whose merits are so well known, and so universally admitted. Mr. Park mentions that in one of the wars when nine hundred captives were taken, only seventy of these were freemen. The feelings of the Mahometans, with respect to the other Africans, might be collected from a cursory story told by the above traveller. When be proposed to go to Tombocto he was advised by a friendly native not to go there. The reason was, that he had been there once; the master of the first house into which he entered had said, if you are a Musselman enter into my house as my guest: if you are a Caffre, I instantly seize you as my slave. Few slaves come from the, coast, they are generally taken from the interior. Gardiner, who belonged to the establishment at Sierra Leone, confirms this. Our African traveller when he sailed up the Gambia, one of the natives offered to traffic with him, and exchange slaves for goods. When informed that the white people did not accept of such a change, he seemed surprised, and said that this was the only means by which they could get their salt from Barbary. We may abandon the trade, but we cannot abolish it, and we shall besides be doing great injury to the Africans themselves. As to the humanity of the case, are we sure that the slaves, are not treated with much greater inhumanity in Africa than in the West Indies? Are they, not driven in their own country like cattle with irons about their necks? the humanity of the African, master is cried up, while that of the British is depreciated. An African master, however, we are told, can coolly toss his slave, when half dead, into a ditch, and say "there is so much money lost." Can any one bring, such an instance against the British, master of the present day? As to their being taken so far from their own country, this is a misfurtune to which the African slaves are always lia-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0340"/>
<col>651</col>
ble at home; for it is the general policy of Africa to remove the slaves as far as possible from the country in which they were born. Are you to consider this question on narrow grounds? While you think that you are doing more than justice to the negroes, do you reflect that you are certainly doing an act of the greatest injustice to the West India planters? We have been told that there is nothing new in this question; yet it has been confessed by people, of the best authority, that there never was an abler report than that which has lately been made on the subject. Perhaps the hon. gent. has not yet read the papers on the table. If he has read them, however, he cannot be ignorant, that the small settlers, supposing this measure to pass, must certainly remove from Jamaica. If he had taken a fair view of the subject, he would feel that the white men must be driven from the island by a regard for their own personal safety. The disproportion, therefore, between the negroes and the white inhabitants, would be constantly increasing, and would end in the total loss of the island. I do call upon the house to allow those to be heard at the bar who may have been on the spot, who are acquainted with the manners of the negroes, to carry some weight with their sentiments, in considering a point of this nature. A noble lord who had long an opportunity of observing the negroes, is ready to come to the bar of the house, if necessary, and give evidence of the alteration which has taken place in their manners. To what is this alteration owing? It is owing to this, that the idea of abolition is intimately connected in their minds with that of emancipation. The hon. gent. may perhaps say, <i>fiat justitia, fuat c&#x0153;lum.</i> But he is mistaken in the application of this principle, for certainly in the present instance it would only lend to bring the greatest calamity on the negroes themselves. I hope this house will deliberate on this subject as becomes their gravity and dignity as a legislative assembly, and that it will take care not to combine what is essential injustice to the planters in the West Indies, and to the merchants employed in this trade, with certain misery to the slaves themselves. It has been said that our feelings are sed on this subject, and that this misleads our judgment. Our feelings may indeed be roused, but it is a feeling for our all. You may take my life, if you take
<col>652</col>
the means by which it is preserved. I now come to the last point. I have given but a very slight view of the others, not wishing to tire the patience of the housed But though I have not taken time to do them justice, I did not think it would be proper, under all circumstances, entirely to omit them. The point to which I now wish to direct the attention of the house is, the importance of the trade to the revenue of this country, and on this I shall be short. I moved for documents on this subject, which have not yet been produced. However, I did not call for them altogether with a view to this particular question, but with a view to a motion, at a future period, for an inquiry into the state of the colonics. I shall now, however, be forced to resort to the returns of last session. From these it appears that the imports in 1803, amounted to about 17 million sterling. The article of sugar alone; amounted to 10 million, and the whole was between 16 and 17 millions. The whole of this property is, by these discussions, put in the greatest hazard from an insurrection among the negroes, on account of the inseparable connection in the minds of the negroes between abolition and emancipation? Under these circumstances then, is it not equally impolitic and unjust to allow a measure of this nature to pass? But you also hazard exports to an amount inconceivable. In 1803 fifty-one ships came into Ireland from the colonies, and no less than 129 were sent out of it with cargoes for the colonies, consisting chiefly of linen. By the ruin of the colonies this great market for Irish linens will be almost completely destroyed. I shall only then further observe, that in promoting this measure you are not doing an act of humanity to the negroes themselves, that you are doing the highest Injustice to the colonists, that you are neglecting your revenue, and putting a great part of it in the greatest hazard, and therefore forgetting the interests of your country. The great principle upon which you ought to proceed, is to do justice to every individual. The colonies are entitled to your particular attention, and their complaints ought to be heard with candour, and argued upon with coolness and impartiality. I hope you will not pay regard to any precedents, but consider the case precisely as it comes before you, without regard to what may have been done last year, when there was such a thin attendance. I
<image src="S1V0003P0I0341"/>
<col>653</col>
have the greatest hopes that the house will view, the question in its proper light, and concur with me in a decided opposition to the second reading of this bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01415"><member>Mr. Barham</member><membercontribution> said, that he was convinced that as an hon. gentleman below him had said, this was the time for the abolition of the slave trade, if it was to be done at all, he was satisfied that it was now practicable, that it was always desirable, but that now it was necessary. There were four points to which he wished to call the attention of the house; 1st. the general policy of the measure; 2d. its practicability; 3d. the danger arising to the colonies from not promoting it; and, lastly, the justice of the thing. As to the general policy, it was once said that this traffic was absolutely necessary. This assertion was, however, partly abandoned. This individual branch of trade would certainly be destroyed; but as it was only a small part, this was of less importance: 2dly, with regard to the practicability of the measure, he was once of Opinion that it was not practicable; and if the same circumstances had existed he would have been still of the same opinion. The capitals would once have been certainly carried away into foreign countries, but now the case was altered. Instead of engaging their capitals in hazardous specuculation, the merchants and planters would rather bring them home if necessary. Slaves could not now be smuggled into Jamaica from St. Domingo. He had no doubt that if the measure was passed now, it would succeed. It was not likely that the traffic would pass into other hands. Other nations had given indications of their intentions to put an end to the slave trade. He knew that no change could be adopted which would not be attended with danger. But was there no danger in continuing the trade? The proportion of negroes to the white inhabitants of the colonies was daily increasing. The traffic was constantly adding to the disproportion, and the desire of liberty was inflamed by every cargo of fresh imported negroes. Regard was to be had to the situation of St. Domingo, where there was no people to enter into competition with us in the West Indies. The danger of abolishing the trade was less, then, than that of continuing it. In the case of a man who laboured under a disease, what would a wise physician do? He applied the remedy while the patient was capable of receiving it; and thus stood the affair with respect to our West India
<col>654</col>
colonies. The fate of St. Domingo should be a serious warning to us on this head, and should deter us from adding daily to the number of blacks now in our islands: he spoke disinterestedly, for few estates were in greater want of additional slaves than his own. On a former occasion, he had suggested the idea of sending Sepoys from the East Indies to serve as troops in the West Indies; and he was not without hopes that this suggestion had attracted the notice of government. It appeared to him to be a mode happily calculated to remove a considerable part of the danger justly to be apprehended from the further increase of Africans. After a few more observations, the hon. gentleman concluded with making a few remarks on the unanimity of sentiment among the planters of the West Indies, of which so much had been said. Without meaning the slightest disrespect to those gentlemen, he must remind the house, that the interests of various classes of people materially affected their opinions; and it was not surprising that a set of merchants deprecated a measure, which, in their belief, threatened to prevent further extension of their commerce.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01416"><member>General Tarleton.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;Sir; I consider it as a duty incumbent on me to oppose this measure with all the ability which I possess. The question is such, that it certainly deserves the most serious deliberation, and the coolest investigation of the house, t trust, therefore, that the reasons urged against the measure will be heard and weighed with all that candour that becomes an assembly such as this. In the opening part of the speech of the gentleman who has just sat down, he said that now or never was the time to put in practice the measure of the abolition. Sir, I see nothing in the present time that, in this respect, peculiarly distinguishes it from former times. At all times, I have thought this a most ruinous measure, and the present time contains nothing to make me alter my opinion. In order to be convinced of the vast importance of this traffic in every respect, we have only to attend to the situation of Liverpool, and compare the state of that city with what it was not more than a century ago. Its population, about a hundred years ago, did not exceed 2,500. This population carried on its trade in about 100 barks. Its capital was then about 10,000l. What is its state now? It employs no less than about 5,000 ships,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0342"/>
<col>655</col>
manned by a proper compliment of seamen, the best and most expert in the British Navy. Its population is between 80 and 90,000, and its capital consists of the number of its former thousands turned into millions. Yet it is certain that this amazing prosperity is almost entirely owing to the slave trade. This is certainly a curious time to put an end to the source from which the wealth and grandeur of a considerable city in the Empire is derived. Bonaparte has said that we cannot contend with him single-handed: now, however, he is backed by Spain, and in all probability, Portugal will soon be ranged en his side. Are not, I would ask, our principle means of security derived from our seamen, and these are in a great measure, at least many of the best of them, procured by the trade of Liverpool. It is not a little astonishing, therefore, to hear any one say that this is the time for abolishing a trade which supplies us with so many seamen. Is the time when we are engaged in such a war as the present, a war in which so many seamen are required, upon whom we rest as our chief security, is this a time for such a measure as this, a measure that goes to complete the ruin of one of the chief nurseries from which our seamen, and consequently our measures of security, are in a great measure derived. This measure, sir, is certainly founded on the opinions respecting the rights of man, which have produced so much horror and devastation all over the world. It is a remnant of Jacobinism. I am sure that the hon. gent. who urges it, is not in his heart a Jacobin, but still the effect of his conduct is the same as if he were one. I shall beg leave to mention a story to him, in which I was myself concerned: I went to Paris in 1791 out of curiosity. Having arrived there, I was anxious, like most strangers, to see what was going forward. Among other things I wished to go to visit the jacobin club. But a friend, who knew the place bitter than I did, dissuaded me, saying, "Oh! my dear sir, you must not think of going there, you have opposed the abolition of the stave trade, and consequently are regarded as an abomination by the Jacobins, and you might be in danger of your life. At the same time I was given to understand, that if the hon. mover of the measure had appeared in that club, he would have been bailed with peculiar pleasure; the president would have given
<col>656</col>
him the fraternal hug. I was really told that a diploma of jacobinism was absolutely sent to that honourable gent. I am convinced that the principles of Jacobinism are those upon which this measure is founded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01417"><member>Mr. Fuller.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;am told, sir, that a contract is actually entered into by govt. to procure slaves as. troops for the West Indies at 551. per man. How this can be reconciled with the conduct of the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer on the present occasion, I am utterly at a loss to conceive. This is supporting a measure in one way, and opposing it in another. An hon. gent. had said that this was the proper time for abolishing the slave trade. This, sir, is in complete contradiction to the report of the assembly at Jamaica. This is not the proper time for this measure. There has not as yet been sufficient time for one of the parties to be heard. An hon. gent. has said that sufficient evidence has already been given. But this evidence has not been given on oath. Another reason against the abolition is that the plantations, especially the small ones, must absolutely be given up in case it is effected. It has been said, that foreign nations had given indications of abandoning this traffic. It is very easy for them, to be sure, to give it up, since they have lost almost all their colonies, and therefore have very little need of slaves; but is that the situation of this country? Another disadvantage which would result from the adoption of this measure is, that in such a case, we could scarcely find agents to manage our property in the West Indies. The great inducement to them for going out, is the chance of being able to procure slaves, and commence planters on a small scale at first for themselves. Unless a prospect of this kind is held out, it is certain that no people will remain in the colonies, avert for the management of our best estates. An hon. gent. has adverted to the want of compensation in this bill. Certainty it does happen, that in a bill that goes to deprive so many people of their property, there is not one clause to indemnify the sufferers, or their losses. Would this have been done even in a common turnpike bill? If the hon. gent. had proposed such a thing he would have been scouted from one end of the house to the other; and can the house be so indifferent respecting the colonies, that any person dares bring in a measure to treat them with such injustice, and by listened to with patience?
<image src="S1V0003P0I0343"/>
<col>657</col>
He would not dare to propose to meddle with English property in this manner. The only mode in which he could proceed would be this; he would say to the persons whom it might be thought necessary to deprive of their property&#x2014;we want your land for public purposes; we will pay down to you the value. Some men who would be obliged to attend to reason in common instances at home, still dare to bring forward oppressive measures respecting islands at 3000 miles distance. The situation of the negroes has been the subject of complaint. Is not the situation of the poor in this country in many instances worse than that of the negroes? Without meaning to boast, I have given permission to my own negroes to cultivate considerable spots of ground for themselves, and ample time for this purpose. I have lodged and clothed, and have engaged a physician to attend and prescribe to them. I have done every thing for their comfort. Can the hon. gent. say that he has done so much, with all his talk and noise about humanity, for the peasantry of Yorkshire? I do not wish to impute any unworthy motives to the supporters of the bill, but I am convinced, that as the man who pretends to more courage than another has generally less, so he who pretends to more religion than others, is often the greater cheat.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01418"><member>Mr. Hiley Addington</member><membercontribution> rose to express his opinion against the abolition of the trade; the question was certainly one of the greatest importance, and of vast magnitude, and the decision of it must be productive of great good, or of the most serious mischief. He was sorry to say, that the opinion he originally gave of the impracticability of the proposed abolition still remained unaltered. It was not from any want of consideration that his mind had not been changed; on the contrary, he had bestowed uncommon attention to the consideration of this question, from the circumstance of having the misfortune to differ in opinion from many hon. friends of his, and from some who possessed the most distinguished talents and highest endowments; he, at the first, thought the measure impracticable, and he thought so still, and he thought, moreover, that the cause of humanity had not been at all promoted by the agitation of the question, and was not likely to be benefited by its further discussion. He was aware that there was sort of popular odium attached to the defence of the existing slave
<col>658</col>
trade; but still he felt a perfect confidence that no popular prejudice of that sort would disincline the. house from giving a full and candid hearing to those who might think differently on the subject. As for himself, he gave his opinion as an individual, utterly unconnected with the trade, or with the West India colonies, having no other interest in the question, than the general interest which every member of that house, must feel for the prosperity of the empire at large. From the best consideration he could give the subject, it appeared to him that the abolition of the trade would be impracticable, and that the attempt would be rescinded; he therefore begged leave to enter his most sincere protest against the passing of this bill, and he should oppose the second reading.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01419"><member>Sir William Pulteney</member><membercontribution> said, he would not trouble the house at any length, but he wished to make a few observations. There was certainly a considerable difference of opinion, as to this bill. Some said it might be highly dangerous in its consequences; others, that it could not fail to be very advantageous. It was however ascertained, that the slave trade had been very advantageous to the West India islands. This bill was built on theory, and he was not fond of theories; they had been productive of too much mischief. The real fact was agreed upon by all parties to be this: the West Indies cannot be cultivated by Europeans, whose constitutions will not bear fatigue in that climate. It is therefore necessary, if they are to be cultivated at all, that it must be by some other class of the human species, who being natives of warm climates, are able to endure that degree of labour and fatigue which no Europeans could do in that climate. This being the acknowledged fact, the question, is, shall we abandon the cultivation of the West India islands altogether, or what class of the human species shall we employ to, cultivate them? Some say, that it is much better to employ free negroes than slaves, and that the labour of freemen would be more productive. This is, however, only a supposition, a mere theory, The fact is known to be, that the natives of warm countries are not naturally disposed to labour. In warm countries the climate produces the means of subsistence with so little labour, that they have no necessity, and consequently no inclination, for laborious work; and for that species of labour which was necessary for raising sugar and
<image src="S1V0003P0I0344"/>
<col>659</col>
other Colonial produce, it was obsolutely necessary to use something of compulsion. It might appear to some to be a great hardship to compel men to labour, but it was the common condition of the lower orders of society. It was by compulsion that we made our sailors go on board our ships, and this sort of compulsion was often very proper and necessary. As to the general management of the slaves in the West Indies, he could assert, from his own knowledge and means of information, that they were universally much better treated now than they were formerly, and that there has been as great a disposition as possible evinced to encrease them in the natural way. As to the Creoles, although they were superior for generation, they were inferior to the Africans in ability to labour, and it was found that they gradually grew weaker. It might, therefore, well be said, that experience has taught us that we cannot go on without the continued importation of those African slaves; and the only question would be, whether or not we were, in abandoning the trade, abandoning the cultivation of the West India islands altogether. He had often remembered to have heard many splendid theories advanced in that house, and supported with eloquence, which went off altogether, or were not found to answer. Eloquence was not always a proof of the justice of the cause, which it so powerfully supported. The great duke of Marlborough was certainly a very superior man, and a man of most excellent judgment, but he was never famous for his eloquence; he, however, had discrimination, and Weighed matters well; he knew what measures should be adopted, and what should be avoided. This was more than many eloquent men knew. To speak eloquently, and to judge rightly, were very different things. If it were merely to talk of humanity and justice, and those popular topics, the task would be easy; but in the present instance the considerations were more important, as involving the great interests of the country, and that humanity and justice which was due even to numbers of bur Own people to whom the West India trade gave employment. As to all the arguments that had been urged on account of the present situation of affairs in the West Indies, he thought them of no Importance. Although we are now at war, out enemies cannot take up the trade, yet we cannot suppose that we are to be always at war, and if the trade was now abolished, as soon as peace should
<col>660</col>
be restored, the French might again take up that trade which we would so imprudently have thrown away. Those arguments, that were only built on temporary circumstances, were not entitled to much weight. An hon. gent. had spoken of the danger that Would arise of convulsions and insurrections, from the continual importation of labourers from Africa. It appeared to him that the danger lay on the other side. If you were to stop all future importation, such a measure must give a very strong turn to the minds of the negroes now upon the islands: they might well say, if you think that the situation of slaves is so dreadful, that you will not allow any more of our countrymen to be made slaves, why are we to continue slaves still? If the abolition of the trade rests entirely on the reasons of humanity and justice, the same principles would lead as far as entire emancipation. If then, by abolishing the trade, you could convince the negroes in our islands, that their state was much more shocking than ever they had before considered it, the only consequence would be, that they would be more ripe for insurrection, which would bring an additional danger upon the colonies, From these considerations, he could not avoid opposing the second reading of the bill.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01420"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> said, he should trouble the house but very shortly, and be should not have done so at all if it had not been for some parts of the hon. baronet's speech, which he thought required some observations. The hon. baronet had talked a good deal about splendid theories Which had been, at different times brought forward in that house, and powerfully supported by eloquence, and which were afterwards dropped. For his part, he Was Utterly at a loss to conceive what splendid theory it was which the worthy baronet alluded to; but it appeared to be aft inference, which he chose to draw from his general positions, arid from his story of the Duke of Marlborough, that eloquence was So contrary to discrimination and judgment, that whenever the house heard an opinion eloquently and Well supported, they should, oh that account, rather presume it to be wrong. This would, indeed, be a very strange conclusion, and yet it followed, as clearly as possible, from what had fallen from the worthy bayonet. This great dread of eloquence was not peculiar to the worthy baronet. The Jacobins of France had also been much afraid of it was one of their maxims that there was
<image src="S1V0003P0I0345"/>
<col>661</col>
no sort of Aristocracy so dangerous as the Aristocracy of talents. The hon. baronet appeared to have imbibed that maxim, but he would hardly convince, the house, that the better they heard a measure supported, the more suspiciously they should receive it, and the more inclined they should be to consider it only a splendid theory. But what was the theory in the present instance? Was it a theory that the West India islands were in a very alarming State? This was a thing, however, which would be granted by every body, and which had in fact been universally granted. Was it a theory that the trade was bad in itself, and contrary to justice and humanity? Instead of theory, it was a positive fact, on which the supporters of the bill had rested their arguments. It was acknowledged on all sides, that there was an alarming disproportion between the numbers of the blacks and of the Europeans in the West Indies. It is allowed that there are at least 30 blacks to 1 white, and that from this great disproportion of numbers much mischief had already arrived, and much danger was apprehended. It can therefore hardly be called a theory to wish to diminish this danger, by diminishing that disproportion from which it arose. It was now 12 or 13 years since the house had come to a resolution for gradually abolishing the slave trade, and yet many of those who voted for this gradual abolition had hitherto opposed every measure which tended to carry into effect that re solution, and many of those who then saw the greatest danger from the disproportion between the black and white population, can now consent that this danger shall be constantly increasing with increasing disproportion. As to the war not being likely to last for ever, and the view of the question when peace should be established, he must say, he hoped as much as any gent, that the war would not last long, yet he must say, that if the solemn resolutions of the house of commons were to be carried into effect at all, the war certainly presented no difficulty, on the contrary he was sure that while the war continued, the argument could never apply on which the opponents of the bill placed their principal reliance, for certainly we could not be supplied with slaves by French or Spanish ships, as long as we were, at war with those nations. The hon. gent. concluded with observing, that it was most material that the house of commons should again declare its opinion upon this trade; there
<col>662</col>
must be a strong hope that an opinion so gravely delivered, and which had been so often repeated, would at length make a powerful impression on the public mind, and would be adopted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01421"><member>Mr. Huddlestone</member><membercontribution> said, it was his purpose to have gone somewhat at large into the present important question and the consideration which it involved; but the most essential of the points which he should have endeavoured to establish, had been enforced by other gentlemen with a degree of knowledge and ability so superior to any that he could have brought to the subject, that if he were to proceed in the course he had intended, he should, weaken the impression which their speeches cannot fail to have made both on the understanding and the feelings of every member present. The task, therefore, which he had prescribed to himself was much curtailed; but relying, as he knew he might, on the candour and indulgence of the house, he would not entirely forego this opportunity of lifting his voice (feeble as it must prove) in reprobation of that monstrous traffic, the toleration of which has so long been the opprobrium of the British legislature. It was far from his intention to charge this sin upon the nation at large; for well he remembered the nation at large had testified its abhorrence of it, by universally petitioning for its abolition; and it has since been a matter of astonishment to all Christendom., that those who are the constitutional guardians of British freedom should sanction elsewhere the most detestable system of op pression and cruelty that ever disgraced a civilized nation. He said he never conversed with an advocate of this traffic who chose to give a direct or serious answer to these simple questions.&#x2014;Is it just to exercise this trade?. Is it honourable to any govt. particularly one, the very essence of whose system is freedom, and whose highest boast is to secure it to the poor as well as to the rich? Is it houourable in such a govt. to encourage or permit this trade?&#x2014; He repeated, that he never could obtain a direct or serious answer to either of these questions. One has said, "you are mistaken; the slaves are, in fact, very happy much happier than the labouring poor in England." But he omitted to state in what their happiness consisted &#x2014;Another has answered; "would you have us drink our tea without sugar?" In other words, "would you abridge us Englishmen of part of our comforts merely to avoid mak-

<col>663</col>
ing slaves of Africans!"&#x2014;In this house the answers to such questions, or arguments connected with them, have been still more summary; they have been denominated cant, or fanaticism: but in a Report of certain proceedings which had been sent to him, and which he considered as a sort of manifesto on the part of the planters, they are ascribed to malice!&#x2014; A desire to secure a nation of freemen from the guilt of devoting millions of innocent persons to slavery, has been construed into malice to the planters, and pretended humanity! Now, he had not the least objection to this mode of answering the charges of injustice which were brought against this trade, because it is a virtual admission that no better answer can be given. In truth, the combined aggregate of human intellect would be inadequate to the task of disproving the injustice of this traffic. Were the belligerent powers of Europe henceforth to condemn their respective prisoners to slavery in their colonies, they would at least have this pretext, that those they enslaved were their enemies. But what pretence had we for enslaving the harmless Africans, who are so far from being our enemies, that they did not even know of our existence till they felt our tyranny? On the ground of humanity, every topic of argument has been exhausted; there is not a feeling of the human heart but pleads for the abolition of this barbarous traffic. On the point of expediency, if that is to supersede humanity, and every Christian virtue, it may, for aught he knew, be a fact in physic, that human blood is the best manure for land; and let the slave-dealer, before he starts at the idea of making this use of it answer this question&#x2014;which is the more merciful procedure, to bleed a man to death at once, or to flog and sweat him to death through every stage of lingering disease? But on this ground of expediency, including the safety of continuing this trade, he begged again to refer to the Report from which he had already quoted, which contains a passage not less satisfactory than the mode it adopts of disproving the injustice of the traffic. The passage is this: "it is admitted that the disproportion between the slaves and the inhabitants of a free condition, is one great danger arising from the state of the West India population." Now, sir, if any thing can be more gratifying than this candid admission, it is the answer to it, which immediately follows, namely, "but we can-
<col>664</col>
not allow that this disparity is likely to be augmented by a continuance of the trade with Africa, or by a positive increase in the number of labourers from importation. The great source of the inequality is the number of estates belonging to proprietors resident in G. Britain&#x2014;a few, long settled there, enjoying the fortunes left them by their ancestors in better times&#x2014;some for the education of their families, or from the state of their health. One agent often represents many absentees, and is desired to carry on the cultivation of their plantations with the smallest number of white people possible, from motives of economy."&#x2014;Thus, the present existing disproportion in numbers between the slaves and the freemen is admitted to be a great danger; but it is contended in answer, that a positive increase in the number of labourrers (a term which they happen always to prefer to the term slaves) will not increase that disproportion. Now, how a disparity, which is caused by the importation of slaves, can fail to be increased by a further importation of slaves, he had no faculties to discover. Here again, he rejoiced to observe that no better argument can be urged in disproof of the danger admitted to exist from the present disproportion. Thus, it seems to be like a fatality attendant on this traffic, that every argument offered in defence of it is built on the ground of interest&#x2014;of pecuniary profit&#x2014;opposed to every higher consideration&#x2014;to every motive that has reference to justice, morality, or religion&#x2014;or to that great principle which comprehends and unites in itself the opinion of them all. Place before the most determined advocate of this trade the image of himself in the garb and harness of a slave; dragged, and severed forever from each tie that attached him to existence, without one ray of hope to cheer him, without one point of consolation on which to rest; place before him this picture, and you will extort from him the reluctant confession that he would not endure for an hour the misery to which, he condemns his fellow-man for life!&#x2014;But even on this narrow ground, this degrading principle of interest, the advocates of this traffic have been refuted. And, in addition to the arguments so forcibly urged oh this point, he would ask, how it is that in the East Indies, where we also cultivate the sugar cane, and but for the favour shewn to this trade, which is supported by making slaves of a whole quarter of the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0347"/>
<col>665</col>
world, we could supply G. Britain and Ireland with sugar at a much cheaper rate&#x2014;how is it that in those vast regions we have the produce of the industry of 40 millions of people, of the great mass of the population without employing a single slave? Why certainly it is, because they are cherished and protected in the enjoyment of their rational rights. Whatever cause the great and powerful may have to complain; however we may have "bent the strong in arm, we have at least spared the feeble hand;" and let him ask them, if those who now cultivate the soil in our colonies were admitted to the blessing of freedom; if we were to give them rights, and to protect them in the enjoyment of those rights, why should not the same consequence result, and every advantage be derived from the free exercise of their industry, that we now extort from them by the whip and the chain? Is the labour of a freeman found less efficacious than that of a slave? Or at least would the further importation of slaves into our colonies be necessary, if instead of working out and exhausting in a few years those already there, we permitted them to live out the date which Providence assigned them: in a word, if by freedom and kindness we gave them a motive to wish for prolonged existence, and to multiply their species?&#x2014;But here he must not forget to acknowledge that the Report he alluded to by no means admits these premises, but on the contrary, contends that the situation of a slave in the West Indies is more fortunate than that of a Hindoo labourer in Bengal. And in support of this position, the writer, giving a statement of the earnings or wages of the Hindoo, the errors of which it were immaterial to point out, proceeds to describe the poor Hindoo's meal of rice and salt, "his miserable hovel, formed of materials which a wealthier class would refuse for fuel; a coarse mat his bed; the ground both his chair and table; unglazed earthen pots his furniture; a leaf his plate; his clothing (what the writer terms) a carf on the shoulder, and another on the waist, with sandals on the feet; a rugged home-made blanket, to protect him from the wet or cold, the only variation known to the peasant." After finishing this statement, the report triumphantly exclaims, such is the situation of 20 millions of free subjects of the British empire in India, whilst its legislature is Hunting for imaginary misery in the West
<col>666</col>
India colonies, where the lot of the labourer is a thousand times more fortunate The Report then proceeds to demonstrate that the herrings and salt fish allowed the slave cost more than the whole sustenance of the Bengal peasant; and this is the sole proof adduced of the thousand times more fortunate lot of the slave! The other luxuries he enjoys, in addition to his herrings and salt fish, are not enumerated Of his advantages over the Hindoo in respect to habitation, furniture, and clothing, we are also left to conjecture; In truth, the writer of this report, in this part of it at least, has proved himself to be but little acquainted with the subject on which he treats; for had he been at all conversant with the nature and character of the Hindoo and the Hindoo laws and system, he would have known that his simple and abstemious diet (which however is more varied than this statement admits) is both adapted to his nature, and enjoined him by his religion; that his habitation and cloathing are in fact suited to the climate; that his means, limited as they are, are not more limited than his desires. Some indeed of the stated points of hardship in the lot of the Hindoo peasant are common also to the Hindoo prince; and much of what the report describes as hardship and oppression in the lot of the Hindoo peasant is to him content and comfort. But it must have struck the house, that in this comparison of the lot of the Hindoo peasant with that of the, African slave, there is one not immaterial omission. Here he alluded to a difference in their respective lots, which it required a better pencil than his to delineate; he alluded to mental feeling. Here the humble Hindoo peasant, in his miserable hovel, has sources of pride and happiness, tat which not only the slave, but even his master, is a stranger: he is, it is true, a, peasant, and his labour and industry are devoted to an European lord; but in another view he is, in his own sincere belief, more than his lord's superior, for he conceives of him as of the very lowest casino earthly consideration would prevail on him to eat from the same plate; and he would not suffer his son to marry the daughter of his master, even if she could bring him the West Indies for her portion. The Hindoo peasant drinks of his native wells, and however scanty his meal, he receives it from the hands of the person who is most dear to him; his labours are for her
<image src="S1V0003P0I0348"/>
<col>667</col>
and their mutual offspring; and the thought of returning to them cheers him in his course, and lightens every toil; his daily task performed, he reposes with his family; no retrospect to former days disturbs his slumbers, nor dreams that cause him to awake to agony, at the dawn of day; no cries of dispair appal him; no barbarous sounds of cracking whips remind him, that with the form, and image, and feelings of a man, his destiny is worse than that of the beast of the field. And what, in his destiny, is to be set off against these humble comforts, he should leave to be stated by the advocates of this traffic, and return for a moment to what is more immediately connected with the question before the house, just to notice, that it has been Urged as an argument in favour of continuing this traffic, and if we relinquish it, other nations will take it up; but can it be contended, that if we prohibit the importation of slaves in our colonies, there would he the same demand for slaves there now is? Certainly not. Admitting, however, in the fullest latitude, that those whom we might abstain from enslaving, would be enslaved by others; was it no argument, or only one fit to, be remarked in that house, that we should be exonerated from the guilt? He was aware that he had presumed too long upon the patience of the house; but he could not sit down till he had congratulated the house and the country on the prospect there now seemed of a Removal of the stigma inseparable from the toleration of this trade. And he both congratulated and envied the hon. gent. to whose persevering benevolence we were indebted for that prospect. Even if the result of this discussion should be unfavourable, his cause of regret will be the least. The blessing of thousands who have perished by this traffic since the comencement of his labours, have already been his recompence; and in the event of an unfavourable issue to this discussion, the blessings of thousands yet to perish will be added to the score not to mention the immortal meed decreed to him, and the flames which aseended to his praise and honour in one of our commercial towns. With respect to the asperity and sarcasms lavished by some of the advocates of this trade on those who wish its abolition if it should he his lot to share them, he should not repine: nor would he follow the example of those gentlemen. On the contrary, he would acknowledge, that
<col>668</col>
some pesrons whom he honoured and respected, were among those who apprehended consequences from the abolition of the slave trade that he was persuaded there was no just ground to apprehend; and he believed that the present state of the French West India colonies must stagger them in this opinion. One allegation respecting their trade he was sure they do not believe, nor could he until positive proof be adduced of it. For were it true, that in order to procure slaves, we are ourselves the instigators of those wars which afford the miserable pretence for making them so, he should consider the sytem altogether as the consummation of human guilt. Upon the ground which he had endeavoured to state, and which had been much better stated by others, he should cordially vote for the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01422"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, he did not rise with any intention of entering into the debate, but merely in explanation of a circumstance which bad been stated positively, and which he believed had been very much misunderstood. Several of the hon. gentlemen who bad spoken, had talked of a contract which govt. had made for purchasing 5 or 6000 slaves in Africa. He had heard of no such contract; and did not believe there could be such a one existing. Such a proposition was made to govt. and the suggestion came from the West Indies; but it was immediately rejected. He believed the govt. had never conceived the idea of buying slaves for their use, as had been represented: their idea was very different, it was to purchase the redemption of those persons from a state of slavery whom govt. wished to employ as soldiers. This was an idea totally different from that of becoming purchasers of slaves, and would not be inconsistent with any opinion that might be given on the general question now before the house for the consideration of its members.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01423"><member>General Gascoyne</member><membercontribution> stated, that a proposition had been made from govt. to a merchant at Liverpool for the purchase of a number of the blacks alluded to, and he could tell the right hon. gent, that whoever accepted the contract, the blacks would be purchased on the coast of Africa.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01424"><member>Mr. Wilberforce</member><membercontribution> proceeded to reply, and observed, he never had any idea of treating this traffic otherwise than as a traffic in consistent with justice and humanity; nor
<image src="S1V0003P0I0349"/>
<col>669</col>
was it at the present less so in his estimation than at former periods; although there had been many regulations in the trade, and gentlemen who had uniformly opposed him in his endeavours to abolish the trade on the ground of inexpediency, agreed with him as to its being a trade which was inconsistent with justice and humanity, no difference existed between him and the greater number of his opponents but whether the abolition should be gradual or immediate; and, therefore, he apprehended there were but few, indeed, who would not agree that the trade was unjust and inhuman? and yet many gentlemen were too much in the course of pursuing a system, mentioned very properly by an hon. gent, on the other side of the house (Mr. Fox) that of using the argument of a gradual abolition, when the question of abolition came on in any shape, as a sort of argument in store to be used against any abolition whenever it was proposed; and accompanying it with a common-place observation, that the time was not fit for the Agitation of the question. Now, if these gentlemen were sincere in their declaration, that the slave trade was contrary to justice and humanity, and that a gradual abolition of it was practicable, he hoped some of them would do what none of them had yet offered, in the event of this bill being lost, which was to propose some plan of their own, for such an abolition as they thought practicable, and suitable to the present time; and he assured them they should have his assistance in any measure of that nature, if it should appear to him to be in any degree reasonable; this he hoped some of these gentlemen would do, if they were in earnest in their professions on the slave trade. He took notice of this observation* of an hon. hart, (sir Wm. Polteney) who had considered this subject as a theory, and he said, that the objection to the bill as a theory was an objection which might as well have been, and indeed Had been applied to all the regulations which took place in the trade, such as those in the middle passage, and other provisions of the like nature. He remembered the house was told when these regulations were before it, they would be the means of raining the trade; it might as well be proposed to abolish it at once, for all the horrors of the abolition would come upon them directly if these regulations were adopted; the regulations were adopted however, and in a few months afterwards the planters acknowledged the
<col>670</col>
plan of them highly beneficial to their, interests; and now they used the adoption of that plan as an argument against the abolition; and the very same arguments they used against the regulations which they now profess to admire, they now use against the abolition; all this, change in the sentiments of the planters, had taken place within 2 years; for these reasons he trusted the hon. baronet, who, by the way, had not always been so great an enemy to theory on every occasion, as he had professed himself to be to-night, would not persist in his opposition to this measure on that account, and he thought it extraordinary that men of such acute understanding as the hon. baronet possessed, should fall into such an error as this; the hon. baronet, in his dislike to theory, had overlooked the main argument on. which this measure was supported. He did not consider chat the population of the islands could be kept up by natural means, without any fresh importation, which had been proved to the house in detail by figures long ago, by accounts from the islands themselves. Whether tire, hon. baronet had paid any particular attention, or not, to the matter, most indisputably the fact was so; that after all the resolutions should have been adopted which had been proposed, the population of negroes in the islands would keep up so as to supersede the necessity of any fresh importation, was a matter not now disputed. It had been clearly established in America that the population of this description doubled in 20 years. The same effect under the same regulations, would take place in the West Indies. He would not say what the consequences would be of adopting the plan he now proposed to the house, bat if any one would read the report of the Jamaica assembly, which he had read with attention, he thought such a person would not readily say this plan would make the condition of that island worse than it was at present, with respect to its negroes; a situation into which they had brought themselves, for want of pursuing a plan similar to that which was intended to be tried under this bill, and which situation might be said to be that of being nearly in the jaws of destruction; a great deal of this evil arose from the practice of those who were called the book-keepers, to whom this trade of importation was a profitable concern, and he believed to them only, but the general sys-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0350"/>
<col>671</col>
tem of it was as injurious to the true policy of the islands as the trade itself of importation from Africa was. repugnant to justice and humanity. It had been so clearly established to be impolitic to continue the system in Jamaica, that a gentleman of great discernment had advised them in that island to drop it, or suspend it for a while, as the only means of getting rid of a great deal of embarrassment, as had been done with effect in North America; indeed, it was nothing more than proving the truth of the old proverb, "that honesty is the best policy;" and he was persuaded, that however some men might flourish for a while, they would, by neglecting that maxim, find themselves in the end overtaken by absolute poverty. He recommended this Jamaica report to the house, by which they would see the foundation on which he made these observations. In the course of 20.years the number of executions for debt ascended to 80,000, and amounted to 22&#x00BD; millions sterling. He left gentlemen to consider how far this might with propriety be called in a national sense a ruinous concern, and that therefore a general policy was against it, and to reflect on the propriety of making these public sacrifices to the private interests of these few book-keepers and individuals who benefit by the system. It was said, there was nothing new to be advanced upon this subject; that he denied. There was much that was new to be said, but it was not necessary for him to say it at present; but he hoped the house, in some future stage of this business, would be perfectly acquainted with all that was to be found in the papers now before it, and that would give them a proper idea of the slave trade, as it related to the condition of the bulk of the West India negroes. He had never considered it on that ground, because he did not think the case rested on that point, and he had abstained from the discussion of that topic, because he knew it was likely to produce irritation, and make parties in the house acrimonious against each other; but what he said was this, that the general state of the negroes in the West Indies would never be materially improved, if the African importation was permitted to continue; they would always be in a state of degradation, below that which ought to be the lot of the human species; they were like cattle, under the whip, in which improvement was impossible, nothing being applied to them but brutal
<col>672</col>
force, they could never possess any but brutal manners, so they must always, under such a system, remain, degraded in the estimation of others, and their own, receiving no moral instruction or improvement from the society in which they lived, or rather from which they were excluded; this prevented them from endeavouring to improve themselves, or their condition. He had endeavoured on various former occasions to impress upon the house the advantages likely to result from changing this system, by shewing that the abolition of the slave trade from the coast of Africa would have many very beneficial effects. It would make it the obvious interest of the master that the slave should be kept with as much care as possible, because his place could not be supplied; that after this, means would of course be adopted to take care of the health of every negro, and also of his moral improvement; encouragement would be given to marriage, and other legitimate objects would be pursued, by which they would become populous, industrious, intelligent, moral, and happy; by which we should have a powerful, though laborious and obedient peasantry; instead of a degraded race of beings, actuated only by a brutal impulse; but the house might believe him, they were capable of much improvement; it was dangerous to keep them in this state long; they were capable of reflecting on their physical, powers; they might be brought to feel how they might be able to destroy those who made or kept them captive. They might become possessed of that knowledge. There was reason to apprehend, that they would form plans, and devise means for carrying them into execution. They could see a distant object with clearness and pursue the means of arriving at it with vigour, and at the same time with patience. He would have gentlemen, who wished to continue this trade, reflect upon these matters, and take care they did not mistake the matter; for these negroes may reflect on their own situation long enough before they have in their own hands the remedy for their slavery; and if they took it by force, it would be done in a manner very different from that in which those who were their present masters could wish. And here he did not wish to avoid that part of the subject on, which the opponents of the abolition dwelt so much; he meant the eventual emancipation of the negroes in the West Indies. He had never concealed that his hope was
<image src="S1V0003P0I0351"/>
<col>673</col>
that such might be the ultimate effect of the abolition of the African importations but that was a period, the distance of which ha had never attempted to calculate, although his opponents had charged him with having it immediately in view. Had that been his object, or even his hope, he should deserve the word humane to be added to his views; but a shorter one, and that was the word mad, ought to be applied to his object; but although he felt that the immediate emancipation of the negroes in the West Indies could not be expected, for that before they could be fit to receive freedom it would be madness to attempt to give it to them, yet he owned he looked forwards, and so he hoped did many others, to the time when the negroes in the West Indies should have the full enjoyment of a free, moral, industrious, and happy peasantry. Nothing was to be expected from the colonial government: and in the open confession the assembly had made, it had dealt fairly with the house. As far as regarded that institution, no co-operation was to be expected, but this disgraceful traffic was to proceed as long as the patience of parliament, and he would add, the mysterious ways of Providence, would permit its continuance. Let, then, said the hon. gent. the house pause, and contemplate its present duties; the opportunity now offered may never return, and if the present moment be neglected, events may occur which will render the whole of the West India islands one general scene of devastation and horror. The storm is fast gathering; every instant it becomes blacker and blacker. Even now I know not whether it be not too late to avert the impending evil, but of this I am quite sure&#x2014;that we have no time to lose.</membercontribution></p>

His right hon. relation said that no contract had been entered into for soldiers to that amount. But since he had heard that explanation, he had made enquiry, and he understood the matter to be thus, (if not true, his right hon. relation would inform

him) that government had stated to West India merchants, that if they produced, by a certain time, 5000 black men, 2000 of whom were actually contracted for, government would pay from 501 to 60l.a man for them. He wished to know if that was an agreement which government had entered into with the West India merchants, for it was said they were to be taken up as soldiers in a black corps, not produced as slaves; and that in virtue of that agreement, a merchant at Liverpool was now fitting out a ship for the purpose of fulfilling that agreement.</membercontribution></p>

Several new clauses were introduced, among the rest one for subjecting ordnance stores and other bulky articles belonging to the army to tolls, when conveyed by inland navigation; and one for the better regulating the law with respect to the enlisting of apprentices and servants. The Secretary at War agreed in the propriety of making the provisions suggested by an hon. general (Fitzpatrick), relative to the age of officers on courts martial. He should consider the rest of the clauses proper to be offered

on that head, which would be ready by Monday. He should therefore move that the chairman report progress. After a few words in assent from General Fitzpairick, the chairman reported progress accordingly, and obtained leave to sit on Monday.&#x2014;Lord W. Russell, reported from the committee on the petition from the returning officers of Knaresborough, "that the petition was not frivolous; that it appeared to the committee that the election had been prevented by the riots; that John Carr and James Collins, the returning officers, were prevented by the riots from doing their duty; that J. M. Allen, W. Whitehead, Ann Housemann and others, were active in promoting the riots." The resolutions were entered, and the report ordered to be taken into further consideration on Tuesday next. Lord W. Russell stated, that the counsel before the committee apprehended a renewal of the disgraceful scenes that had caused the complaint, if a new writ should be issued, before which the house should take some measures on the report. The committed appeared to him to be of the same opinion, though they had not come to any resolution on the subject. He therefore moved "that no new writ be issued for Knaresborough for a fortnight." The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought the withholding of the writ too strong a measure, where there was no crime but a single riot, on which there was reason to suppose the committee would recommend no other proceeding than the punishment of the delinquents. After a few words from Mr. Grey, in which he agreed with lord W. Russell as to the sense of the committee on the suggestion of the counsel, though he coincided with the right hon. gent, opposite as to the impropriety of withholding the writ on insufficient grounds, lord W. Russell withdrew his motion&#x2014;Mr. Thornton brought up a petition from the the Court of Directors of the Sierra Leone Company, setting forth, "that the petitioners having, in the last session of parliament, presented to the house a petition for the continuance of a grant of 10,000l. for the support of the settlement of Sierra Leone, and for such other relief as the house should seem meet, a committee was appointed, which reported favourably on the said petition; and that, in. consequence thereof, the sum of 28,000l. was voted in the last session, for the maintenance of the Company's establishment

<title>[COMMISSION OF NAVAL ENQUIRY.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01433"><member>Mr. Giles,</member><membercontribution> pursuant to the notice he had given some time since, rose to move for the continuance of the powers granted to the commissioners of naval enquiry. To those who were not in the house at the time when he put some questions to the
<col>678</col>
gentlemen at the other side, whether they had any intention to prolong the commission, it was necessary for him to state, that he had put such questions, and had received no answer; and this was the cause of what might otherwise appear extraordinary, that the motion for the continuance was brought forward by him. Every person must admit, that the object of the commission, which was, to inquire into the irregularities and abuses connected with the navy, must be desirable. The persons appointed had, in the two years they had been in office, pursued the enquiry with an industry and integrity deserving the highest approbation; and their merit was established beyond the necessity of further proof, by the reports they had laid on the table of the house. At this moment they were still actively continuing their investigation, and they had yet much to do. The duration of the act by which the commission held its powers was uncertain. The act of the crown, which was but another term for the will and pleasure of a minister, might put an end to it in a moment, by proroguing parliament only for a day. The duration of the act was fixed, at its passing for two years, from the 29th of Dec. 1S02, and to the end of the next ensuing session of parliament. If parliament had met, as in the usual course, before the 29th Dec. the act would have held in force for another year. It was probably in the contemplation of parliament, at the time of the enactment, to afford an opportunity for the renewal of the act, if it should be thought advisable, by allowing the whole of a session of parliament to make a motion to that effect, in addition to the greater part of the session in which the expiration was likely to take place. He made this motion thus early in the session, because the commission was issued by act of parliament, and if parliament should think it necessary to continue it, it may be on its guard to do so before the act of a minister would deprive it of the power. He was not disposed, in cases of this kindy to place much confidence in men; The change that had taken place in administration, though it had not produced much vigour, had introduced much boldness. Another reason why he put himself forward on this subject so early was, that ministers on the subject of the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland, which they described as. so necessary and impor-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0354"/>
<col>679</col>
tant, had shewn so little vigilance as to render it unavoidably necessary to break through the forms of the other house to hurry the bill through, before the expiration of that which it was to replace, and even then a day or two of adverse wind would have caused it to arrive too late. Here the lion, and learned gent, recited the objects which the commissioners were empowered to inquire into. The official departments of the navy were the principal. Of these the admiralty had not been yet attended to. The navy board was much considered in the sixth report, but not completely examined. The office of the treasurer of the navy was described in the last report laid on the table; the victualling board had not yet been in any way noticed; nor the office for sick and wounded seamen, the department of prisoners at war or the transport office, nor the office of inspector of naval works. Thus a great part of the task imposed on the commissioners of enquiry remained yet unexecuted. It was impossible that in the ordinary duration of the session this remnant of the proposed labour could be gone through before its close. Much inconvenience would result from its non-continuance, which lie proposed to remedy by moving to continue it till the next session, when, if its further continuance was necessary, another motion of the same nature may be made. Those who supported the appointment of the commission were now called upon to vote for its continuance; and even those who opposed it, seeing the advantages that had resulted from the inquiry, were equally bound to give it full effect. The commission lately granted under the great seal to consider what remedies should be adopted for the evils discovered by the commissioners of enquiry, proved that the navy board was not adequate to the inquiry, as it was formerly urged by some, for this late commission stated, that the navy board was too much occupied to undertake even the secondary supervision there specified. He thought it not quite respectful to the house to. appoint, without any communication, those commissioners by royal authority, to act upon the reports of a commission appointed by parliament. The predecessor of the right hon. gent, has said, it was intended to submit to parliament distinct propositions on the. reports. The abandonment of this plan, and. the institution of the new royal So commission, he looked upon as disrepect-
<col>680</col>
ful to parliament. If the motion for the continuation of the act was not assented to, it would be seen, that there was in ministers a determination to resist reform. It was most notorious, that great abuses existed in all departments of the naval service; and those who made notoriety the ground for suspending the Habeas Corpus Act, could not deny it as a ground for the continuance of this commission. The hon. and learned gent, concluded with moving, "for leave to bring in a bill to continue the act appointing commissioners for naval Inquiry."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01434"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, that he by no means meant to propose to the house, not to continue the act, if its continuation should be necessary; but, that he did not think it necessary to vote its continuance before any occasion for that measure should appear. He did not hesitate to say, that the reports of the commissioners had been attended with much benefit, neither had he any difficulty in declaring, that, if there was not sufficient time before the close of the session to terminate the investigation referred to them, their powers should be further continued. But it did not now appear that the remainder of the session would not afford sufficient time. On the review taken by the hon. and learned gent. himself of the subjects proposed for enquiry, only one of any great importance remained uninvestigated, that was the victualling department; the transport department and the others were of inferior importance. He saw no reason, however, to suppose that the commissioners might not be prepared to make their report of the victualling office now, nor that they had not at intervals turned their attention to the other remaining subjects of inquiry, on which no report had yet been made, in such a manner as to leave little to be done to make up what they would submit to the house respecting them. He thought it right, therefore, to wait till a more advanced period of the session, and then if it should be necessary, he should have no objection to the continuance. The hon. and learned gent. had thought proper to allude to another commission, which he considered as disrespectful to the house, though it was not very easy to see on what such an opinion was founded. The object of that commission was to carry into effect every improvement! which the reports of the commission had' suggested. It was rather singular, there-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0355"/>
<col>681</col>
fore, to hear it asserted, that a commission professedly appointed for purposes of reform, was at all to be viewed as disrespectful to the dignity, or discordant with the duties of parliament. Seeing no reason then for pressing the hon. and learned member's motion at present, and conceiving, that if the circumstances of the case required it, there would be full opportunity afforded for renewing the term of the commission, he felt it incumbent on him now to conclude, by moving the other orders of the day,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01435"><member>Mr. Martin (of Tewksbury)</member><membercontribution> wished every success to the motion of the hon. and learned gentleman. He professed the utmost respect for the late first lord of the admiralty, and declared, that in his opinion, his exertions to reform the abuses in the naval department were highly meritorious. From the time he had first directed any pan of his attention to public affairs, he had seen reason to believe that naval abuses of the most flagrant description existed, and the noble lord deserved the gratitude of his country for his endeavours to extirpate them. The noble lord had fought our battles abroad bravely, successfully, and skilfully, and not satisfied with these exertions, he had set about the reform of abuses which were not only a disgrace to the board of admiralty, but a disgrace to the very character of the country. He thought the commission for promoting this great object an excellent one, and he should certainly vote for the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01436"><member>Sir William Elford</member><membercontribution> admitted that the commissioners of naval enquiry had done some good, but thought that their enquiries ought not to be carried on as they are at present. They had erected themselves into a kind of criminal tribunal, and heard and condemned on <i>ex parte</i> evidence. The member was proceding, when lie was called to order.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01437"><member>The Chanceller of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, that if the hon. member wished to arraign the conduct of the commissioners, the regular way would be, to move a day for the consideration of the reports on the table.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01438"><member>Sin William Elford</member><membercontribution> thought himself perfectly in order. He was only attempting to shew that the commission ought not to be continued as it was at present administered. The reports were such, that if published by any authority but that house, they would be deemed the rankest libels that ever were written. In one of them, there was a charge against a grand jury of
<col>682</col>
Devon, which, oh enquiry, he had heard was levelled at a Mr. White, Sheriff of Exeter, who was accused of having tampered with the jury, because some of his own relations were amongst the persons the commissioners had ordered to be prosecuted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01439"><member>Mr. Sheridan</member><membercontribution> conceived the hon. baronet would have been out of order, if he had not come to the point he had just now laid down. Having charged the commissioners with abusing their powers, and having suggested the propriety of restricting them, the hon. baronet was called upon to substatitiate his charge of abuse, and to bring forward a specific motion for curtailing the powers. If the commissioners were to be abridged of their powers to detect and punish the foulest frauds and the most flagrant abuses, in the most important department of the public service, it was fit that the cause of that curtailment should be made out. It was natural to suppose some extraordinary cause for the rejection of a bill supported by direct evidence. A loose imputation should not be suffered to tarnish the credit or diminish the powers of men who had exercised those powers for the benefit of the country. He thought the hon. baronet called upon in the first instance to make good his charge, that the commissioners had abused their power, and then to move that those powers be abridged.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01440"><member>Sir W. Elford</member><membercontribution> justified himself by stating, that he did no more than cite the case from the 8th report of the commissioners of naval enquiry.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01441"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> argued, that if there was, as the worthy baronet had insinuated, any fair charge against the commissioners for any of their Reports, this was not an evil for which no remedy existed. If any set of men had been injured, they were not without redress. If the commissioners had been guilty of any act of oppression, the house had the means of procuring to individuals improperly attacked full retribution. They could either recall or restrain powers which had been illegally or oppressively exercised. The hon. and learned gent, who had introduced the discussion had alluded to a variety of important subjects which remained for the investigation, of the commissioners, and the right hon. gent. opposite had not denied that these matters were extremely interesting in themselves, and deserving of serious inquiry. He had, however, thrown out a hint that there was reason to hope the investigation
<image src="S1V0003P0I0356"/>
<col>683</col>
might be closed before the close of session. But it was to be kept in view, that the proceedings of the commissioners had already been extremely laborious, that they had furnished many voluminous Reports, and that there was no reason whatever to suppose that in the short time which might intervene, previous to the termination of session, there would be time for bringing their investigations to a satisfactory conclusion. The benefits arising from the inquiry were not denied even by the right hon. gent. and he would appeal to the house, whether he was asking too much when he contended that the full benefit of the act authorising the inquiry should be obtained? There was a strong probability that, unless the bill was renewed, it would fail of producing that effect Which all seemed to have so much at heart; and could any thing therefore, be more reasonable than to put it out of all danger of expiring before it had produced all that reformation which it was calculated to produce? But the motion of his hon. friend stood on still stronger grounds, if the intention of parliament were to be allowed to have any weight. If parliament had met before the 29th of Dec. the bill would have remained in activity, and it was not requiring too much to require that the spirit of the act of parliament should be acted up to, and that the mere accidental circumstance of the delay of the meeting of parliament should not interfere in defeating a great measure of public improvement. There was one hon. baronet in the house (Sir C. Pole) who had been highly instrumental in promoting this important investigation, and who, he was confident, would state to the house that there was no hope of finishing the labours of the commissioners before the termination of the session. He wished to have that hon. member's opinion stated, for it could not fail to make a powerful impression. He was decidedly in favour of the original motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01442"><member>Sir Charles Pole</member><membercontribution> feeling himself called on by an observation of the hon. member, rose purely for the purpose of replying to it. He admitted that many important objects of inquiry remained yet to be examined, which it would be impossible to complete during the present session from the numerous difficulties that would arise in consequence of the war. He could not kelp adding, that when the measure had been first introduced, on the suggestion of
<col>684</col>
the noble lord, then at the head of the Admiralty, it was that noble lord's opinion that it could not be carried into effect during the war. The fact was, that the necessity of the measure had been felt during the last war, but the attempt to put it into execution had been deferred till the peace. As to what had been said with respect to the contents of the eighth report, he should only say, that he was not surprised at any thing which should come from that quarter.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01443"><member>Sir W. Elford</member><membercontribution> utterly disclaimed the slightest personal knowledge of the individuals to whom he had alluded. Nay, he had no connection whatever with them, and acted wholly on public grounds.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01444"><member>Sir Charles Pole</member><membercontribution> disclaimed any imputation calculated to make a question of the integrity of the motives of the hon. member for Plymouth. But the abuse of the naval commissioners came naturally from the constituents of the hon. baronet; for he did not believe that those commissioners were ever respectfully spoken of at the docks.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01445"><member>Admiral Markham</member><membercontribution> felt it impossible to sit still, without saying a few words on this subject. He had himself had the honour to introduce the bill into that house, and he enjoyed the best opportunities of beings acquainted with the intention of the noble lord who then presided over the naval department. That noble lord had undoubtedly not recommended the measure during the war, because he looked forward to a probable termination of it, and it was his intention to have its operations extended to the time that should be necessary for accomplishing its objects when it had been brought forward. He could state, and the Reports on the table would bear out his statement, that one-third of the naval expences of the country would be saved by an honest and upright discharge of the duties of the offices employed in their administration. This he believed in his conscience, and stated not on light grounds, He knew of some of those abuses now under investigation, which would astonish the house when reported to it. His hon. friend had stated, that there were many other branch, as to be investigated, such as the Victualling office, and the Sick and Wounded office which he had no hesitation in stating to be the most corrupt of all. He and every other officer of his majesty's navy had suffered by these abuses. There was also another measure, the prize-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0357"/>
<col>685</col>
agents bill, in which the whole navy was interested. A pledge had been given to bring it forward, but he had not heard any thing of it lately. He, however, hoped that it would be carried into effect, and that it would cure all the complaints that had been made for so many years by the navy. He was decidedly of opinion that the duration of the present measure should be extended till all the departments of the navy should be thoroughly purged. He did not charge upon the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, any intention to obstruct the investigations of the commissioners, but there certainly appeared in others a great inclination to impede their proceedings. When the bill had been brought forward, it had been said that the Admiralty or the Navy Board was competent to the purpose, but the right hon. gent, had admitted the propriety of continuing the present commission, by having appointed another commission to assist in their inquiries. As to what had been said by an hon. baronet, on the subject of the 8th Report, he thought it would have been more candid and manly to have made it the ground of a direct charge against the commissioners, than to attack them thus by a kind of pistol or side wind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01446"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> observed, that notice had been given in the present session by a learned gent, (sir W. Scott), of his intention to bring in a bill for regulating prize agents.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01447"><member>Mr. Creevey</member><membercontribution> expressed himself in terms of the strongest approbation of the labours of the commissioners for naval enquiry. From what they had already disclosed of frauds on the public, the house and the country had every reason to augur most favourably of their future exertions. He hoped too, that their reports would not be suffered to lie useless on the table, but would be followed up by corresponding improvement. It was the more necessary to allude to this, for he had formerly seen reports of abuses in the naval department which were suffered to sink into complete oblivion. He could remember 20 years ago such reports, and to this, though improvements had been suggested, they had never been reduced to practice, nor had enquiries, of which there was much promise and strong expectation, produced one important result, except the satisfaction of knowing that the public had been grossly plundered. He was sorry to be under the. necessity to alluding to the
<col>686</col>
royal commission, which in all probability was only instituted for ministerial purposes. There was among these commissioners one name, the insertion of which in a commission appointed for enquiring into the means of reforming abuses in the navy, was to him altogether unaccountable. This name was the name of Mr. Fordyce, who has for several years been supposed to be indebted to the public in no less a sum than the sum of 80,000l. The interest of that sum might be estimated at as much more, all of which was to be made good by tuxes from the pocket of the people. He knew it was said that this loss was attributed to a misfortune, and did not at all reflect on Mr. Fordyce's character. Let this, however, be as it might, he could not help saying that he thought it a most extraordinary circumstance, that a person standing under such circumstances should be on a commission, the very object of which was to destroy public abuses. He could have liked to have the subject brought forward by some other gentleman; but as this was not likely to be the case, he certainly could not, consistently with his duty, refrain from taking an early opportunity of bringing the matter under discussion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01448"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> was clearly in favour of the original motion, and could not conceive on what grounds the motion for the order of the day could be supported. It was evident that the bill, if allowed to be good at all, could not fulfil its object previous to the expiration of the session. There was no force at all in the observation of the right hon. gent, opposite, that at this period of the session the renewal was unnecessary. The house could have no means of knowing when the session was to terminate. It might terminate exactly when it suited the whim or the interest of a minister. But was the house to be told that an act, on all hands allowed to be beneficial, to be renewed just at the period when it suited the minister, and not when it was called for by the public interest? The idea was monstrous, and not to be endured for a moment. If parliamentary inquiry was to be instituted at all, then let it be instituted in the true spirit of inquiry, and not dependent on a minister's arrangement. But the right hon. gent. had endeavoured to argue, that there probably might be no necessity for renewing the act. Now, what single tittle of evidence had been adduced to countenance such an opinion? It was contrary to every conjecture, and every probability.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0358"/>
<col>687</col>
It was directly in opposition to the declared opinion of two hon. and gallant officers; the best acquainted with the subject. These hon. officers had expressly agreed, that it would be quite impossible for the commissioners to finish their inquiries within the period which might be expected to intervene, previous to the close of the session. One of the hon. officers (Sir C. Pole) had, indeed, expressed some doubt as to the continuance of the commission during the existence of a war; but he had expressed no doubt that much yet remained to be investigated, much yet was to be done be sore the mass of public abuses was laid open to view. He really could not help being astonished at the attempt to get rid of the original motion, by moving the order of the day. This was surely evading the: question in a most unhandsome and indefensible manner. If the right hon. gent, thought the commission unnecessary, or conceived that the commissioners made an undue use of their powers, why did he not, like the worthy baronet opposite (Sir W. Elford), state such an opinion openly and manfully? The worthy baronet had declared himself dissatisfied with the naval commissioners, and had expressed his opinion, that their inquiries should be discontinued. He had stated, that their Reports ought to be examined into, because he conceived they afforded ground for grave accusation. The hon. member had acted now as he did on a former occasion. On that occasion he had brought forward a direct charge, but by some misfortune or other, no member could be found to second his proposition. Though, however, he was in this respect unfortuate, it could not be denied that his proceedings were fair and honourable. If the right hon. gent, entertained similar ideas, why was it that he did not pursue a similar course? Surely it would be a course at once more honourable, as well as more parliamentary. To get rid of the motion by moving the order of the day was far from being a fair or candid proceeding. If gentlemen objected to the continuance of the commission, they would afterwards have a full opportunity of expressing their sentiments. They ought at least to suffer the bill to be introduced, and on the second reading they might then take the sense of the house, whether, it should be allowed to go to any subsequent stage. They had then only to oppose it, and. say directly at explicitly that the commission should
<col>688</col>
be closed. He thought that those who originally supported the act were now bound by every call of consistency to vote for the original motion. If they thought inquiry necessary, they certainly were bound to see that this inquiry was fully and advantageously pursued. If they had thought that gross abuses existed, on what principle was it that they refused their assistance in bringing them to punishment? On every view of public interest he was decidedly in favour, of the original motion, which he trusted the house would not suffer to be got rid of by the unfair and unmanly expedient proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01449"><member>Mr. Canning</member><membercontribution> spoke in favour of the amendment, but begged it to be understood, that in giving this vote be gave no opinion as to the policy of continuing the commission. Whenever this matter came to be canvassed, he should feel himself as not at all compromised by the vote he should give on the present occasion. A great deal had been said as to the intention of those who brought forward the measure, as to the time of its continuance. One hon. officer (Sir C. Pole) had declared his opinion, that it was not meant to be continued during a period of war. It was true that another hon. officer (Admiral Markham), had expressed his opinion that it was meant to be of unlimited duration, as long as there was any subject of inquiry not thoroughly investigated. Now, he contended, that with such opposite and contradictory opinions, in such a state of ambiguity, the house ought to pause before they came to any certain determination. This was precisely the object with the amendment he had in view. It was designed not to operate as a decision that the commission should be discontinued, but as a means of giving the house time to reflect to what period it should be extended, or whether it might not be possible to derive all the information required) without any renewal of the bill. Even allowing that parliament in the first instance intended that the bill should be extended to a period beyond what it would reach to without a new bill, the house now were not to be bound by such a determination. They were to be guided by dictates of policy and expediency. One hon. officer was of opinion that we ought by all means to preserve the commission in existence. Another hon. officer, equally well qualified to judge on the subject, thought, that during war, that operations
<image src="S1V0003P0I0359"/>
<col>689</col>
of the commission would be attended with many difficulties and embarrassments. When this was the case, what was there more natural than to adopt the amendment, which did not at all injure the commission at present, and presented the consequences of a too precipitate decision. There had been a good deal advanced respecting the propriety of bringing forward charges against the naval commissioners, if they were supposed guilty of any act of oppression. What situation would parliament be reduced to, if not a word were to be uttered in that house against a commission of five persons possessing larger powers than had ever been entrusted to an equal number of men? Was it not competent to any member to call in question the propriety of allowing a body to proceed in their usual way, which had been charged with having published a libel against so admirable a part of our constitution as the grand jury of a county? He did not think it decorous, that an hon. member, when such was his object, should be publicly asked, whether he was prepared to substantiate a criminal charge against the persons composing that commission. After the declaration which had fallen from his right hon. friend, he could see no possible advantage which could result from the measure proposed by the learned member, and he would therefore vote for the order of the day.</membercontribution></p>

If, in what he said, there was an appearance of taunt, it was not applied to the worthy baronet, whom, on the contrary, he praised for his fair and open dealing.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01451"><member>Sir Charles Pole</member><membercontribution> gave it as his opinion, that there were at present matters of the highest importance before the commissioners, and that, in all probability, their labours could not be ended within the session.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01452"><member>Mr. Bragge Bathurst</member><membercontribution> rose, not for the purpose of complying with the demand of any gentleman, whom he would not admit to have the right of personally requiring of him an explanation as to any change in his sentiments respecting the continuance of the commission, but to state his reasons for opposing the motion. After the candid manner in which the motion
<col>690</col>
was met, he had been in some expectation that the hon. and learned gent, would not have persisted in his motion. It was not now necessary to discuss; whether the commission should last one or two years. Undoubtedly the intention of parliament was, that such a commission should exist, and it was therefore proper that a reasonable time should be allowed to it for transacting the business with which it was entrusted, consistent with fair expedition. With respect to that part of the learned gentleman's argument, which tended to maintain the necessity of renewing the bill, because it was within possibility that the prerogative might be exerted to destroy the existence of the commission, he thought it the most extravagant he had ever heard. It was not proper for parliament to argue and decide upon such outrageous presumptions. It was not credible, that any minister would be found to advise the exertion of the prerogative for such a paltry purpose as that of getting rid of the present bill. There was no immediate necessity apparent to him for taking the subject into consideration, and he would therefore vote for the previous question, merely upon the declaration of the right hon. gent. under him.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01453"><member>Lord Henry Petty</member><membercontribution> did not see the necessity that in cases where great powers were confided by Parliament, the persons invested with those powers should be restricted in point of time. The proposal of his learned friend went no further than to give the bill the extent which it was now demonstrated to the satisfaction of the house it was originally intended it should have. He thought that parliament having once adopted the measure, was, in consistency, bound to continue it. There was little apprehension, that the ideas thrown out by some persons, respecting the danger which might result from the existence of such a commission, without any thing to operate upon, should ever be realised. The abuses which it was the object of it to discover and correct were numerous and notorious, and he hoped, that the advocates for passing strong measures, such as the suspension of the habeas corpus act in Ireland, upon the sole grounds of notoriety, would not deem themselves justifiable in opposing a measure founded on their own principles, and from the continuance of which it was universally allowed the public had derived the most extensive and important advantages.</membercontribution></p>

<col>691</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01454"><member>Mr. I. H. Browne</member><membercontribution> said, that he gave great credit to the barriers of the bill when it was first introduced into the house, and the reports of the commisioners acting under it had confirmed him in the good opinion he had then formed of it. With every deference to the opinion of the hon. baronet who had so worthily acted under it, and every confidence in the promise of the right hon. gent. as to its continuance, he thought the measure so important and necessary that he could not but vote for the present motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01455"><member>Mr. Tierney</member><membercontribution> said, he was surprised, from the trifling, if any difference of opinion, which existed between both sides of the house upon the merits of this bill, that there should be any objection to a motion for its further continuance. It was allowed on all hands that the commissioners acting under this bill had, throughout the whole of their conduct, with the exception of one single instance only, deserved the highest praise. Why, then, should the house hesitate to invest such commissioners with the powers necessary to enable them to discharge their duty with full effect? In order to this, he thought the existence of their power should be stable, and not dependant on the duration of a session. As to the danger apprehended from such a commission during the existence of a war, he thought that the experience we had already had, was sufficient to remove that apprehension. The commission had originated in time of peace, but yet we had been at war during the greater part of its continuance, and yet no inconvenience whatever, appeared to have resulted from it, but quite the contrary; and it was his opinion, and that of many gallant and intelligent officers, that if it were interrupted in its progress before its investigations' should be completed, very great mischiefs would arise. An hon. baronet had stated, that if the object of the commission appeared to be unattainable before the expiration of the sessions, application would and ought to be then made for the continuance of the bill. But he would put it to the candid consideration of the house, whether, thinking as they and the public did, of the exertions of these commissioners, it would be decorous to limit them in point of time, or wait for their application to continue the act? Whether it would not be more becoming to be beforehand with them, and to renew the bill at once? His opinion was decidedly in favour of the latter
<col>692</col>
course, and he saw no good, though he could well suppose much evil, that might fellow from the postponement proposed by the motion of the right hon. the Chancellor of the Exchequer. To the assurance of that right hon. gent, that he would bring forward a proposition for the continuance of the act under consideration in the course of the session, should necessity appear to call for it, he was ready to give credit. But it might happen that the right hon. gent, however well disposed, would be unable to carry the proposition into effect. Many changes might occur in the course of a session; he did not mean to speak as to ordinary events; but even in the situation of the right hon. gent, a change might occur. Perhaps the right hon. gent. did not feel at all the uncertainty of a situation in power, though he could assure him, that he himself felt that uncertainty; and therefore it was that he could not entirely rely on the right hon. gent.'s promise, or, rather, that he could not rely on his capacity to fulfil it. He would not risk this important bill upon a contingency, and if the situation of the right hon. gent. should be changed* his wishes and eloquence might not possibly have sufficient influence to carry the renewal of this bill. For this reason it was, that he desired to press the motion for its renewal at present; and also, because he thought such immediate renewal necessary to give vigour and efficacy to the operation of the commission. No man could suppose that that commission could proceed with such effect, if they were to calculate upon the expiration of their power within three or four months, as if that power were enlarged in the manner proposed by the motion. It was impossible indeed, that they could accomplish the object of their inquiry within the session. They had, he understood, much information to look for from distant countries, particularly in their enquiry into the victualling department. How then could it be reckoned upon that such enquiry could be completed within a short time; particularly as it was stated by his noble friend, that their business was fast accumulating? With respect to the allusions made to the views of those by whom the motion was proposed, those views he did not know; but he knew the view which induced him originally to support this bill. That view was, because he thought it proper and necessary to investigate the abuses that were generally supposed to ex-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0361"/>
<col>693</col>
ist in the expence of the different departments of the navy. Of this necessity he was now fully convinced. The vast mass of evidence on the table, furnished by the reports of those commissioners, was the best testimony of their merit, and the strongest argument in favour of the motion before the house. Those reports contained such matter as was highly deserving the attention of the house, and such as he trusted would, by becoming the subject of serious consideration, prove that parliament was as anxious to interest itself in the concerns of public economy as in any other subject.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01456"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> in explanation stated, that some gentlemen seemed to misunderstand his observations with respect to the reports from the commission to which the motion before the house referred. He had said, that there were many important suggestions in those reports; but he would not be understood at all to pledge himself, to take any particular proceeding in consequence of those suggestions.

<title>[SALT DUTY BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01462">On the motion being put, that the salt duty bill be read a second time,</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01463"><member>Lord William Russell</member><membercontribution> said, the effect of this tax upon the labouring parts of the community, would be most deplorable. He confessed, he did hope that the second reading of the bill would have been deferred until gentlemen should have had lime fully to consider the report of the salt committee of a former session, which the house had, on a late day, ordered to be printed. The labours of that committee were valuable; and he hoped that the members who composed it would that night follow up the wise, humane, and patriotic resolutions, by opposing the present tax. By the report, it was obvious that the committee under the last administration purposed, by their report, to lead to the abolition of the tax on salt altogether. Salt was an article important to all descriptions, and as it was used by all for the most beneficial purposes, he trusted all descriptions of persons, in that house, would oppose the tax now sought to be laid on it. It would be recollected, that bread was a principal article of sustenance used by persons of all descriptions throughout the kingdom: now, by this tax it was unavoidable, that the price of bread should be raised; in fact, bread had been already risen an assize by the mere report of such a proposition. There was a petition, at that moment, before the house, from the baker's company, praying for relief, in consequence of various alterations in the, sources of their profits, and in particular because of this tax. Throughout the country the effect must unavoidably be the same. It would affect the price of salt used in all kinds of salt meat, so as to place them above the reach of the poor. Salt-fish was an extensive article of sustenance in many of the labouring parts of the kingdom; this would experience a rise of price amounting to little short of prohibition. The tax would entirely alter the condition of the lower orders. It would render them totally dependant on the affluent for support. It would prevent them from maintaining that state of independence which
<image src="S1V0003P0I0363"/>
<col>697</col>
was their birth-right, and which it was peculiarly the business and duty of that house to preserve to them in all its integrity. For these reasons, and thinking most unfavourably of the lax; thinking it, in fact, pregnant with all degrees of wretchedness to the lower orders of the community, he should move, "that the bill be read a second time this day six months."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01464"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> observed, that the committee in the report which they gave in some years ago, and. which had been alluded to by the noble lord, proceeded on the ground of rendering salt applicable to many general purposes, among which was even that of manure. It was certainly their object to give facility to the circulation of that article, but the chief hindrance to a free circulation was the regulation which the duty necessarily demanded, and these regulations would equally affect, the circulation whether the duty amounted to 5, 10, or 15s. a bushel, so that the noble lord ought not to be satisfied with advising a rejection of a revenue of 500,000l. which the proposed additional duty would produce, but should proceed to advise the taking off the duty now 'existing, which produced a revenue amounting to double that sum. It was singular that the noble lord should call on those persons, who, when the country was at peace, approved the report of the committee, and yet did not venture to institute any measure upon it, to come forward, and in the midst of war declare their opinion on the present bill. The report had slept for 3 years, and the consideration of it was now urged, at a time, than which, none could be more unfit. The noble lord had asserted, that this tax pressed heavily on the poor. It was a most unpleasant thing for him to be under the necessity of imposing taxes which in any degree affected the lower classes, but he had a sacred duty to perform. We were engaged in a contest for the defence both of rich and of poor; supplies must be found; and no mode of raising them seemed to him so little liable to objection as the present. On the day when he first introduced this and his other measures of finance, it was objected by an hon. gent. that they did not fall sufficiently on articles of consumption. The noble lord had not been just in saying, that govt. had abandoned the interests of the lower classes. Let him look at the taxes from the year 1793 to the present time, and he would find that they have been in every instance
<col>698</col>
exonerated at the expence of their superiors. The income tax, the wine duty, the duty on foreign spirits, and a variety of others sufficiently proved this. The sum estimated as likely to be raised from this additional duty on salt, was 500,0001. at 5s. per bushel, and therefore proceeded on a calculation of two millions of bushels being consumed. There were eleven millions of consumers, and it must be obvious to the house, how much greater a proportion of this tax would fall or the higher classes than, on the lower. On a fair calculation, the consumption of a cottage containing a family of five persons, would be considerably short of a bushel in the year, making an annual duty of only 3 or 4s. and this it should be recollected, was collected gradually, and from week to week, so that its influence would scarcely be felt. Taxes on consumption to be productive, must be laidon articles of general consumption, As to the apprehended increase in the assize of bread, it never varied, unless a fluctuation of at least 1s, 8d. took place on each sack of flour, and the quantity of salt used in this case was so small, it was such a trifling fraction, that it could not possibly affect the price. He hoped, therefore, however specious the arguments used by the opponents of the measure, however they might affect to be the advocates and protectors of the poor, that the house would see through the fallacy of their objections; and that in the support of a cause in which the higher and the lower classes were equally concerned they would not hesitate to afford to his majesty's government those means which were proved by them to be the least objectionable for that, purpose.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01465"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> declared that he had seldom risen to give his opinion against any tax ' which appeared to him more objectionable. The right hon. gent. had asked why, if the suggestions of the committee on the salt duties were politic and expedient, they were not acted upon during the existence of peace? To this the answer was at once simple and conclusive. The house would recollect that the report was made in 1801, and it was only in that one session that the interval of peace gave any opportunity for bringing forward a proposition for the repeal of the salt duties. At that time those at the head of affairs, and those who brought forward the report, had hot time to make up their minds how far a bill for the repeal of the duties was expedient, or in what manner the deficiency arising to
<image src="S1V0003P0I0364"/>
<col>699</col>
the revenue should be supplied. But it was, indeed, a very different thing to talk of the absolute repeal of a tax allowed to be obnoxious, and to come forward with a proposition for augmenting it to a monstrous extent. Whenever this country was restored to peace, he hoped and trusted that the tax would be totally annihilated, But, said the right hon. gent, if the old tax cannot now be renewed, on what principle was it that gentlemen objected to the increase? This, truly, was a very singular and novel sort of reasoning. He would ask the right hon. gent, if the tax amounted only to two hundred thousand pounds he would object to the repeal? He believed the right hon. gent, could then have no doubt as to the policy of the repeal. The old tax amounted to a million, hence arose the difficulty of destroying so large an amount of revenue. But the new tax proposed to render this revenue greater by five hundred thousand pounds, and hence the difficulty of the repeal was greatly enhanced. On this ground, if he had no others, he should therefore object to the fresh imposition. It was not only oppressive now that war existed, but would infallibly throw fresh obstacles in the way of the repeal, whenever peace came to be restored. Now, as to the tax itself, he further objected to it, that it attached to one of the direct necessaries of life. With respect to many articles of consumption to which taxes applied, the lower orders had a remedy, either by discontinuing them altogether, or by using them in a more sparing manner. But here the evil could not by any means be avoided. The right hon. gent, had said, that the fisheries would not be affected in consequence of the drawback to be afforded. The very necessity of the drawback was, however, an argument against the tax. Difficulties srpse out of drawbacks in two ways. In the one case, the revenue was defrauded, pr in the other, the individual would not derive the advantages intended by the legislature. He could suppose the case of a poor man who cured a small quantity of fish chiefly for his own use; but perhaps, partly for a retail trader. Now, in this case, it was next to an impossibility to make the distinction betwixt the salt used for this trade, and that employed for his own use. As to the tax generally, he condemned it in its application to the poor, as countrary to every principle, on which taxation had hitherto been founded. It had always been hitherto acted on as a general
<col>700</col>
principle, that wheat, corn, and butcher's meat, should not be directly taxed. Here, however, butcher's meat was indirectly taxed, and that sort of food which the lower orders principally depended on for their subsistence. The right hon. gent, had argued that the tax would fall lightly on the poorer classes; but how did this appear, when it was to attach chiefly to salt provisions, which, with the exception of bread and potatoes, where salt too was indispensable, constituted the sole support of the laborious orders? He did not pretend himself to have much information on this subject, but he had felt it his duty to inquire into the business, and he found, that if twenty score were to be salted, it would require no less than a bushel and a half of salt. It was true that a hog of this size was not likely to be in the hands of a person in the lower orders of life. But this, so far from weakening, strongly corroborated his argument. It was well enough known, that if a bog of a smaller size was to be salted, a greater quantity, of salt in proportion would be required. Supposing then that a small hog was to be salted, and a quantity of salt, which now paid a duty of 14s. was required, the same quantity would cost 20s. for though the tax was only 5 shillings, yet the retail dealer would certainly raise it to six, if not to a still higher price. He wished gentlemen to bear in mind, whether this addition would not, to a poor cottager, prove a very serious addition. Now, as to the effect of the tax, so far as respected our agriculture, he had consulted many of the best judges in the kingdom, and they were all of one opinion, that the total repeal of the salt duties would be one of the most important measures which could be adopted. They all allowed, that if salt free of duty could be employed on a large scale, it would be productive of incalculable benefit. It behoved gentlemen then well to weigh this before they consented, to a fresh, imposition, by which the use of salt in agriculture would be in a great measure prohibited. Here the same arguments as applied to the fisheries could not be employed, because a drawback could by no possibility be employed. Conceiving, then, the tax in all points of view impolitic, he most heartily supported the motion of his noble friend.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01467"><member>Mr. Giddy</member><membercontribution> also spoke shortly against the tax. From his own intimate experience, he was sure that it would be highly detrimental to the fisheries. When the last tax on salt was imposed, over a great extent of coast, the curing of fish was for a considerable time almost wholly suspended. In many parts of the country where the people almost wholly lived on salt provisions, the tax would be productive of much serious inconvenience, even misery. He strongly recommended the substitution of some other tax in its room, as the present was unjust in its principle, and impolitic as well as oppressive in its operation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01468"><member>Sir William Pulteney</member><membercontribution> was decidedly against the measure. He had no doubt that if the war had not broken out, the suggestions of the committee on the salt duties would have been carried into effect. The only question was; if the salt duties had been repealed, what other duties should be resorted to to cover so great a deficiency in the revenue? The argument of the right hon. gent, opposite, that the tax would not be oppressive, because it would only make an addition of 4 or 5 shillings to each family, was totally unfounded. The fact was, it would create an addition to this amount in every individual of a family, and would any one deny that this would be a most heavy and serious pressure? Hitherto it had been the object of the house to exempt from taxation all articles of indispensable necessity to the sustenance of life. Other articles of convenience or luxury might be given up, but here, it was proposed to lay a very severe impost on an article admitted on all hands to be an article of primary necessity, and one which was essential not to the comfort only, but the very existence of the lower orders. Salt was like leather, and candles, and a few other articles, which only deserved the name of necessaries in the strictest sense of the term. The house were aware that a tax on such articles was attended with inconveniences far greater than the bare amount of the impost in the first instance. The moment the tax was promulgated the, retail dealer took advantage of raising the article taxed to a vast tax for the consumer. This rise was in all cases exceedingly oppressive to the
<col>702</col>
labouring classes of the community. He referred the house to what had been found to be the effect of the salt tax in France. There it was found to be a most odious, oppressive impost, and more than almost any other cause excited disgust against the government. There too the rise of the price counteracted the views of those who projected and persevered in the tax. The people in most cases diminished the consumption, and in others totally disused it. It was a fact that, when the price was comparatively small, there were twenty-eight pounds consumed, while in the same family there was not a consumption of twelve pounds when the price became exorbitant. The hon. baronet desired the house to look to the state of the northern counties, and the sort of bread which constituted the principle food of the laborious classes. Salt was indispensable to the formation of this bread, and surely it was the height of impolicy to augment burdens among those who were the least able to afford them. He should ever set his face against taxes affecting, as this did, the middling, and he would contend, the most valuable part of society. If such taxes were accumulated, it was easy to foresee the consequences. We could not raise the public burdens. We must come to a stand. The state, like other declining empires, must see its last day. He conjured the house by throwing out this measure, to shew their desire to avert so dreadful an evil.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01469"><member>Mr. Rose</member><membercontribution> would not follow the hon. baronet through all his observations on the public expenditure and economy. He had expressed great alarm lest the additional duty should decrease the consumption, but he could inform him that the last duty laid upon salt had had the effect of of increasing the consumption. Ah hon. gent. on the other side (Mr. Pox) had been most egregiously misled in the calculation he had submitted to the house of the quantity of salt necessary for salting pork. He had been informed by his cook, that for a bacon hog of 14 score not more than 13 or 14 pounds of salt was necessary. As to finding a substitute for this tax, it was utterly impossible to find a substitute for a tax that produced a revenue of a million sterling. It was very easy for gentlemen to abuse any tax that might be Offered for their consideration, but he was convinced that under all the circumstances of the times, no one could be found less exceptionable than the present.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01470"><member>Mr. Fox,</member><membercontribution> in explanation, said, that it
<image src="S1V0003P0I0366"/>
<col>703</col>
was not the quantity of salt used in gentlemen's families for salting that should be stated, but that used by cottagers; in the former many parts of the hog were, perhaps, thrown away, while by the latter no portion was suffered to be wasted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01471"><member>Mr. Rose</member><membercontribution> explained, that his calculation went to the whole, of bacon hogs salted for the use of his family.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01472"><member>Mr. Alderman Combe</member><membercontribution> alledged, that the wholesale dealers would make this tax a pretext for an enormous rise on the retail dealer, and consequently on the consumer, and he also wished to correct a mistake into which the chancellor of the exchequer had fallen; namely, that it would have no effect upon the price of bread. It was very true, that by the former act the price of bread was regulated according to that of flour only; but, by the last act, every article of expence to which the baker was subjected was taken into account, and the price of bread for the week regulated accordingly.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01473"><member>The Secretary at War</member><membercontribution> wished also to correct a misstatement made by the hon. baronet (sir Wm. Pulteney) when he said that the new tax would be an addition of 4s. on each individual of a family; whereas, by referring to the consumption of salt, and comparing it with the population of the country, it would be found to amount to no more, on an average, than 4s. a year upon each family, and not on each individual.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01474"><member>Mr. Huskisson</member><membercontribution> replied, that Scotland had not been subject to more than 4s. duty, when England paid ten, and that the whole amount of the duty for Scotland never exceeded 50,000l.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01475"><member>Mr. Johnstone</member><membercontribution> vidicated the statement of his hon. relation (sir W. Pulteney), that this sum must apply to individuals and not to families. In the report of the committee on the salt duties it was stated, that each person on an average consumed 14 pounds of salt in the year, and this by the old tax made 2s. 6d. The new tax would make 1s. 3d. more, being nearly the sum alluded to by his hon. relation. He was clearly against the tax, and maintained that it would hold out new temptations to smuggling, which, in the northern parts of the island, was already carried to au enormous extent.&#x2014;The question being called for, the house divided,

<p id="S1V0003P0-01480">Petitions were presented by lord Archibald Hamilton, from Lanerk, Ruthuglen, and other places in Scotland, praying a repeal of the corn act of last session.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01481"><member>The Secretary</member><membercontribution> at War took occasion to call the attention of the house to the subject of those petitions. It appeared to him that the petitioners complained of the evils of a, bill, which, in point of fact, had not yet come into action. The bill was hot to operate until corn was at a certain price; and as no such case had yet occurred, he thought the people were deluded, and persuaded to feel a grievance of which they had yet had no experience.</membercontribution></p>

In this case, however, the evil was actually experienced. The very passing of the act had done considerable mischief. It had created an alarm that had not yet subsided. It had raised the price of corn. But, even supposing that it had not produced that effect, if the object of the bill were exception able, it was of course such as the people were entitled to deprecate, and against which it was their right, interest, and duty to. petition.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[MUTINY BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01489"><member>The Secretary at War</member><membercontribution> proceeded to move the third reading of the mutiny bill. In making this motion he was afraid that lie should disappoint the expectation of the hon. officer on the other side, (general Fitzpatrick) as he was not prepared to submit the propositions which that hon. officer recommended on a former flay. For himself, he was ready to confess, that those propositions appeared to be perfectly reasonable. They were, according to his recollection, that the members of regimental courts martial should be sworn, that they should be authorized to administer oaths to witnesses, &amp;c. and that no president of such a court martial should be under 21 years of age. However, al-
<col>708</col>
though they were unexceptionable in his opinion, there were many officers of considerable experience and high rank who entertained doubts of the propriety of introducing such innovations into the old established system of the army. To the doubts of such persons he. thought it proper to defer, although he was free to own, that in the objections they advanced he saw no force. Yet it was due to them to allow time for fuller deliberation on the subject, and with a view to that he would propose a slight alteration in this bill, which could not be conveniently delayed in its progress, to this effect, "that it might be altered or amended within the session." This alteration would, he hoped, meet the concurrence of the hon. officer, as it would afford an opportunity of introducing the amendments he suggested.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01490"><member>General Fitzpatrick</member><membercontribution> said, that in consequence of the conference he had had with the right hon. gent. and the obvious justice and necessity of the propositions he suggested, which met that right hon. gent.'s entire concurrence, he had thought it unnecessary to trespass on the attention of the house, by stating the grounds upon which he was urged to submit those propositions. Those grounds were such as he had very little doubt would convince the majority of the house of the propriety of adopting the amendments he proposed. He had, indeed, never heard any serious objection urged against them. It therefore struck him as rather extraordinary, after the declared coincidence of the right hon. gent, to be told that some military officers entertained doubts upon the subject. No doubt was expressed by any person of that house; not a sentence of objection was heard from any member; and yet those salutary improvements, for the adoption of which policy, humanity, and justice equally called, were to be rejected or delayed, because some military officers doubted. How, he would ask, were the objections of such military persons to be brought before the house in a parliamentary form? and the mere statement of their objections, unaccompanied by any reason for such objections, was not, he contended, a parliamentary ground for the delay on the promotion of any measure. The time required in the opinion of the right hon. gent, to deliberate upon the propositions he had felt it his duty to recommend, was attainable in his judgment, with out proposing the alteration the right hon. gent, alluded to,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0369"/>
<col>709</col>
There was no necessity to hurry the bill through the house. This was only the 5th of the month, and there was yet time enough to pass it even should the right hon. gent. consent to postpone the third reading until some day next week. For himself, he must say, that he felt he was at present rather awkwardly circumstanced. He had declined to prepare the clauses he wished to introduce into the bill, relying that the right hon. gent, would bring them forward. The right hon. gent. would, however, he trusted, agree to postpone his motion; particularly as no inconvenience could result from such postponement. He also trusted that the right hon. gent. would not withhold his assistance from him in drawing up the necessary clauses; further, that the right hon. gent, would manfully maintain his declared opinion, and second his endeavours to promote the adoption of those clauses.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01491"><member>Colonel Stuart</member><membercontribution> thought the principle of the propositions recommended by the hon. officer ought to be carried farther, and that the degrees of punishment to be inflicted by regimental courts martial ought to be limited. The number of members on such courts martial ought, in his opinion, to be in no case less than 7, unless where a field officer presided, and, in such case, not less than 5. This was a regulation, which appeared to him highly necessary, but he particularly enforced the propriety of prohibiting the sentences of regimental courts martial from inflicting beyond a certain degree of punishment, not more than 2 or 300 lashes.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01492"><member>The Secretary at War</member><membercontribution> expressed his readiness to assist the right hon. officer in drawing up the clauses wish respect to the propositions he mentioned, and in which he perfectly concurred. He also assented to his wish for postponing the motion, and should therefore move the third reading on Monday next.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01493"><member>Sir Eyre Coote</member><membercontribution> cordially approved the propositions of the right hon. officer, and thought that no officer should be admitted a member of any court martial who was under 21 years of age. This alteration would, he was persuaded, be very grateful to the feelings and conducive to the interests of the army.&#x2014;The order for the third reading of the bill was postponed till Monday.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[SALT DUTY BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01494">On the motion that the Speaker do leave the chair; in order to go into a committee op the salt duty bill,</p>
<col>710</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01495"><member>Mr. Johnstone</member><membercontribution> rose, not, he said to-repeat the general arguments on this measure, which the house had heard so forcibly urged yesterday, but to call the attention of gentlemen to the operation of the salt tax in Scotland. When this tax was imposed in 1795, it was reduced in Scotland from 6s. 6d. to 4s. per bushel. This reduction took place in consequence of a consideration of the peculiar circumstances of the people of that country. Now, he wished to understand how it was proposed to draw the additional tax contained in this bill from a country so circumstanced. If in 1795 it was incapable of paying more than 4s. per bushel, why was it now deemed capable of affording 9s.? Considering, indeed, the situation of Scotland fully and fairly, it was his opinion that it. would be much wiser to remit the salt duty in that country altogether. That duty produced but 47,0001. per annum, and there was a bounty allowed from the excise amounting to 29,000l. which, with a considerable; bounty from the customs, exceeded the produce of the tax. For these reasons, he submitted, that a repeal of the duty as to Scotland would be not less advantageous, to the revenue than to the people of Scotland. If so, then, bow could ministers justify the imposition of a farther salt tax upon that country?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01496"><member>Mr. Huskisson</member><membercontribution> stated the reason for the former reduction of the salt tax in favour of Scotland to be this, that as the Scotch people manufactured their salt from sea water, they were subject to an increased expence for fuel. On that account this allowance was made, which it was still proposed to continue, and he contended, there, fore, that the people of Scotland had no reason to complain. As to the produce of the revenue arising from the salt duty in Scotland contrasted with the bounty, he admitted that it was not considerable; but then its reduced amount proceeded from the frauds that were known to exist, and the smuggling with Ireland, If, however, the hon. gent., would look into the, bill before the house, he would see that such provisions were introduced into it as were calculated effectually to prevent those frauds in future.&#x2014;A. division took place upon the motion, ayes, 128; noes, 58 5 rnajority,70.</membercontribution></p>

litary officers, below a certain rank, from the payment of this tax.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01499"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> announced his intention of opposing any proposition for the exemption of any class of men from this tax, as contrary to the spirit and equity of the measure, and calculated to undermine the whole contribution.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01500"><member>Sir John Newport</member><membercontribution> called the attention of the committee to this tax, as it affected the property in the funds, belonging to persons resident in Ireland. This, he conceived, to be contrary to the principle of the union, which, proposed to leave the resources of each country applicable to the treasury of that country. It would be also contrary to the policy which dictated an exemption in favour of the funded property of foreigners, which arose from a wish to induce foreigners to vest their money in our funds. The operation of this, tax with respect to persons resident in Ireland would, he observed, be still more severe, for this reason, that according to the act, the English agent would be obliged to make a return of the whole property of his principal, and thus the same person might be subject to the payment of the same tax in both countries. Under those circumstances, the hon. baronet proposed a clause to exempt from the tux such property in the funds as belonged to persons who pay the hearth money and the window tax in Ireland.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01501"><member>Mr. Alexander</member><membercontribution> did not think the object of the lion, baronet attainable in the, way he proposed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01502"><member>Sir John Newport</member><membercontribution> stated, that when he before mentioned the subject, he was told that the committee would be the proper place' to bring forward this proposition</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01503"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> observed, that the proposition of the hon. baronet could not be entertained, as no previous instruction to the committee had been voted. As to the proposition itself, he was surprised to hear it stated, that it involved a violation of the principle of the union. It was not less agreeable to that principle than to the precepts of common equity, that the property in each country should be subject to the taxation, and appropriate to the treasury of that country. This was precisely what this tax, objected to by the hon. bart. proposed; and, on the same principle, the property in the funds of Ireland, belonging, to persons resident in this country, would be subject to the taxation, and applicable to the purposes of that country, should it be through proper to lay a tak on
<col>712</col>
such funds. By the same parity of reasoning the land in each country would, incase of a land-tax, be subject to the tax imposed in that country. He recollected that the Irish parliament had laid an additional tax on the land of absentees; and therefore they proceeded upon quite a contrary principle to that on which the proposition of the hon. baronet was grounded: Indeed, he never heard of any project of exemption, similar to that proposed by the hon. baronet.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01504"><member>Sir John Newport</member><membercontribution> persisted in maintaining that it was contrary to the principle of the union to draw these resources from the use of Ireland which would be otherwise sent into it. Independently of this ground of objection, however, he claimed' the exemption he proposed, upon the same principle as that which induced the house to exempt the funded property of foreigners. Unless the property of the latter were deemed more sacred than that of the Irish, he saw no reason why this proposition should be resisted. If the hon. gent. should persist in opposing his object, he declared he would move to expunge from the bill the exemption in favour of foreigners.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01505"><member>Mr. Bankes</member><membercontribution> brought up a clause, to exempt from the payment of this tax all lands, money, or other property, vested in trustees for the use of almshouses, or other charitable purposes only.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01506"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, that he should shortly have occasion to move for leave to bring in another bill relating to regulations which would give his hon. friend an opportunity of submitting this exemption; but, if he thought proper to offer it now, he did not suppose it would meet with any opposition.&#x2014;The clause was then brought up and, agreed to, and the bill having passed the committed, was ordered to be reported to-morrow.</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01507"><member>Lord walsingham,</member><membercontribution> as chairman of the committee, to whom it was referred to consider of and investigate the various matters alleged in the charge against Mr. Justice Fox, came forward, pursuant to his notice of yesterday, and of a resolution of the committee. He adverted generally to the serious and uniform attention which the lords committees had paid to the important subject under their consideration; and
<image src="S1V0003P0I0371"/>
<col>713</col>
in which it was their wish to proceed in the most unexceptionable manner, as well with a reference to individual as to public justice. Under these considerations, the noble chairman moved to the following effect: "That the said committee be empowered to report from time to time, respecting the matters exhibited before them, and to state their opinions separately upon any of the articles of charge, if, on due examination thereof, they should find sufficient grounds for the same."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01508"><member>The Earl of Carlisle</member><membercontribution> expressed his disapprobation of the motion. He was adverse from the mode of offering any partial reports to the house upon the subject. He rather thought the committees should be instructed to withhold all reports until the whole of the charges against the accused should be gone through. The course generally adopted by grand juries would be the best to adopt in the present instance, which was to consider of, investigate, find, or throw out all the bills brought before them, instead of deciding upon any one, two, or three separate charges of what they might have to consider. He thought the duty imposed upon the committee, in the present instance, was similar to that which grand juries of the country had to fulfil. In considering the question then before the house, the situation of the accused, one of a very serious nature ought to be considered; the possibility of his being brought to the bar upon any one or two of the charges, while the rest may be pending or undecided, the situation of the accused person's mind, on such an occasion, was worthy of consideration. Added to this, was that of the contingency of his being voted guiltless of the particular charges reported to the house, and no opinion being subsequently stated, or decision made as to the remaining charges; a contingency, which, he thought, in point of fairness to the individual, as well as in justice to the public at large, ought to be seriously considered, and, in his opinion, was worthy of being made the subject of a specific motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01509"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> observed, that it was certainly irregular to allude, in the house, to what passed in discussion in a committed, otherwise he might particularly call to the recollection of the noble earl, that the resolution, on which the motion before the house was grounded, was not adopted without the most nature and de-
<col>714</col>
liberate consideration in the committee. The topic now regularly under consideration was by no means extensive, and its merits lay in a narrow compass. The motion referred not to any decision of the committee; it went to empower them, from time to time, to report their opinions upon any, or upon what charge, which they might deem of sufficient importance, to be brought under the consideration of the house, with a reference to a question, for the removal of the accused. The motion went not to bind, or in any way pledge, either the committee or the house, to any specific or particular line of proceeding. It would be for the committee hereafter to decide, whether or not they shall make a specific report on any particular charge, without going through the whole. It went to prejudice no point whatever, in consideration before the committee. Should they think any particular charge or charges weighty enough for a specific report, they would proceed accordingly. Neither would the house be affected by the motion; it would be at the option of the house, whether a proceeding at its bar should be adopted in consequence; or, upon its view of the charge, refer it back to the consideration of the committee, or call upon them to state their opinion upon all the charges; or whether a middle course should be adopted: these options would certainly rest in the house; and their agreeing to the motion of the noble chairman, would in no shape affect the proceedings, either in the way of convenience, or in reference to the consideration of private or public justice. The motion, therefore, which was unanimously approved in the committee, should have his decided support.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01510"><member>The Earl of Carlisle</member><membercontribution> spoke in explanation. He repeated his idea of the possibility of their lordships having, in consequence of the report of the committee upon some particular charge, to put the accused upon his trial; and, in the event of his being acquitted, and no opinion or decision being given or made, as to the other matters in charge, or, at least, in a way that such could go forth to the world; such a consideration may operate unfavourably with respect to the accused. In this point of view, he thought that some proceeding, obligatory upon the committee to go through the whole should be adopted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01511"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> thought the merits of the question now regularly before the house,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0372"/>
<col>715</col>
lay in a narrow compass. He had merely to express, his determination, that if he in the smallest degree apprehended that either the decision of the committee or the house, upon any particular point, with reference to the subject under the consideration of the former, were precluded or pledged by the motion, he certainly should not give his assent to it. No question, as to a report upon any particular charge being specifically made, or a thorough investigation of the whole, was prejudged by the motion. Neither would the house be in, the smallest degree precluded from entertaining the question of proceeding hereafter in any particular mode. Neither the house nor the committee would in the least degree be bound by the motion; a consideration which he thought it proper should be understood.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01512"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution> observed, that the noble lord who had just sat down had exactly expressed his sense of the question before the house. The committee were left at full liberty to proceed as they should think fit, and the house would retain its option to adopt or reject the opinion of the committee.&#x2014;The question was then put, and the motion carried.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[DISMISSALS FROM THE DOCK-YARDS.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01513"><member>Earl Fortescue</member><membercontribution> brought forward the motion, of which he had given notice on a former evening, upon this subject. The noble earl called to the recollection of the house the circumstance of the disturbances which took place in the county of Devon, in the spring of the year 1801; about which time, a species of mutiny existed in certain of his majesty's dock-yards. To these his attention had been called in his official capacity of lord lieutenant of that county; the then high prices of corn and other articles of provision were held out as the pretext, and, perhaps, might, in some degree, be the cause. In the course of the disturbances, several acts of violence took place, and it shortly appeared that the parties were actuated by motives distinct from those which had been held out as the pretexts. The contagion was spread to the dock-yards, where it operated in a manner the most dangerous. In its progress, plans of communication with the royal dock-yards in other quarters, and committees of correspondence were established, for the purpose of enforcing the claims of the refractory artificers, He had done whatever lay in his power to satisfy those persons, and to allay the dis-
<col>716</col>
turbances; it was, however, at the same time, obviously proper to proceed with the utmost caution, and under the circumstances of the case, he had deemed it expedient to communicate to his majesty's ministers what observations he had made, and the impression left upon his mind. The communication was officially made in the first instance to a noble duke, then at the head of the home department. It was the wish of the government to avail itself of his local Knowledge upon the occasion; he accordingly gave every information upon the subject in his power. It was not his intention then to take up their lordships' time, neither did he think it would be regular to enter into any details of the transactions alluded to, or notices of the correspondence; at length he received notice from a noble earl, now in his place, and then at the head of the board of admiralty, that a commission had been appointed to enquire into the proceedings in question; and thoroughly investigating the circumstances of the case; the result of these enquiries was, as he understood, the dismissal from his majesty's dock-yards of more than one hundred persons. He had left all his documents upon the subject in the country, not imagining the subject would ever again be revived. He therefore could not speak precisely, but the number he believed was from one hundred to an hundred and twenty; these men were discharged, and the measure was followed up by sending the names of the culprits to all the other king's, and even to the merchants' dock-yards, in order, as he should imagine, that they should not be received or employed in them. But he afterwards learned, and he had no reason to doubt the truth of his information, that several of the dismissed artificers had been received into his majesty's dock-yards. He must take it for granted, that the dismissal proceeded upon strong and cogent grounds, with out which, a step, which might otherwise appear tinctured with cruelty and inhumanity, would not, he believed, be taken. He did not mean to propose any specific proceeding as to the affair in question; but he held it as a part of his public duty, to call the attention of parliament to the fact he had adverted to. He was the farther induced to this, when he recollected the confidence reposed in him on the occasion; by the noble earl then at the head of the admiralty, even under his own responsibility. He repeated
<image src="S1V0003P0I0373"/>
<col>717</col>
his opinion, that neither the noble earl, nor any of those respectable persons, who constituted the board, over which he presided would deprive the individuals in question of their situations, without strong and adequate grounds. He was persuaded it had been the result of diligent investigation and a conviction, that the continuance of such persons in their situations was, so far, incompatible with the public safety. Under these impressions, he had called their lordships' attention to the circumstance, and should beg leave simply to move, 1st. That a list of the names of such artificers as were discharged by the commissioners of naval enquiry in April 1801, in consequence of a mutiny then existing, be laid before the house. And 2dly. A list of the names of such artificers as may have entered into his majesty's dock-yards, as they have respectively reentered."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01514"><member>Lord Melville</member><membercontribution> apologised for his absence yesterday. He had been, he observed, but of town, and had not heard of the noble earl's intended motion, in time to arrive at the proper hour yesterday. He hoped their lordships would deem him incapable of any thing that might, however remotely, appear disrespectful, either to their lordships in general, or to any individual peer; more especially on a question in which, to a certain degree, his own conduct might appear to be implicated. Upon the motion of the noble earl, after what he had perused, he had little to say, as it was not his intention to resist, substantially, the production of what was required; and, for reasons similar to those assigned by the noble earl, he should refrain from entering into any detailed considerations of what had been referred to. In doing this, he felt but one reluctance, which was, that, as the noble earl had avoided speaking of himself as little as possible, in which he followed the same line which had distinguished all his life, he should have no opportunity of reciting circumstances, which would redound so greatly to the noble earl's honour, in his capacity of lord lieutenant of the county of Devon. In another point of view, he was of opinion, that, to enter into the details alluded to, would be improper, as it might produce mischief, but could possibly produce no good. Upon that ground, if any thing had dropped from the noble earl, tending to shew a disposition to make the result a subject of farther enquiry or
<col>718</col>
proceeding, he should have taken the liberty to ask the noble lord what his intentions on that head were; as he might, according to that answer, find it his duty to lay other documents for the perusal of their lordships, and to enable them fully to understand the subject. His only reason for making these allegations at present was, that if, after the required information should be laid before the house, any farther motion or proceeding should take place in consequence, he should reserve to himself the power of moving for any other documents that he might conceive necessary for the full illustration of the subject. With respect to the substance of the motion now before their lordship's, he repeated he had no desire to oppose it; but he deemed it necessary to suggest an alteration in its wording, and which he thought, would be better calculated to obtain the information desired. The names of the individuals should not be recited. The purpose would be as fully answered, if the respective trades and occupations of the individuals in question were specified. Their lordships would conceive, that these persons were dispersed in different dock-yards, and in several parts of the kingdom, if at all in the country. It would answer no good purpose, he thought, to hold forth the names of such individuals, as culprits, guilty of offences years ago, whose conduct since, might be sober, orderly, and unobjectionable. The number of such persons as might have so re-entered, would answer without a specification of their names. He also was inclined to object to the word 'mutiny' in the motion. As the general charge against these persons might be classed under two beads: the first, that of combination for a permanent increase of pay, the appointment of delegates, &amp;c.; the second, for the share they had in those disturbances, in the shape of sedition, which then prevailed in several parts of Devonshire; though it was then deemed expedient to consolidate both considerations into one general charge. Modelled in the way he described, he had no objection to the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01515"><member>Earl St. Vincent</member><membercontribution> expressed his opinion, that the considerations adverted to by the noble earl were of great importance, and the country was highly indebted to him for his conduct upon the occasion; were it not for the temperate and firm tone of his measures, the whole county of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0374"/>
<col>719</col>
Devon would have been, he believed, not only in a state of disturbance, but in actual rebellion. At the same time it was fair to say, that the exertions of the noble earl were very well and effectually seconded by lieut. gen. Simcoe and other officers. It was well known to the noble lord on the woolsack, and to the secretaries of state, that what he then asserted was founded in truth.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01516"><member>Earl Fortescue</member><membercontribution> spoke in explanation. He came forward entirely from a sense of public duty. With respect to the objection of the noble viscount, he was inclined to believe, that the names of many of the individuals would not be accurately set forth. Persons so circumstanced were not unfrequeutly in the habit of changing their names. He did not think the proposed alteration of much importance, and therefore had no objection to the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01517"><member>Earl St. Vincent</member><membercontribution> seemed to think the proposed alteration would make a very material difference. The names were important to be specified, as without them it was morally impossible their lordships could be accurately informed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01518"><member>Lord Melville</member><membercontribution> then moved, as amendments to the motion, that the words "of the names of" be left out, and to insert the words "of the number of, together with the respective trades and occupations," in their room; and also a corresponding amendment in the second part of the motion. These amendments were agreed to by their lordships, who ordered the information, as specified in the amended motion, to be laid before the house.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[IRISH HABEAS CORPUS SUSPENSION BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01519"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> generally called the attention of their lordships to the subject of which the measure of suspending the Habeas Corpus act in Ireland formed so prominent a part. He adverted to the circumstance of the bill being rapidly passed through that house, and contended, that sufficient information, or grounds, had pot been laid before the house, for the enactment of such a measure; a branch of the information, which, on glancing at the general subject, he conceived necessary, respected the transactions which had not long since taken place at the prison of Kilmainham. His lordship then in substance moved, that there be laid before the house a copy of the depotions of certaiin prisoners confined in the gaol of Kilmanham, taken before three judges of his majesty's court of king's bench in Ireland, who sat in the
<col>720</col>
said prison for that purpose, on the 16th and 17th days of July last.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01520"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> expressed his wish, that the noble baron would postpone the motion, for a short time, as at present he was not prepared to say whether or not he ought to object to it. It was one of that particular nature, as obviously required some previous consideration or inquiry. He, therefore, wished his lordship would not press it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01521"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> replied, he thought the subject matter of the motions was of a nature so clearly unobjectionable, as that he was surprised any opposition could be offered to it. He recollected what transpired on his recently agreeing to postpone another motion. For the present he seemed inclined to press it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01522"><member>Lord Hawkesbury,</member><membercontribution> in explanation, begged the noble baron to recollect that the motion alluded to as postponed was so deferred as his own act. On the present occasion, feeling that he was not prepared to give a decided opinion as to the merits of the motion, he would move the house to adjourn.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01523"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution> said a few words in support of what had fallen from his noble friend. The question of adjournment was then put.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01524"><member>Lord Grenville</member><membercontribution> rose, and defended the observations of his noble friend. He considered the information required by the motion as unobjectionable, and necessary to be laid before the house; with a reference to the extraordinary powers vested in government by the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act in Ireland, there could exist no doubt, that what had appeared, on an inquiry so constituted as that specified in the motion, was fit to be laid before that house. He thought it hard, when that part of the united kingdom was deprived of the benefit of the Habeas Corpus Act, that all relevant information, as hitherto called for, should be withheld. Were these denials persisted in, it would look as if they were inclined to abandon all constitutional controul on the exercise of such extraordinary powers as were now vested in ministers. They refused even to consider the state of the jails in that part of the united kingdom&#x2014;a consideration they ware the more bound to do, as connected with an act recently passed by themselves.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01525"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution> observed, no man could possibly lament the necessity of suspending the Habeas Corpus act more than
<image src="S1V0003P0I0375"/>
<col>721</col>
he did, nor could be more willing than himself to have every degree of proper information afforded. He, therefore, wished it to be understood, that, in supporting the motion for an adjournment that night, he by no means wished to oppose the production of any information whatever that ought to be given; but, that he only sought for an opportunity of informing himself whether the information required in the present instance was such as ought to he given.&#x2014;His lordship then referred to the wording of the motion, particularly those words, "who sat for <i>that</i> purpose," from which, he could not collect for <i>what</i> purpose it was the sitting in question was held. The production required might involve the disclosure of circumstances, which, for a time at least, it may be highly necessary to keep secret, as information respecting traitorous conspiracies, &amp;c.: the delay till to-morrow could at any rate make no difference, it would only give his majesty's ministers an opportunity of ascertaining, whether the depositions in question were or not of a nature fit to be laid before parliament: they wished only for an opportunity of knowing what line of conduct was proper to be pursued on the occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01526"><member>The Earl of Derby</member><membercontribution> expressed his opinion, that the positions advanced by the noble and learned lord, and his noble friend opposite to him, were as extraordinary positions as he had ever heard advanced in that house. It was the duty of ministers, particularly of the secretary of state for the home department, to be so informed with respect to subjects like that in question, as to be able to declare, at the moment, whether the motion was objectionable or not. It was extraordinary to see a secretary of state not informed upon such an occasion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01527"><member>Lord Hawkesbury,</member><membercontribution> in reply to the animadversions of the noble earl, insisted that the house was placed in a very extraordinary situation, by the conduct of the noble baron, in the present instance. Though not called for by their lordships orders, yet, in common courtesy to the house, a motion, which obviously called for consideration or enquiry, should not be passed, unless previous notice of it had been given. Such a motion as the present, he contended, required time to consider whether, under all the circumstances of the case, it should be agreed to or not. Time should be afforded for consulting with those whom it
<col>722</col>
may be the duty of ministers on such subjects to recur to for information and advice. In proposing to adjourn, he meant not, in his present view of the subject, to oppose the motion it was, in fact, urging a request that it might be put off, so as to afford even a short interval for consideration. Such a course, he thought, should be adopted, with all questionable propositions, which were brought forward and urged without previous notice. He meant not to offer the least opinion as to the motion of the noble lord; but he thought that, independent of the merits of a question, the pressing of a motion without notice, as in the present case, was sufficient ground for urging an adjournment. The question was then put; lord Hawkesbury's motion agreed to; and an adjournment accordingly took place.</membercontribution></p>

The prosecutions alluded to took their rise in the year 1784, when Ireland became disordered, and the several counties inadequate to the expence of carrying on criminal prosecutions within them. The sum of 12,000l. was then granted. In 1797 it was extended to 17,000l. In 1798, when the rebellion broke out, it increased to 20,0001.; and in 1800 a grant was obtained for 25,000l. which had ever since continued, and six crown solicitors had been appointed for carrying on such prosecutions. He thought the whole was a total misapplication of the public money, and that each county should be bound, as formerly, to pay the expences of their own prosecutions.&#x2014;Mr. Foster argued in favour of the grant, and stewed the hardship that would devolve on particular counties, where insurrections or public crimes might prevail, if the expences were not defrayed at the public charge.&#x2014;Mr. Fitzgerald renewed his former objections; but said, he had no objection to the motion, provided it were confined to prosecutions for stale offences. He therefore moved that, after the word "prosecutions," be added the words, "in cases of high treason, or for treasonable practices."&#x2014;The gallery was ordered to be cleared, but no division took place. The amendment being put and negatived, the original motion was put and agreed to.</p>

<title>[REPEAL OF THE ADDITIONAL FORCE BILL.]&#x2014;</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01530"><member>Mr. Sheridan</member><membercontribution> rose, and spoke nearly to the following effect:&#x2014;I rise, sir, in pursuance of the notice I gave, on a former day, to submit to the house a motion for the repeal of a bill, passed last session of parliament, intituled, "an act for the additional defence of the kingdom, &amp;c." I choose to give the whole of the title of this bill, rather than to be studious of brevity, though it might certainly give me an opportunity of complimenting the feelings of the right hon. gent. by describing it in its usual appellation, as Mr. Pitt's parish defence bill. When I gave my notice of this motion, I could not help observing, that it appeared to excite some surprise on the part of some gentlemen opposite; a surprise not unmixed with marks of disapprobation of a nature not the most orderly. I have been endeavouring to account for these symptoms of surprise and disapprobation. Did the hon. gentlemen
<col>724</col>
conceive that my notice arose merely from the thought of the moment; from being piqued at the right hon. gent's silence; from the loss of a debate on the occasion of the motion of my right hon. friend on this side of the house (Mr. Windham)? Did they imagine that we considered the speech of my right hon. friend, al speech in which so full, so able, and so luminous a view of the subject was taken, was so feebly sustained, and so ably and completely answered by a right hon. friend of mine on the opposite bench (Mr. Canning), that we wished for a little time to rally and get breath before we renewed the attack? Or did those hon. gentlemen conceive it to be extremely disrespectful to the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, who appeared to be so reluctant and so bashful when an attempt was made to bring him to take a part in a discussion, that I should strive to force him into another opportunity of a similar kind? I do pot doubt, sir, that it must have been most unpleasant to those gentlemen to have seen their right hon. friend wincing and writhing under the masterly and unanswerable speech of my right hon. friend. Yet, though they may think it uncourteous in us to force him to an explanation, we prefer adopting that course which we think right, without regarding the feelings of the right hon. gent. It may perhaps be considered superfluous to add any thing upon a subject which has been so ably handled by my right hon. friend. That nothing more can be said upon it than he has said I am perfectly aware. I do confess that the whole I have to say has been anticipated by him. The whole of the details were gone through by him in so masterly a manner, that but little more can be added. But if, in the course of that speech of my right hon. friend, which invited the house to a general review of the military state of the country, he clearly shewed that this statute, on which it was founded, was a scandalous statute, and a disgrace to your statute book, it was natural that some person should move to repeal it. If the causes to which I have referred were not the inducements to that surprise and disapprobation which were exhibited on a former, day, I can suggest but one more cause. Perhaps it excited some degree of surprise, that I should be the person to move for the repeal of an act that professed to have been passed for the defence of the country. It has been very much the fashion to say,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0377"/>
<col>725</col>
when you oppose any of the measures of government, that you are damping the spirit of the country, that you are holding out hopes and allurements to the enemy. Sir, if I thought that, in any one instance, the motion I have to submit could in the smallest degree distress the country; that it could in any view discourage the heart, and feelings, and energy of those who defend the country; that it could throw the slightest ignominy or slur on those whose duty it is to collect the materials for the defence of the country, I would be one of the last men in the world to bring forward such a motion. How my motion will be treated. I am wholly at a loss to conjecture. The right hon. gent. opposite me thought fit on a former night to preserve a regular, persevering, and dignified silence. The duty of answering the right hon. mover was performed by a right hon. friend, (Mr. Canning) for whom I really entertain a very great respect. I speak seriously. I am to conclude that he was very well contented with his own speech. If he was contented with it, all I can say is, that he is a gentleman who is very easily contented. Certainly, out of doors, it has been said that the speech of my right hon. friend was a complete answer to the motion; but, whatever may have been said or thought out of doors, I am sure it was not thought so by any one member within doors, and least of all by my right hon. friend himself. I profess the highest admiration of his talents, but I declare I never saw him so labour and flounder upon any subject before. He seemed to be struggling against wind and tide, clapping up a bit of sail to catch every little puff of applause from behind him; and sometimes compelled to take to his sweeps. He was obliged to make his speech noisy, because he knew he could not make it convincing, and he uniformly raised his voice in proportion as he dropped his argument; No man, I am sure, felt the disadvantage of the cause he was labouring more than he did himself: It was a speech of the Catamaran species, plenty of noise and little mischief; I mean mischief to those it was intended to annoy, but what damage it may have done to those it was intended to support, is more than I can pretend to say.&#x2014;Having endeavoured so far to stand' right with the house in the view I have taken of the state of the last debate, am I to be considered presumptous in following Up the motion

of my right hon. friend, by another motion to repeal the defence act, in which it is my intention chiefly to confine myself to the military part of it, and to the object I wish to press upon the house, of shewing the inefficiency of the measure, and the absolute necessity of repealing it altogether. If any persons expect any sport or diversion from any difference of sentiment or contradiction between me and other gentlemen who may side with me to-night, they will, I believe, be disappointed. In truth, the difference between me and those gentlemen is by no means so wide as has been represented on this subject. Where I differ from them, I am, not disposed to conceal my opinions; I shall ever be ready to state them openly and frankly. I have thought, and I do still think, most highly of the institution of the volunteer system. I think that system has been most useful and admirable. I am convinced, from authorities which I cannot for a moment dispute, that it has had a very powerful effect on the minds of our avowed and inveterate enemy. I believe that its success in this country struck a considerable panic into the mind of our enemy. What the conviction of the new emperor of France, what the opinion of Bonaparte may be, I cannot exactly tell, but I am sure it must have had some effect upon him. I am convinced that nothing more strongly impressed his minister for foreign affairs, Talleyrand, and the people of any consideration in general in France, than that this banking, luxurious, mercantile people, were not contented with lolling on the couch of indolence, and trusting to others to fight their battles; that they were not contented with putting their hands in their pockets, in order to raise an army of mercenaries to protect them, but that they trusted to themselves, and their own energy and spirit; that whether they had skill or not, they had the courage and the disposition to defend the country. If you call on government to have an army, be it of what amount it may, your enemy knows its full extent, and the means of meeting that army may be matte the subject of calculation; but when a nation has shewn such a spirit as this has, no enemy can calculate what it may produce. No one can say where the exertions of a nation will stop, when roused into action by an honourable determination and will to defend to the last every thing that is dear and valu

able.&#x2014;While, sir, I thus admire the noble institution of the volunteer system, I must also own that I am not a friend to any very material diminution of the militia force. I am sure that the principle of that force is a sound one, and I know that it is popular among all ranks. It is one to which the opinions, and feelings, and habits of the people, have been long accustomed, I do not see that there is any very serious evil in having a force consisting of some variety of descriptions. I must own that I dislike putting our trust altogether in an army raised on the principle of hire. No country of which history speaks has ever maintained long her honour, her prosperity, and her liberty, by trusting merely to an army consisting wholly of hired soldiers.&#x2014;Still, however, I expect to be told, Chat by bringing forward such a motion as this, I am degrading the country. But I say, I am only shewing the failure of a boasted experiment. I say, it has completely failed. What was the promise of the right hon. gent.? 'What my predecessors could not do, I will perform. They were unworthy of being trusted. Give me your perfect confidence.' They must be hurled from their places as persons of imbecility and total inability, though they had seen in their time some accession to the national force. They saw almost a million and a half of men in arms, they saw the country half-martial throughout its population; yet so wretched and imbecile and insignificant were they, that they could not, in the estimation of the right hon gent, go on any longer. 'Let me come,' says the right hon. gent. 'Clear away all the rubbish. I will come, and set every thing to rights.' Well, sir, I comes: and when I comes, what does I do? Why I does nothing half so good, nor half so vigorous, as the much-abused and stupid ministers that were turned out to make way for him. Why, now sir, I wish to expose to the country the nature of the imposture. Has not the country been imposed upon? Is not the effect of this defence bill a proof of the imposition practised upon it? Are these new ministers worthy of the places they have contrived to push themselves into by the changes that have been made? But then they all cry out, 'O! it is dangerous and shocking to tell the country that, the bill has failed! It may damp public spirit and depress the national energies. Let us conceal it, let us keep it quiet, let us keep it snug amongst ourselves!' To say that they who dispossessed another
<col>728</col>
set of ministers of their places for alledged incapacity, and brought in a bill on which to found their claims to pre-eminence, had found their bill ineffectual, and even worse on the. comparison; to say that the great man's measure has failed, and that a bill to raise men has been converted into a mere bill to raise money by the most objectionable means, has been converted into a most odious tax bill; why that, it seems, would be to dispirit and destroy the patriotism and energy of the nation, it would ruin the necessary confidence in the government of the country. The country has often heard of flourishing statements of the numbers of the regular army to a great amount, though it has turned out to be only a statement on paper; but the delusion in the present instance will not do. Any, attempt to make it succeed, must be as absurd and stupid as the bill itself. It is not a measure in which the people are only to judge of a matter in which they are not the actors. No, sir, all the people know what is going on; they are behind, the scenes; they are under the apron of this famous puppet-shew. Every one of them has something to do in the business. They have to pull the wires and the strings of the machine. You won't make them believe they have raised men, when they know they have raised none. There seems to be three simple points on which this question turns. First, has this bill failed or not? Secondly, if it has failed, is it likely, by continuing in operation, to atone for its failure by future success? And, thirdly, is the experiment itself mischievous and dangerous? Here the house will not fail to recollect, that this was a measure recommended to us, not as a flow and progressively operating scheme, which, in process of time, should improve the military force of the country, and perfect the means of-raising a regular army. No, sir, it was a scheme pressed upon the house, at a time when its great author spoke of nothing but of counting, not months and weeks, but days and hours, whenever the necessities and the dangers of the country were to be considered. It was a plan by which a quick and unprecedented addition of force was to be made far army, far exceeding any thing that our the silly, weak administration were capable of effecting. It was to give us, and to give at speedily, the means; of resisting, all foreign efforts, and of enabling us to repel that torrent of liquid fire about to be
<image src="S1V0003P0I0379"/>
<col>729</col>
poured out on this nation, and to retort upon the proud and daring invader, all the horrors with which, in the intoxication of his insolence, he had dared to menace us.&#x2014;It has been said by some persons, that my right hon. friend, who introduced this subject this session, treated it with considerable levity, and that from the abundance of his merriment, it is not possible to believe that he was really serious in his representation of the very deficient state of the military measures pursued by the present ministers. There are Some things, sir, that are of such a description as must infallibly awaken the sense of ridicule; 'Ridiculum acri quid vetat.' When, after being listened to attentively, and the means afforded him unsparingly, the boaster fails egregiously in every one of his grand and vaunted projects, the sense of ridicule is irresistibly excited. What did he promise? Was it a mere measure of finance? No such thing! It was a measure for the raising of men for military service. The only hope of service that any man can expect from the bill, is quite different from the object held out to the house and the country at the introduction and passing of it. If you were to contract for a certain number of excellent horses to mount a corps of light artillery upon, and your contractor brought, instead of them, an equal number of stout, orderly, well-behaved oxen, could you mount your light artillery upon them, or would you think he had performed his promise, and complied with the terms or the spirit of his contract? In order to try whether the right hon. gent. has failed or not in his lofty and extensive promises to the house, it is necessary to touch but lightly on mere matters of figures, Since the particulars have been already so ably detailed to you, and commented upon. On this point your attention ought to be directed to the general statements of your military force. And here it strikes one, at the very outset, that it is asserted by some gentlemen, that even a failure on the part of the present administration in their performances, is very different from a failure on the part of the late ministers. It is nothing like so bad and so dangerous, because, say they, our force is upon the whole so considerably increased; and the right hon. gent, himself seemed, when the subject was first mentioned, to pant after the time when he might have the opportunity of shewing it. My right hon. friend
<col>730</col>
opposite (Mr. Canning) says, that our navy has been augmented by the number of no less than 50 ships of war. Sir, I deny it. We have not one more effective ship of war, nor an atom more of actual efficient naval force, than we had under the last naval administration. But it would appear that there is something so very peculiar in the composition of the present administration, as to challenge and to command such an especial and unbounded degree of confidence, that no man shall presume to say that any thing in the shape of enquiry is at all necessary. On the subject of their superior claims to the confidence of this house and the public, I shall say a little more by and bye. I must, however observe, that the change, as it respects a claim for confidence, has, indeed, altered circumstances, but has altered them very much for the worse. I shall now shew from a short review of the returns on the table, what the exertions of the right hon. gent. have produced for the army, and how the country has reason to feel from the change which placed the right hon. gent. in power.

From the documents altogether, there results an augmentation of the whole body of the army of only 11,000 men, making the whole difference between the returns of force of the two years, and consequently the sum of the efforts of the present administration. But you are to consider, that of the increase, 7000 men are in the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0380"/>
<col>731</col>
foreign corps, and 4000 in the cavalry. We find, however, that in the British infantry, there is a deficiency of 856 men. Surely the Ceylon, troops are not in fairness to be reckoned. Indeed, augmentation in that quarter cannot justly be taken into the account for ministers, since, with the increase of distant territories, it becomes a matter of necessity to increase the troops. To call this an actual extension of your disposable force, is a downright fallacy. But what we do find, sir, is this; that there is a positive decrease in that particular branch of the military force, which it was the peculiar and boasted object of this bill to increase. To what was this bill particularly to apply? Was it to the raising of troops at Ceylon? Was it to Black Corps? Was it to an addition of German Legions? No! it was to augment greatly the numbers of the British infantry. Has it done so? Has it produced the promised and desired augmentation? No! And if there be any increase upon the whole, it is not the right hon. gent but it is his predecessor, who has the right to claim the merit. It is he who was at the head of that "wretched, incapable, nauseous, milk-and-water administration," with whose laurels the right hon. gent, attempts to adorn himself. I must therefore say, that gentlemen should be inclined to retract those severe and taunting expressions against the late administration, on a comparison of their merits with those of the present ministers. I know it was said, that let those ministers go when they would, worse could not follow. Some others, as well as myself, were of a different opinion. We thought that worse could follow, and we think now that worse have followed them. We may now presume to think, that we were then in the right. We said, infinitely worse may succeed them, who will perform their promises much worse, And keep far less good faith with this house and with the country. By what means have they raised the increase of 4000 horse, but by the raising of men for rank? Did the present ministers introduce that? No! And the same remark holds good as to the foreign corps. Whatever merit, therefore, is ascribable to any person for the augmentation of our military force, is not at all owing to the right hon. gent. or his boasted bill, but it is owing to the noble lord now at the head of his majesty's councils. Perhaps I have made a mistake. I mean the noble lord, now president of the
<col>732</col>
council. I don't know whether he is at the head of his majesty's councils or not; that might be a mistake; I don't enquire into that matter. It is not now of material consequence, whether he is so, or is not. But I do say, that if any thing has been done to enable the right hon. gent. to make any grand exploit, any attack on the enemy's possessions, the merit is not due to him, but to lord Sidmouth.&#x2014;Whatever returns may appear from the right hon. gent's. own bill, they can have no effect. But it is most ludicrously clear that his bill has failed, completely failed! And sir, what does appear? Why, it appears that the 52 counties of England and Wales have jointly, under the operation of this formidable additional force act, produced 1,295 men; that out of this number there have deserted, or have been discharged, 266 men, leaving 1,079 effective soldiers; and it further appears, that out of this number raised throughout all England, by the most extraordinary means; by all those grand efforts, of which we have heard so much; by local influence and attachments; by sympathetic feelings, and a thousand other operations, assisted and enforced by justices and churchwardens, and all descriptions of parish officers, I suppose not less than 40,000 men altogether, there have been procured no more than 342 men to enter for general service; that is to say, the right hon. gent. has, with all his machinery, been enabled to raise after the rate of four men and a quarter for each county in England&#x0153; In Scotland, it seems, 267 men have been procured, out of which 43 have gone for general service. In Ireland, where the parish officers alone have done this business, they have got 1081; but there, sir, the zeal has stopped. I do not find that one of these has entered for general service. It does appear, from a particular examination of the whole matter, upon abundant proof, that the parish officers are much worse agents, with all the local and sympathetic engines, for raising men for the army, than the regimental recruiters. It appears that they have not been so solicitous to give the king a good soldier, as they have been to get rid of a vagrant. Hence, in Lancashire there have been 255 deficient by desertion or otherwise. Where the right hon. gentleman's own influence was particularly directed, 11 men were procured, all of whom deserted, and in that particular district where his
<image src="S1V0003P0I0381"/>
<col>733</col>
own authority and popularity are so abounded, where all the people admire him as a general, as much as they venerate him as a politician and a statesman, I mean the Cinque-ports, the spot of his own residence, he has contrived so far to stimulate martial policy as to have been able to raise one man! ac ille leo est! I wish we could get a look at this extraordinary man. He must be a very Hercules. He is an extraordinary recruit indeed! This reminds me of the story of lord Donegal's troop of light horse. When a certain general asked where lord Donegal's troop of light horse were, a man rode up, and said, 'I am lord Donegal's troop.' So, if you ask where the parish volunteers are, out steps a man from the Cinque ports, and says, ',Here I am.' Really, sir, if ever there was a bill introduced into parliament which was calculated to bring to disgrace its author, it is this miserable measure. However we may differ in subdivisions here, we can have but one heart and one mind in defending the country; but to pause about continuing this bill is what I cannot account for; it is a cheat, an imposition. You come into a parish and you say, 'Give me a soldier.' The parish officer says, 'I can't; I have not got one.' You then turn round, like an impudent bully, and tell him, 'Very well, then, if you don't put twenty pounds in a certain place, I shall find a way of making you.' To those who complain so much of the parish officers not having done their duty under this bill, I would ask why the privy council did not set them a good example, by doing their duty? Had the privy council done so, the proclamation of lord Hawkesbury would not have been delayed so long. From this instance of neglect in the privy council I should think it would, be necessary in any future acts, where that council should have any duty to execute, that a clause should be inserted to inflict a penalty upon them for neglect. As to the double penalty threatened on the parishes which are deficient under this act, I think the collection of it would not be less difficult than oppressive.&#x2014;But now it is said, you have not given the bill a fair chance&#x2014;give it a full trial&#x2014;wait a moment. I say we have waited long enough. It was a bill which professed to raise expeditiously a great force. Has it done so? No&#x2014;the time is over; then why give it a: longer trial? To elucidate this by a comparison. We have heard a
<col>734</col>
good deal respecting the different modes of conveying men by land carriage. Suppose a schemer was to say, "all these plans are good for nothing; they will not answer; you cannot depend upon them. Look at my plan; I will convey you 20 men to Windsor and back again in six hours." Suppose any of us were to be so foolish as to listen to this schemer, and to destroy all our old machines, expecting he would perform his promise. "Well," says the projector, "now get in twenty of your infantry, knapsacks, baggage, arms, accoutrements and all, I'll bring you back in six hours, depend upon it." We believe him, and after waiting six hours we hear he is at Kensington. That's something&#x2014;we suppose he is coining back with the troops&#x2014;no such thing&#x2014;we find that he has got no further&#x2014;in fact, that he has not travelled more than half a mile an hour. Why, what should we think if he was to say&#x2014;"O, but you must give me time, I have not had a fair trial?" Or suppose a man, seeing me using a blunderbuss, was to say to me&#x2014;"Take away that clumsy gun, you shall try mine with a fine hair trigger "&#x2014;I receive it from him&#x2014;it misses fire&#x2014;"Never mind," says the man, "give it time, keep it to your shoulder, it only hangs iire."&#x2014;"I do keep it to my shoulder, but still it wont go off." If it hung fire only for a moment or two, it might not signify much, but I should think I had been grossly imposed upon, if I had been persuaded to change my blunderbuss for a gun with a hair trigger that hung fire for six months. Really, sir, the mode of proceeding adopted by gentlemen opposite, upon this bill, is something like laughing at the house. They had better call it a tax bill at once, and defend it on that ground, though that was never professed to be its object. If it will not do for one thing, it may do for another. If it cannot attain its intended object, it will serve for a different one. It is giving us what does not answer the purpose it professed. It is like giving a man a sword and a shield, the former of which is unfit for offence, and the latter for defence, and then consoling him, by saying, "Never mind, your sword will make an excellent soup ladle, and your shield an admirable fish kettle." Now, it is just the. same thing with the right hon. gent.'s bill. It won't answer for recruiting the British army, but it may be a notable finance measure. But pray do not venture to say, that for all its professed ends, it has not
<image src="S1V0003P0I0382"/>
<col>735</col>
totally failed. My right hon. friend opposite (Mr. Canning) thought we were in such a state as entitled us to overlook this failure; arid he wished us to see the increased state of our naval force. Now, I say, we have not added one man to the efficient force of the military department of our navy. I say, that in that point we are not equal to the state in which Earl St. Vincent, the late first lord of the Admiralty, left us. The force he left us, I assert, was superior to our present force, for the protection of our trade, and for the annoyance and chastisement of our enemies. If you examine impartially and carefully all this trash of 50 additional ships of war, you will find more than 30 of them old broken-down West-India vessels, and others of a similar description, bought in the river. One of them got to the Downs, but could not keep the sea any longer; another, a fifty-gun ship, an old West-Indian, was broken-backed in the river, and was reported in that state, but was purchased nevertheless, and others of them are still in the river. One went out neither fit to go to sea nor to ride at anchor. She went without her convoy, not because they could not keep up with her, but because she was quite unmanageable. It will also appear on inquiry that the present Admiralty board, has ordered the purchase of some West Indiamen in the river, which were reported to that board to be incapable of being made fit for use at the time of the purchase, and which were still lying in the river. Such are the ships of war which the present vigorous Admiralty have added to our fleet, and they have against that addition reduced it by dismantling 7 ships of the line and several frigates. By the bye, as a sample of the wisdom of building vessels of war in merchants dock yards, which the right hon. gent, once so strongly recommended, all those dismantled vessels had been so built, and not one of them had been in use above 7 years. The addition of men alleged to be made to the naval service, under the present Admiralty, does not exceed 5000. When you take the slight trouble of considering what was the great increase made by the noble earl during his administration of naval affairs, and compare it with what has been done since, after all the boast that was made, and all the charges you beard, the performances of the present administration sink to ridicule. Why does net the right hon. gent. put his assertions
<col>736</col>
to the test? Why does he not bring forward an examination of the conduct of the late board of admiralty? While he refuses to come to that test, bow unjustifiable is it in him, to state in this house, to the prejudice of that gallant veteran officer, that all he has heard, and all he has read, and all he has seen, have convinced hint of the justice and propriety of the accusations be made, when he arraigned in this house the conduct of the noble earl's naval administration? On this subject I do not wish to say any more at present. But I must observe, that if the evil hour should ever come when government shall find it necessary to call on that noble and gallant admiral again to hoist his flag, not more for the terror and dismay of our foes, than for the benefit of his example throughout the British navy, by his skill and valour, and his strict observance of that discipline which is so essentially necessary to the existence of our fleets, and of which he himself is so decided an instance in his own rigorous observance and his self-devotion to the service, they will be deeply and solemnly responsible for having sent out that naval hero with all the impressions they have made by endeavours to lower his character in the eyes of the navy, calumniated, and half disgraced, and disheartened (as far as they could), to the fleet, with the name of a harsh, a rigorous, and an oppressive tyrant.&#x2014;Having said so much as to the matter and the effects of this bill, I beg to say a word upon the bill itself. In looking over it, every clause seems to be drawn up with a characteristic degree of confidence. It states, first, that whereas it is necessary to raise 85,000 men; it proposes to raise that number within the year. On the next year it proposes to raise as many men as shall be necessary to supply the deficiencies occasioned in the additional force, &amp;c. by enlistments for general service. Afterwards, the bill becomes somewhat moderate, and promises to supply substitutes only for 9,000 men each year, which is the estimated amount of enlistment for general service, and the substitutes are not to exceed that number. But the most curious part of this curious bill is, that the parish officers are restrained from procuring men beyond a certain distance from their respective parishes, while the regular recruiting officer, who is to provide the men in case the parishes fail, is at liberty to procure those men wherever he can get them. Another sin-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0383"/>
<col>737</col>
gular thing in the act is, that it is not specified what bounty the parish officers shall be permitted to give, whether one pound or ten. This was left at the discretion of government, and therefore mi, misters may, if they please to render this tax productive, levy the penalties of 201. or 401, according to their pleasure. But it is impossible these penalties can ever be levied, for all the parishes in England are the delinquents. This defect in the bill I have just alluded to, was, I recollect, corrected in the bill for Ireland, for in that the bounty was limited to two thirds of the amount of the bounty settled for the regular army. Now, it is clear and manifest the house were told that it was a bill to raise men, yet it is calculated to raise a considerable sum of money. It is ridiculous to say that when you have levied the 20l. the bill will go to raise men. What do we know, or what do we care, whether it was to raise men or not, after the fines have been levied. The application of the money has nothing to do with the principle of the tax. You may apply the money to raise men, if you chuse, but that will not reconcile us to the tax, which is clearly a tax on the landed property of the country, and a most atrocious act of injustice.&#x2014;Sir, I have already observed, that in the opinion of some persons it seems as if there were something of a very peculiar nature in the present administration that gave them a title to an unbounded confidence from this house, and from the country, that no act of theirs should be marked with reprehension, and that we ought not to feel the same suspicions at the failure of their plans, as we ought to have done respecting the conduct and measures of the late silly, imbecile, insignificant ministers. Now, in what consists all this boasted improvement, and where are the merits of this great change? A change has been made, it is true. Many gentlemen expressed their desire, at this crisis of the affairs of the nation, to see an administration founded on a broad and comprehensive basis, combining all the great talents, genius, and experience, of the great public characters of this country. It was not only the wish of parliament, but it was, I believe, the wish, hope, and expectation of almost very man in the kingdom. I give to my right hon. friend opposite (Mr. Canning) full credit for his sincerity in the wishes he expressed for the promotion of this great
<col>738</col>
object. But if I do not give an equal degree of credit to the motives and conduct of others, it may be because I have not had the same opportunity of knowing how to estimate and approve their characters, habits, and principles. I believe he acted with sincerity, and felt his disappointment with regret. I suppose the right hon. gent. the present chancellor of the exchequer, found the administration too strong. That it was something like spirits above proof, which it was necessary to dilute, or like gold that was too pure for use; or, perhaps, he thought it too dazzling and brilliant, and that it was necessary to get back some of the mists and fogs of the last administration, in order to keep men's eyes from being dazzled with its prodigious glare. But does the right hon. gent. deceive himself by supposing that he came back to his office under the same, terms he quitted it? He went out, because there was a great question relative to Ireland, which he thought necessary to the salvation of that country. He went out because he could not carry that measure. He thought himself justified in saying, that there was but one person in the country who stood in the way of his wishes upon the subject. He advised the people of Ireland, after his retirement, not to form other views. He told them that they were to hail his return as the beacon which was to guide them to the object of their hopes. Is it not known that, he came back to his place without the slightest intention of performing his promise? Is it not known that he is allied in power with those who are pledged to resist the measure of Catholic emancipation? He came back with the character of having broken his faith with that laborious and respectable body of persons?&#x2014;But it is not merely with the loss of political integrity that he has come back to Office. Has he now the same character with the public which he once bad for political wisdom? What is the skill he has shewn in the first requisite of a great minister&#x2014;the knowledge of the character, talents, and dispositions of the men whom he is to appoint to fill the great situations in the civil departments, and those who are to be entrusted with the important charge of the defence of the country in the hour of danger? Whom has he now succeeded? Who gave his predecessors such high characters and such warm recommendations in this house? The noble lord (Hawkesbury) whom be panegyrized as the very
<image src="S1V0003P0I0384"/>
<col>739</col>
fittest person in the kingdom to direct the important department of Foreign Affairs, with the exception only of my honourable friend on my right hand (Mr. Fox), he has cashiered, and turned down to the home department. Why, if he understood his character and talents when he recommended him, does he degrade him now? The right hon. gent. seems to know no rule but his own will, and does not scruple to avow his. reduction of all the other members of the cabinet, to the situation of mere cyphers. Is it nothing that he should be so slow to discover the total inadequacy of the men he praises, for all the great purposes of the national defence, and the business of diplomacy? Is it nothing that he should be thus convicted of an utter incapacity to judge of the qualifications of such men? Your predecessor, sir, (lord Sidmouth) was, according to his account of him, the fittest person for the management of finance; and lord Hawkesbury and he had taken sweet counsel together, and he knew his abilities well. The right hon. gent. I assert, is convicted of an utter incapacity to form a proper judgment of public men. He cannot sit in a cabinet where they are to count noses, to use his own phrase: he must be sole master, and all the rest his mere slaves, or the tools of his power. In his former cabinet, there were men who had noses, and who were counted sometimes too. But, now, like the man mentioned in Tristram Shandy, there was only one nose as large as the steeple of Strasburg, which put all the rest out of countenance. It was the right hon. gent's early declaration, that he would never accept of any subordinate situation. Now, he will have no equality, he will have no man near him who shall have a voice of his own. Now that he comes back with a diminished character, he enlarges his claims beyond even all his former pretensions. The other, members of the cabinet are much the same as in the former "silly, imbecile" administration. There is my old friend, for whom I have a great respect, my lord Westmoreland, who is certainly neither wiser nor less wise than he was before. There is my lord Chatham, in whom there is no evident difference. The noble lord opposite (Castlereagh) came into the last administration an odd way, and continues in rather an odd way in the present. As for the lord Chancellor, the right hon. gent. does not appear to have found him out as yet. He has not yet disco-
<col>740</col>
vered that his lordship knows nothing about the laws of the country, though he was a member of the late administration. But my lord Hawkesbury is a rare example. When he was thought at one time the fittest man in the world but one to fill his department, why has the right hon. gent. forgotten to say any thing in favour of his successors, lord Harrowby and lord Mulgrave? For my lord Mulgrave, I have much personal respect; but what does the right hon. gent. say of his superiority over lord Hawkesbury, the fittest mail, save one, in the country? the noble lord, to be sure, has had experience in public affairs; he somehow or other got into Toulon; partly by some treachery among the inhabitants, who hesitated and differed about the mode of giving up the place; and perhaps it may be said he has managed very dextrously in getting into the place where he now is. Whether his lordship has the same opinion of it as he had of the other, and thinks himself, "in a state of comfortable security," I do not pretend to know. But this I may say, without trespassing on the partiality of friendship, that as the right hon. gent. has not yet given the noble lord a high character in this house, as he never yet told us that he was the fittest person in the kingdom for his office, there seems to be something like a good chance of finding that he really is so. A noble duke without an office still remains. Formerly we used to have persons in the cabinet for business; now, it would appear, we had them for ornament. They may add something to the state of the business, like the pomp of led horses in an equipage. This noble duke (of Portland) appears ready to fill a place in any cabinet. No minister can be distressed for a person to fill up a vacancy in his cabinet, while this obliging personage is to be found, The right hon. gent. seems to follow the same principle in his cabinets as in his defence bill; but he succeeds in one, though he fails in the other. He can make no use of his reservoir for soldiers, but be has a perfect reservoir for ministers; he has only to turn the cock, and in they come.&#x2014;So far as I have gone, at least the comparison will not be denied to be rather in favour of the feeble administration of the right hon. gent.'s predecessor. But then, I am told, "there's the first lord of the admiralty. Do you forget the leader of the grand catamaran expedition? Are you not aware of the important change in that department, and
<image src="S1V0003P0I0385"/>
<col>741</col>
the vast advantage the country is likely to derive from that change?" Indeed, sir, it puzzles one to imagine, how the noble viscount (Melville) came to fill that office. There seemed tee be nothing in his particular habits that pointed it out to him, Am I asked whether I would have had that minister placed in his old situation? I say no! for Heaven's sake don't let him return to us as our War minister. When I recollect his management of expeditions; when I remember Toulon, and Corsica, and Ferrol, and, moreover, the expedition to Egypt, that expedition in which Providence so singularly blessed our arms an expedition, the scheme and means of which naturally led to any thing but the actual issue, I can never wish to see the noble viscount at the head of the war department again. I grant that it is fair to say, that a minister who has conducted land operations may possibly be equally capable of managing our naval concerns; but I cannot see the force, of that sort of logic which goes to prove, that because a man is totally ignorant of land operations, he is therefore skilled in those of the sea. This reminds me of an anecdote, which I shall relate with the greater satisfaction, because it will afford me an opportunity of introducing the name of a man, whose memory is dear to many of the members of this house; I mean the late Mr. Garrick. He had a friend, a Scotch gentleman, of the name of M'Crea. He was a very clever, agreeable man, but rather an eccentric character. He was so well beloved by all who knew him, that he was called "honest Johnny M'Crea." This gentleman one day brought Garrick a tragedy in four acts. Garrick looked at it, and advised him to lay it aside, as be did hot appear to have a talent for writing tragedy. M'Crea took his advice, but the next year he went to him with a comedy in live acts, and desired it might be put in rehearsal. Garrick read it, and found it was execrable stud'; he returned it; upon which M'Crea asked him, how he could return it, as it had been written by his desire&#x2014;"My desire," replied Garrick, "I merely gave you my advice on the subject."&#x2014;"What," said Johnny, "did na ye tel me that my genius did nalee in the way o' tragedy?"&#x2014;"Yes," replied Garrick, "but I did not, therefore, say that it lay in comedy."&#x2014;"Bless my saul mon," cried Johnny, "if my talent does na lee in the way o' tragedy, and it does na lee in the way o' comedy, whare the de'el else con it lee?" Now, sir, it
<col>742</col>
does seem to me as if the noble viscount had been reasoning after the manner of honest Johnny M'Crea, and, because he has found out that his genius is not exactly fitted for laud operations, he takes it for granted that it must shine out in sea affairs, or "whare the de'el else con it lee?"&#x2014;In stating my objections to this bill, and enforcing the propriety repeal, I shall hear it said, to some others, have you got for it? But this answer would be very ill applied; for, as a bill for raising men, I say, that by getting rid of it, you can possibly lose nothing at all; as to a substitute for it, as a tax bill, I say, take any thing. I have already avowed, myself a friend ^to the old constitutional force of the militia; and I say now, that the high bounties of the militia do not arise out of that system itself. They arise out of the violation of faith with the militia. The principle of the militia originally was to engage country gentlemen to become officers, and to give little inconvenience to them in fact, to keep them in their own counties as much as possible. Something may have been gained by moving them about, in their discipline and precision, but there have been some disadvantages attending it. It is, sir, with great pride and satisfaction that I see in this country, noblemen and gentlemen leaving the hospitalities and splendour of their mansions to go out and discipline regiments of their countrymen in their service. But when I see faith broken with them, what am I to expect? You put them into a situation in which they cannot refuse to act contrary to their own wishes and intentions. Faith must be whole and unbroken, or it is nothing; a breach of it in the slightest degree, is like a flaw in an indictment, and destroys the whole. Faith is a mirror, in which the slightest fracture destroys tb.6 perfection, and you may as well shatter it at once to pieces. When militiamen are intoxicated, and means are used to tempt them, and they snap their fingers in their officers' faces, what an effect must it have; and how can you ever expect low bounties again? How differently used to be the inducement to the service! But now men are almost certain of being tempted or entrapped into service for Holland, or Egypt, or some other foreign destination, you create the cause of these high bouutks.&#x2014;One word on the subject of recruiting for rank. I confess I have not such strong
<image src="S1V0003P0I0386"/>
<col>743</col>
objections to this practice as some gentlemen entertain. When the country is pressed for men you may surely avail yourselves of this mode, especially in certain circumstances, such as formerly among the clans in Scotland, and even in some parts of Ireland. You may get men in this way more speedily than in any other in. some places, I cannot think that the body of the army can suffer much, by a few men of title and rank coming into it, and getting up rather hastily. It is better for the country that men pf property, rank, and title, should be in the army, and it is much less likely to excite any jealousy. I must trespass a short time longer on the subject of recruiting for a limited time. When the universal opinion of the thinking part of the public, and of military men, is expressed in its favour, when we can do it as soon as we can say it, when there can be. no doubt that his majesty would listen to it, when we find that the minister's own plan has totally failed, why should we not attempt it? I will not dwell further on the many reasons for it that have been so ably argued before. But I dislike much the. taking of poor ignorant boys, and fixing them in the army for their whole lives. A great lawyer has considered even the necessary mutiny act as an anomaly in the law and constitution of the country. Why should such anomalies be extended? Why should you, in this, manner cut off a large portion of your inhabitants from all the benefits of the admirable constitution of your country? Neither motives of humanity nor of patriotism have sanctioned this mode of enlisting for life, and it confessedly stands in the way of raising recruits. What can they know about their country, boys taken from under the roofs of their parents or masters, shut out of the pale of the constitution? How can they know any thing about it, till wounds, or decrepitude, or old age, drive them lo it? Why should we take children abroad and shut them out for ever, with all the consequences before you, of the ill effects it must necessarily have upon the popular feeling towards the military service? How can their minds be raised to a just estimate and admiration and love of the glorious constitution of this great country, to a sense of that equality of rights which knows no distinction between the meanest, arid the greatest and highest of their fellow subjects? How can they feel with the manly and heroic ardour with which they should
<col>744</col>
feel, when they have to fight for a country and a constitution, whose benefits and blessings are greater than those of Any other that has existed on the face of the globe? How delightful must it hot be to them to know, that at the expiration of their time they may return to the bosom of that country, to their friends, and relatives, and connections of every kind, and enjoy that happiness, for which they have fought and exposed themselves to danger and death in the field of battle, in distant climes, and on adverse shores! Let them return! Let them come back again, and repose in the glorious shade of that parental tree, under whose, branches they were reared Let them see its perfections, let them smell the fragrance of its blossoms, and taste the sweets of its fruits.&#x2014;Before I conclude, I wish to make a serious appeal to a description of members in this house, who are peculiarly interested in the repeal of this wretched bill; I mean the country gentlemen, who should consider the measure, in the present instance, as proceeding <i>de novo.</i> I ask them, will they give their sanctions to this additional tax on the landed property of Great Britain, after it has been proved to be a measure that can never be attended with any of the good effects that were promised by it, and has been shewn to be fraught with the most atrocious injustice? Next to them, I must call upon those who were the supporters, and many of them members of the late administration; I call upon the colleagues of the deposed minister, and his friends, amongst whom I am entitled to class a number of the country gentlemen, to preserve their consistency, and to be mindful of the arguments they themselves used last year, in opposition to the act of which I am now moving the repeal. I, in common with them, gave that minister my feeble support as far as it went. I did so in an independent, and, I trust, an honourable manner, without detaching myself in the least from my hon. friend hear me (Mr. Fox), nor from any of those other honourable friends, with whom I am proud to have uniformly acted, and whose principles I shall never abandon. I supported that noble lord (Sidmouth) because I considered him to have acted generally with a view to what he considered to be the good of the country, with an honest disposition, and with, a proper respect for the sound principles of the constitution; but most of all did I support him because I
<image src="S1V0003P0I0387"/>
<col>745</col>
considered him as a bar to the return of the right hon. gent. opposite roe to power. I now appeal to air those who acted then merely upon similar views with myself, to concur with me now in voting for the repeal of a measure which has already totally failed, and which they themselves have previously condemned. I surely cannot expect them, after all the reprobation expressed of this execrable law, before it had a trial, now having been proved an ineffective, cruel, and oppressive measure, to turn round upon me suddenly, and, without assigning any new reason, say, 'This is a good, a just, and a very humane law!' I implore them not to act in such a manner as to make us ashamed of having opposed the measure on its first proposal. It would not be regular in me to allude to any thing which may have passed in debate in another place, where I am told a noble lord (Sidmouth) did not speak, of this measure in such a manner as I might have expected from him; but, perhaps, noble lords, when transferred to the other house, may not think themselves so much pledged to what has passed here, as we do who remain. Let all these descriptions of gentlemen to whom I have alluded, put their hands to their hearts; and say, as men of honour, whether, if the late reconciliation had not taken place between the noble lord alluded to, and the right hon. gent. opposite me, they would not vote with me on the present question? If so, how can they reconcile any opposition to my motion, with the opinions they before so loudly proclaimed, and which, after the trial, has justified the condemnation they before pronounced upon it? It is evident this bill is a bill of excessive taxation. If the war is to be vigorously prosecuted till we can obtain a safe, and an honourable peace, additional burdens must be laid upon the people; and if so, never was there a moment when it behoved us to be more cautious how we lay them on, so that the people may not only bear them with cheerfulness, but pay them with willingness. I remember the day when the character of the independent country gentlemen, for whom certainly no man can have more respect than I have, stood much higher in this house and in the country, than it does at present. I hope they will this night recollect, that their rank and reputation never were diminished, till they were sunk during the seventeen years of the former
<col>746</col>
administration of the author of this measure, whose corrupt and unprincipled system of bestowing titles to the number of more than one moiety of the other branch, of the legislature, at the same time lowered the ancient dignity of the peerage, and impaired and undermined the independence of the house of commons, and the confidence reposed in it by the people of the country. I know that it is sometimes represented as invidious to deal in distinctions between one description of members and another; but, it would be unmanly in me, feeling as I do, to abstain from them, when, by detaching from this house, those to whom the mass of the people look with most veneration and confidence, there is a gradual introduction into the constitution of the anomaly of a popular assembly, uncontrolable by the sentiments of the people. I therefore once more coujure the country gentlemen to keep themselves, on this occasion, aloof from all party prejudices. Let us endeavour to regain the conifidence of the people, without which we can bring nothing to a successful issue in this great and perilous contest. If we so act, and the question of our safety is at issue, then I think we shall stand on impregnable ground; we shall have at command all the willing energies of the country, and that confidence which will enable us to meet any danger to which we can be exposed, without panic or dismay. It is by securing to ourselves this confidence, that we can best secure the co-operation and assistance of those powers on the continent who may be disposed to make a common cause with us; by convincing them that, instead of having no more than treaties with the ministers and with government to depend upon, they are making an alliance with the hearts and hands of the people of this country; and, most of all, it is by this reliance on the hearts of our brave country men, that we may bid a stern defiance to all the furious threats and efforts of the daring malice and perturbed ambition of the most powerful, most inveterate, and most oppressive and tyrannical enemy that ever vowed the overthrow of an ancient and splendid monarchy, and the destruction of a great, a generous, a brave, a free, and a happy people. I now move, sir, "that leave be given to bring in a bill to repeal the Additional Force Act of last year."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01531"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> rose, and spoke as follows: It is not my intention, sir, to follow the hon. gent. through all
<image src="S1V0003P0I0388"/>
<col>747</col>
those various digressions, through all those multifarious observations, which in the course of his speech he has thought proper to introduce. The greater part of these had no sort of connection with the question more immediately before the house, and were evidently introduced for the purpose of giving the hon. gent. an opportunity of shewing the house how much he was capable of contributing' to the entertainment of the house by illustration, which had no possible relation to the subject proposed for our present consideration. But, though I view those parts of the hon. gent's speech as unworthy of any detailed reply, and shall not on that account trespass long on your attention, there are one or two of the preambles to his speech which I feel it necessary shortly to advert to before I enter on the consideration of the motion with which the hon. gent. concluded his speech. The hon. gent. thought proper to advert, in the first place, to that surprise which the notice of his motion when it was first announced had created on this side of the house. The hon. gent. perhaps, found it convenient to suppose that such surprise existed, merely with the view of turning it to the advantage of his own argument. I, for my part, know nothing of that surprise to which the hon. member has alluded, but I know that the hon. member's notice was not, in the first instance, given within the doors of this house. When it was first given, I have, reason to believe, that the only emotions which it excited, were those of satisfaction; and when it was renewed in this house, I can testify, that it excited a cry of exultation. There was every reason to think that when the right hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Windham) brought forward his motion, his friends were not by any means pleased at the manner in which the discussion was closed. It was with reluctance they divided on the occasion, because they were not afforded an opportunity of delivering their several opinions. They could not help voting when the question was so loudly called for, and though the hon. member who this evening opened the debate has paid high compliments to the right hon. gentleman's eloquence, there can be no sort of doubt that he was not satisfied without an opportunity of displaying his own powers on so fertile a subject. The hon. gent. indeed, sufficiently shewed, from his conduct on the former debate, that he was not satisfied with the manner in which the debate
<col>748</col>
was terminated. It was not for nothing that the hon. member had taken so many pages of notes, not, perhaps, with the view of answering the right hon. gent's. speech, but certainly for the purpose of explaining his own peculiar views of subjects touched on in that speech, had not some discreet mediator dissuaded him from the resolution which he had previously formed. It cannot be imagined that these notes were taken for the purpose of answering the arguments of my right hon. friend (Mr. Canning), for ten days of preparation have elapsed before the hon. gent. has thought himself in a situation to attempt this with any thing like plausibility or success. In following this course, the hon. gent. was no doubt encouraged by many of his friends, who were not satisfied with the right hon. gent's view of the business, who flattened themselves that the hon. gent. would take up much more popular ground, and who looked forward to the prospect of triumphing under his banners. Whether these anticipations will be realized will best appear, sir, after we have fairly entered on the discussion of the subject. Respecting the surprise to which the hon. gent. referred, I shall only add, that on this side of the house no feeling was entertained when the resolution of bringing forward the present motion was announced, but one, namely, that we were ready to enter on the discussion at whatever period it might best suit either that or any other hon. gent. to introduce it. Now, sir, as to the second of the hon. gent.'s preambles, which was evidently intended to conciliate the right hon. gent. I feel it necessary to make a few observations. The hon. gent, begins by assuring his right hon. friend that he has no wish, whatever, to stale opinions contrary, to those which he had laid down in his speech, and thus attempts to lull asleep all apprehension of a wish to interfere with his favourite doctrine. But hardly is this opiate given, hardly are the compliments to the right hon. gent.'s talents and eloquence uttered, before the hon. 'gent. enters on a series of observations, all of which are calculated to awaken the jealousy of his right hon. friend, and to destroy even the fundamental principles of that military system in which he took so warm an interest. If he had carefully selected topics for a difference of opinion, it is not easy to see how any could have been laid hold of to mark out a more complete contrariety of opinion. The hon. gent. has this day
<image src="S1V0003P0I0389"/>
<col>749</col>
expressed himself in terms of the highest approbation of the variety of our military force. Now, the right hon. gent. founded his whole military system on its uniformity, and maintains that the divisions of volunteers, of militia, and of regulars, constitute at once its disgrace and its inefficiency. The right hon. gent. wishes the volunteer establishment to be discarded, while the hon. gent. glories in being its advocate and champion. Here, then, on the one hand, the house are called on to look to the volunteer establishment as discarded and exploded, while on the other it is not only defended, but extolled as the grand source of the security of the empire. This surely is a pretty glaring evidence of a difference of opinion, and I leave the house to form their own reflections on the subject. But, while it is impossible not to advert to this difference between the two hon. members, I cannot help observing, that the hon. gent. need not have recourse to all that delicacy which he has used on the present occasion. It so happens, that on every one of the leading points, on which the right hon. gent.'s speech on a former occasion was founded, the right hon. gent.'s opinions had undergone a most important revolution. He now differs as much from himself as it is possible for the hon. gent, to do on any of the matters which he has this evening touched on in his speech. The augmentation of the militia, the plan of raising provisional cavalry, the measure of obtaining men for rank, as well as the call on the parishes for their quotas, all of which measures the right hon. gent. now so strongly censures, were measures adopted when he himself was along with me a member of the cabinet, and at the same time was actually Secretary at War. I shall not now, sir, attempt to go very much into the question, how far the opinion of the country is to be guided by the opinion expressed by an individual of acknowledged abilities and consideration. But this I feel myself entitled at least to say, that if any man not only assents to, but actually brings forward measures as a member of the cabinet, and thinks proper, after an interval of a few years, severely to censure the same measures when he is out of power, the confidence of the country, in his opinion, must be materially diminished. Now, sir; in the year 1796, the right hon. gent. not only assented to all the measures I have just al-
<col>750</col>
luded to, as a member of the cabinet, but joined' me cordially in bringing them forward, and was willing to take his full share of all the responsibility attached to them, either in this house or in the country. He was then as much as he possibly could be, their parliamentary author, and now he feels himself called on to condemn them in terms of the utmost severity. Thus much, sir, I have thought it my duty to say as to the hon. gent.'s preambles. Of his numerous digressions I shall have occasion to say a few words before I sit down, but shall, in the mean time, proceed to the real question before the house.&#x2014;Before I go further, I beg leave to disclaim at the outset, the view of the question really before the house, as the hon. gent. has thought proper to state it. The question is not, whether the bill has, in all its extent, fulfilled the object for which it was originally designed, but whether it has answered its end to a certain extent, and whether, from the experience of its past effects, it would be better to give it a further trial, or at once to accede to the hon. gent.'s motion for its repeal. I fully allow, when I speak of the utility of the measure I speak of its utility for encreasing the numbers of our regular army. The hon. gent. on the other hand, affects to view it merely as a tax, and solely as a bill for raising money. As a bill for raising men, the hon. gent. asserts that it has produced no effect, and cannot produce any effect, and it must, therefore, be solely with a view of raising money that it is continued. Now, sir, to this assertion, my answer is simple, unequivocal, and direct. I always disclaimed the idea of the bill being considered as a bill for raising money, and never attempted to defend it but as an instrument for recruiting with the greatest expedition our regular army. The hon. gent, has thrown out a hint about withdrawing the bounties from the parishes, and in that way rendering it a money bill. This, sir, is really a sort of proceeding so disgraceful and abominable; a sort of proceeding so utterly out of the contemplation of his majesty's ministers, that I am astonished it has ever been alluded to. I ask support to the bill solely on the ground of its being a measure for the augmentation of our military force, and as it appears calculated to promote this important end. The moment it ceases to produce any effect, or to hold out any prospect of accomplishing
<image src="S1V0003P0I0390"/>
<col>751</col>
this end, then I shall certainly feel myself bound not merely not to oppose, but actually to move for its repeal. In one sense, indeed, the bill operates in a pecuniary way by the penalties, which it inflicts, on those parishes by which their quotas are not provided. But even in this view of it, it is far from being attended with peculiar severity. On the contrary, it suspends the penalties of the army of reserve act, and substitutes in their room others of a milder form. It is, indeed, impossible to conceive any thing milder than the act is, in its present application, unless, as is not pretended to be either just or expedient, the penalties were to be wholly removed. The hon. gent, in speaking of the effect of the bill, seems entirely to have lost sight of one circumstance Very important to be considered, which is the period when the bill first came into activity. From whatever causes this arose, I shall not now stop to determine, but certain it is, that at was not till the 14th of Nov. that orders were first given for general recruiting to supply parishes where deficiencies existed. It is, therefore, sir, to the operation of the bill since that period, much more than to the effect it has produced in the preceding months, that we ought fairly to apply for an. opinion of its merits. Looking then at the last three months, I find that on an average of each week, there have been nearly two hundred recruits obtained. Thus, taking three months as an average, the result will he, that under the operation of the bill, it will produce an annual addition of betwixt nine or ten thousand men. I ask then, sir, with such a statement as this before us, if we can think of listening to a proposition for repealing the bill just at the moment when it shall come into full activity? The hon. gent. has thought proper to say that not one man has been raised by the, bill, and the right hon. gent, maintained that its effects had been altogether inconsiderable. But, sir, I will ask these gentlemen and the house, whether tie effect which I have hinted at, be not one of very considerable magnitude? Whether it be not in fact, nearly equal to the whole of the recruits obtained by the ordinary means of recruiting? On this simple ground, I might almost exclusively rest the merits of the bill, and ask the house whether it is one which aught to be rashly and inconsiderately discarded? But I feel it my duty to take a fuller view of
<col>752</col>
the subject. Here it appears, as far as experience has proceeded, and as far as we can possibly judge from that experience, that we may reasonably expect an addition every year of no less than nine or ten thousand men to our regular forces. And are we then to be told that the measure has proved altogether inefficient? It is true, from the experience of the three months I have referred to, I cannot pretend to form a conclusive opinion, but certainly I have a much better right than the gentlemen on the other side to offer an opinion on the future effects of the bill. As far as experience extends, these three months are a pretty good proof that the bill has answered its end, and a tolerably fair presumption that it will continue to answer its end still more successfully in future. It is true, that the same favourable result may not continue to be experienced, but with stronger probability I may say, that results still more favourable may be experienced. Let gentlemen consider under what circumstances the bill has hitherto operated, and they will see that this is no unreasonable anticipation. Let them reflect what has been the drain of men on the country for the last eighteen months: first, the militia were balloted for, immediately after the supplementary militia were raised, and then came the army of reserve; so that in G. Britain alone above 100,000 men had been raised in the short space of a year and a half. If then, under all the unfavourable operation of these circumstances, the bill has produced the effects which I have described, what may not be expected from it when these circumstances are removed? One great evil which the bill was intended to destroy, was the removal of those excessive bounties which the army of reserve had created. While the recollection of these high bounties existed, it is not to be imagined that moderate bounties could have had a fair chance of success. When, however, the memory of them is in a certain degree obliterated, which it must of necessity be, I entertain no sort of doubt that the bill will be found fully adequate to all the purposes for which it was framed. We are therefore hitherto not entitled to calculate its effects in all their extent. I have stated what probability justifies, and what actual experience has proved; and therefore I have completely succeeded in proving that the reasons adduced by the hon. gent, in support of the repeal, ought not for a moment to
<image src="S1V0003P0I0391"/>
<col>753</col>
be entertained by the house. The hon. gent, has attempted to argue that the measure is not at all calculated to produce the end it professes to have in view; but in what manner he has supported his arguments I leave it to the house to judge. The hon. gent, seems totally to forget that hitherto the bill has operated only on a partial and limited scale. It has been applied only to the deficiencies in the militia or the army of reserve. Its effects have not been felt over the great bulk of the kingdom. Where it has hitherto been tried, it has had to encounter very formidable obstacles. It has been applied chiefly in those districts where men could with the greatest difficulty be found, and therefore it is the less to be wondered at, if it has not answered in all their extent the wishes or expectations of those who originally supported it. Even under all the hazard of the penalties for the army of reserve and the militia, the men could not be procured in the places to which I have been referred; and I will put it to the candour of gentlemen, whether, if the bill had been even less successful than it has been, it would have been at all a matter of astonishment? To all these circumstances let me add, sir, the industry with which the statements of the total failure of the bill have been circulated over the country, the circumstance of its having last session encountered violent opposition, and being carried by a small majority, accompanied by the expectation that, it would certainly be repealed on the meeting of parliament. When, however, these prejudices are dissipated, when the country see that parliament are determined to give the measure a fair trial, when they have every reason to think that it is meant to be a permanent part of our military system, I have no hesitation in expressing my conviction that it will fulfil the most sanguine expectations of its most zealous supporters. If any thing further were wanting to prove that the bill has not yet got this fair trial, it would be the consideration that in no case yet have the penalties of the bill been imposed. It becomes, however, a matter of consequence to have it understood that they certainly will be imposed; and I venture to predict, that even the knowledge will go a considerable way to giving the bill all the effect which I hope it will be found ultimately to produce. At present I have no doubt that in several districts sufficient exertion has not been em-
<col>754</col>
ployed to procure the required quota, from an expectation that the penalties would not be enforced. When, however, they are fully apprized of the contrary, they will feel it necessary to make new efforts, and if these efforts are properly directed, there can be no question about procuring the necessary quotas. The measure then, sir, has not been hitherto fairly tried, and I certainly shall not part from it, unless reasons much stronger than those which the hon. gent, has condescended to use shall be employed, and unless the events of the remainder of the year prove that my expectations of its future effects turn out to be unfounded. But, sir, I am accused of disappointing the house and the country, by holding out, through the medium of this bill, the prospect of a most rapid and extensive increase of our regular force. Now, as to this statement, I have to offer a few observations, and, sir, I beg leave to say, that I never held out any such expectations, I never did give any such pledge, I never said that I looked to this measure solely as the means of recruiting our regular army. I never argued that this measure was exclusively to furnish us with a disposable force. Let me remind the house, sir, shortly, of the circumstances under which the measure was produced. The hon. gent, in his observations, seemed to insinuate that I was hostile to the general principle of the army of Reserve Act. Now, this is a most gross misrepresentation of my views on this subject. So far from disapproving of that measure, I approved of it cordially, and, I am in the judgment of the house, that I supported it in the most strenuous manner. That act certainly did produce a large accession to the army, and, on that account, was a most important measure. But it was attended with many very serious inconveniences, in raising the bounties, in discouraging direct in listing into the regular army, and in promoting desertion. Those who felt all these inconveniencies, and who were at the same time convinced that the penalties were excessive, thought that some milder act should be substituted in its place, that the exertions of gentlemen, parochial officers, and local zeal, would produce effects as important as local activity. These were the grounds on which. I originally presented the measure, and on the same ground I continue of opinion that it is in the train of accomplishing all that was expected from it. But, I never did give the house reason to think that I
<image src="S1V0003P0I0392"/>
<col>755</col>
expected any rapid or immediate augmentation of our regular force from its operation. I did state that the bill would give us a strong chance for encreasing our regular army in addition to those which previously existed. I did state that the bill would not have the effect of interfering with any of our existing modes of recruiting the regular army, or of preventing the adoption of any other suggestions which gentlemen might feel it their duty to bring forward on this most important subject. But on the subject of a great additional force alluded to by the hon. gent. I must beg leave also to make a single observation. I thought I had on a former occasion sufficiently expressed my opinion as to what appeared to me the quantum of force which I thought necessary to our national security. I did on a former occasion distinctly declare my conviction that we had already in point of quantum of force nearly as great a number as the circumstances of the empire required, and I added, that what we then wanted was a disposable force. How far we have or have not got this disposable force will presently come to be a matter of consideration. But, sir, to shew the house clearly that no very great addition to the military force of the country was meant suddenly to be obtained by the bill, let me only call on gentlemen to look to the bill itself; they will there find that in the first instance only 9000 men were to be raised for G. Britain. How different is this from the representation given by the hon. gent, in the course of his speech. From the observations of the hon. gent. I am strongly inclined to think that he has not given himself the trouble of consulting more than the outside of the bill, for if he had at all considered it with the least care, he never could have supposed that I meant the bill: in the course of one year to raise the enormous number of 85,000 men. In the first instance, there was only a deficiency of 9000 men to be made up, and the bill was to operate in producing a permanent force; in a gradual way, and could not be expected to produce its full effect in less than three, four, or even six or seven years. I have attempted to shew the house on the simplest principles, that the bill may be fairly expected to produce an annual addition of 9 or 10,000 men to our regular force, and that this effect has already been produced under a complication of the most unfavourable circumstances. I confess, seeing what the bill has already done, and
<col>756</col>
looking to what it is capable of effecting, I anticipate from it the most important and happy results. I am really, sir, astonished at the language of the hon. gent, and those who join him in support of the repeal. I confess it has never been my fortune within the walls of this house, to hear any proposition so arrogantly and so vehemently brought forward, which had so little even of the appearance of argument to uphold it. The principal object of the bill was in the first instance to do away an evil which had become the subject of general complaint. Has it not produced this effect? Has it not relieved the counties from excessive burdens? Has it not lowered the excessive bounties which had brought regular recruiting almost to a stand? And has it not in this way become a most important auxiliary to the augmentation of our disposable force? Will it be attempted to be denied, that the recruiting is now going on with fresh spirit, since the evil of excessive bounties has been removed? The hon. gent, has drawn a very strange picture of the state of our regular army, and has even endeavoured gravely to maintain, that since last year it has received no sort of addition or extension. I am really, sir, at a loss to know where the hon. gent, has been able to collect his information, for sure I am, it is not to be obtained from the papers on the table. But the hon. gent, seems so wholly intent on the repeal of this obnoxious bill, that he will not suffer his mind seriously to consider the subject in all its relations. Surely it is but fair that the hon. gent, who seemed so much disposed to look back to the period when the bill was not in a state of operation, should look to the time when it shall be in full activity. This, however, the hon. gent, seems to have no disposition to do, but satisfied that the measure is bad, he will not give himself time to see whether or not it actually does aid the regular recruiting. Now, sir, as to the state of our disposable force now, compared to what it was the preceding year, a very short statement will afford the house the clearest view. Here the right hon. gent, entered in to a statement to shew, that we had this year in disposable infantry, cavalry, and artillery, in addition to what we had last year, about 20,000 men. Having finished this, he proceeded: Surely, sir, this is no discouraging prospect, this is no illustration of the assertions of the hon. gent, that the state of the army is neglected; this is no argument to prove
<image src="S1V0003P0I0393"/>
<col>757</col>
that the bill is that obnoxious, inefficient measure which the hon. gent, and his friends are so eager to represent it. The statement I have made is not indeed a direct argument in favour of the bill; but it is at least a strong proof that the bill is not calculated to injure the regular recruiting, but on the contrary, to assist it in the most advantageous manner. It assists it by removing existing impediments, by destroying enormous bounties by putting a stop to the operation of the ballot, out, of which high bounties necessarily sprung. I wish gentlemen seriously to consider in what state the recruiting now is, before they are so clamorous for the repeal of the bill. Why, sir, I find in the month of Feb. alone, no less than 1495 recruits have been obtained. But it is not to that, month alone that I wish them to confine their attention. I have already mentioned that the number of men added to our disposable force during the last year up to the 1st of Jan. is 20,000. Of these 11,882 have been added since June last, that is within a period of seven months. The whole of the addition for the preceding year has been only 12,000 for a period of 12 months. As far as experience can guide us, we have reason to think that we shall have annually 8 or 9000 added to our regular force by the operation of the bill, and according to the proportion of recruits obtained in the month of Feb. supposing the same proportion to go forward, we should have a total of 14,608. Admitting that, to these are added 8000 others who volunteered in the course of the year from limited to unlimited service, we shall have in one year an addition to our disposable force of no less than 26,000 men. When I say this, I beg to be clearly understood, as giving no pledge that such a number will actually be obtained; but I only say that, if the recruit. in should go on, as there is reason to expect it will, a number nearly equal to that may be reasonably expected. Now that the impediments to the recruiting service are principally removed, and that an impulse has been given to the service, we had every ground for hope on the subject. When we consider with what rapidity almost indeed unexampled, the new levies have been completed; what a spirit had been exhibited during the test and several preceding years; what was the large amount of the addition to our disposable force; when we reflect on all these things seriously, how, sir, can any gentleman main-
<col>758</col>
tain that our military system is quite inefficient? I am at a loss to conceive o what principles they act, and am unable to see how they can seriously stand up and hold assertions, when facts so powerfully demonstrate their fallacy.&#x2014;I shall now, sir, beg leave to make a few remarks on some of the extraneous matters which the hon. gent. has thought proper to introduce in the course of his speech; and the first of these is, the state of the naval defence of the country. I am not prepared to say, what could have induced the hon. gent, to allude to this subject, unless it was that they were suggested by what fell from my right lion, friend (Mr. Canning) on a former evening, But what my right hon. friend then said, was introduced only incidentally, and not with any view to provoke discussion. All that he advanced, was, as far as my recollection goes, that the country, in consequence of the state both of our naval and military defence, was not now in that state of danger to which it had been formerly exposed. On this slight foundation the hon. gent, thinks proper to attack the present state of the naval defence, and directly attacks some expressions of mine on a former evening, respecting the noble lord (St. Vincent), lately at the head of the naval department Now, sir, I certainly cannot think this the proper period for going into this discussion. It is quite clear, that it could not be gone into this evening with the least prospect of advantage to the noble person concerned or the public. I shall, on that account, only make a few observations. The opinion I gave on the ministerial conduct of that noble earl was given when I had not the. honour of being in his majesty's government; but the opinion I offered to the house upon the late first lord of the admiralty, as a minister, before I was in office, has been confirmed by every thing I have seen since I came into it. Whether there is to be an inquiry into that subject, I know not; but if there be, I am ready to support my opinion, I shall not be deterred from giving my opinion again, if called upon; but I do not think that subject is to be pressed into discussion by those who do not think it necessary for the public benefit to institute an inquiry into that subject. I entertain a high sense of, and gratitude for, the naval services and general character of the noble earl; and whatever I may think of him, or of his demerits under his administration of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0394"/>
<col>759</col>
the admiralty, I have no desire to bring forward any charge against him when out of office. The hon. gent, challenges me to support my charge, and triumphantly alleges I have given up the inquiry. Now I put it to this house, whether it is mean in me to resist the invitation of instituting an inquiry into that subject? Whether I have not a right to consider whether the public service would derive any benefit at this moment by such an inquiry? I have no desire to do so. It is not for me to blink the subject; but I do decline at this time to press an inquiry, because I think that no real benefit will result to the public from it. I have no desire to bring forward any thing that is personal against any person connected with the late board of admiralty, and least of all against him, whose former merits in the naval service cannot in my mind be easily cancelled by his demerits in the civil administration of its government. As to the present state of the naval defence, I shall not now enter on the subject; but content myself with saying, that when the regular inquiry is moved for, I am ready to meet it. I know that the greatest professional men in the kingdom have been consulted, and every thing has been done which they recommended. The hon. gent, talks of a few ships unfit for use, purchased by govt. but has he taken the trouble to gain accurate information on the subject? Has he endeavoured to make himself acquainted with the activity exerted by the board of admiralty to repair old ships, to lay down new, and to expedite every part of the naval department?&#x2014;The hon. gent, seldom condescends to favour us with a display of his extraordinary powers of imagination and of fancy; but when he does come forward, we are prepared for a grand performance. No subject comes amiss to him, however remote from the question before the house. All that his fancy suggests at the moment, or that he has collected from others; all that he can utter in the ebullition of the moment; all that he has slept on and matured, are combined and produced for our entertainment. All his hoarded repartees, all his matured jests, the full contents of his common place book, all his severe invectives, all his bold hardy assertions he collects into one mass, which he kindles into a blaze of eloquence, and out it comes altogether, whether it has any relation to the subject in debate or not. Thus it is, with his usual felicity, that the hon. gent.
<col>760</col>
finds a new argument for the repeal of the present bill, because the house and the country has less confidence in the present than even in the late ministers. On this point, too, I shall say but a few words. If the hon. gent really thinks ministers unworthy of the confidence of parliament, he has means of founding a motion for some proceedings on this subject; but let me conjure the house, whatever they may think of me, not to wound the public service by repealing this bill merely by doing so to injure the minister. Whether I possess the confidence of the parliament or the country or not, certainly this is not the mode of determining it. But, sir, it is rather whimsical, that at the very moment the hon. gent, is saying that I do not now possess the confidence of the parliament and the country, be is paying me an involuntary compliment, by owning that at least I formerly enjoyed that confidence. It is however, rather unfortunate that there is not a single opprobrious epithet which the hon. gent, has now employed against me, which on almost every disputed point he did not lavish on me at that very period when he allows I possessed the confidence of parliament and the country, a confidence then expressed by four-fifths and nine-tenths of the country. The hon. gent, has thought proper to allude, too, to the composition of the ministry, and here I must again beg leave to wave the discussion. I desire the house and the country to look to the connections, to the constitutional agreements or differences, to the habits, to the general views of those who compose the present administration, compared with other connections of certain hon. gentlemen on the other side, and then I am ready to abide by their candid decision. The hon. gent, takes a great deal of merit to himself for the generous, magnanimous, and disinterested support which he afforded a noble friend of mine (lord Sidmouth) while at the head of affairs. I will allow that the hon. gent, did give my noble friend a few votes, most probably when they were not wanted, and my noble friend is doubtless under obligations to him for his magnanimity. I believe, however, the hon. gent, was not at all backward in giving his votes, when my noble friend was forced to resign the helm of affairs, and in this most likely he displayed his disinterested conduct. The hon. gent next passes on to another noble friend of mine, (Lord Hawkesbury) to whom
<image src="S1V0003P0I0395"/>
<col>761</col>
he applies a term which he could not have taken from any thing but the Jacobin code. That noble lord, he says, has been "cashiered." How such a term can be applied to the change of situation to which that noble lord has succeeded, I am at a loss to conceive. An arrangement did no doubt take place in his majesty's government, but that arrangement was made with the free will and entire concurrence of that noble lord, and it was never proposed with any other intention. How, then, can the noble lord be said to have been cashiered? so far from my having ever harboured any thing like sentiments of disrespect for that noble lord, I have never, even when I disagreed with him on certain measures, felt the least diminution of friendship and regard for that noble lord; and far from any abatement of attachment to him having taken place, it has since been encreased, if possible, by subsequent proofs of that character for which I so highly esteemed him. To the other insinuations of a similar tendency, which have dropped from the hon. gent, as they are wholly without any foundation, I shall make no reply: but thus much I have thought it necessary to observe, in vindication of their characters and of my own. But the hon. gent, seems to rely much on his appeal to the country gentlemen; on them he confidently calls as under a kind of obligation to vote against the bill; but by the motives from which he supposes that obligation to spring, the narrow motives of pecuniary considerations, I will never believe they can for a moment be actuated. I am not now to be taught what opinion I am to entertain of that most respectable class of the community. They are still distinguished in my opinion by the same sternness of character, by the same ardour for the honour of their country, by the same zeal for the public service for which they have always been so conspicuous, and confident I am that they will never act on the narrow and selfish principles, which the hon. gent, thinks them capable of being warped by. They are always serious and earnest in coming forward to expose their lives and fortunes in the just and necessary contest in which their country may be engaged, and when the constitution and liberty of the country are endangered. Such men can therefore never be actuated by mere pecuniary motives, or by paltry parochial considerations. While they no doubt wish to consult the com-
<col>762</col>
fort and convenience of the lower classes, their minds will also ascend to the times and circumstances in which they are or may be placed, and they undoubtedly will now feel the necessity of impressing a more military character upon the people, and they will as cheerfully concur in providing for what that necessity imposes. They will not look upon the present measure in the light of a pecuniary burden, but as a part of that system which is to contribute to that salutary end. Whenever the measure shall be found to operate as a pecuniary burden, I shall be the first to disclaim it, and to propose its repeal. But I am persuaded it will have no such effect; but on the contrary, as the number raised by it will annually increase, the expence attending it will not fall on the parishes or individuals, but will be paid out of the public fund. Such are my views and hopes of its prospective effets; and strongly impressed with these sentiments, I shall conclude, sir, with giving my decided negative to the motion made by the hon. gent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01532"><member>Mr. Windham</member><membercontribution> said, he could not help remarking, how very naturally arid willingly the fight hon. gent, had deviated from the subject before the house, and had made excursions from it to other topics with which it was by no means connected. The right hon. gent, had first endeavoured to point out diversities of opinion between him and his hon. friend who opened the debate, and then between him and himself, on former occasions. On the former of those supposed diversities of opinion, the right hon. gent, had remarked with such violence, as must have induced persons who had not heard the speech of his hon. friend who opened the business, to suppose that he had attempted to conceal that any such diversity Subsisted. Such, however, was well known to the house, and such had been particularly marked by his hon. friend this night in opening the debate. There was nothing inconsistent in his hon. friend, who thought a variety of force was not detrimental to the military service of the country, and in him who thought otherwise, agreeing, that there was nevertheless a necessity for going into a committee on the military defence of the country. It had been stated by him the other night, that the volunteers were not the force on which we ought at present to rely alone, and sin this opinion, he had reason to believe his hon. friend and he were not so much at variance as was generally imagined. That, however,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0396"/>
<col>763</col>
was a subject with which, like the former, they had nothing at present to do. They might like or might dislike the volunteer system; but whatever was their opinion on that subject, it had nothing to do with the propriety of going into a committee to see what might be done more effectually for the defence of the country, or with their concurring in the repeal of the act now under discussion, as being essential to the enactment of a measure of greater efficiency. When fundamental points on which a diversity of opinion had been entertained by gentlemen in that house did not present themselves for consideration, it would be an act rather too hard to say that they were not entitled to acquiesce in any other points connected with the subject, by which, nevertheless, in the opinion of both, the end which they had mutually in view was likely to be attained. As to his own individual diversity from himself, with which lie had been charged by the right hon. gent, he could only declare, that his opinions on grand and constitutional points had never varied, and were during the whole time of his co-operation with the right hon. gent, the same as they were at the present moment. He had adhered to his opinions&#x2014; the right hon. gent, had deserted his. The right hon. gent, need not suppose that he had forgotten what had passed during the period in which he was in office along with the right hon. gent. Whether he was a party or not a party to those measures, he would now, however, speak of them according to the impression and conviction the result of them, had left on his mind. He could not he answerable, any more than the house, for the measures which had then passed, but whether he had since changed his opinion, or they had not been agreeable to his opinion at the time, and he had felt himself Secluded by the situation which he held from putting a bar in the way of what had been resolved on by the cabinet in general, it would be subversive of all moral feeling and, principle, that when he came to see the inadequacy or mischievous tendency of any acts to the passing of which he had in any way been accessary, that be should be hound up from afterwards declaring his: change of opinion. Such, he conceived, was not to be required of any person holding situation in the management, of public affairs. But the right hon. gent, in a climax of triumph, had clinched his argument his (Mr. W. s) responsibility, by stating that he was then even secretary.
<col>764</col>
at war. He confessed he had a good share in carrying on the war business out of doors; but he declared that he had no more to do with the bills alluded to, in his capacity of secretary at war, than if he had been secretary to the board of agriculture. But what had been the conduct of the right hon. gent? Did it not go to a condemnation of every one measure of which he had been the original projector? Was not the ballot system of his introduction? Who ever hoard of such enormous bounties as had lately been common, till they necessarily followed from measures recommended by the right hon. gent, himself? The right hon. gent, had, indeed, profited a little by the suggestions of him and his friends. He wished he had carried their suggestions further; and he was satisfied if he had; wished to profit by experience, he had sufficient opportunities of doing so from the errors, of his own administration&#x2014;The principal ground, however, on which he had, from the beginning, objected to the bill was, the oppressive and dangerous tendency of the practices which it was calculated to encourage. The harshness of the measure itself could never, in his eyes, have been done away, had the bill been ever so successful. On no principle could it be contended that parish officers were to be esteemed better recruiters than any other, than on that very ground on which they were totally unfit to be recruiters at all. In their hands nothing but harsh and improper means of fulfilling their task, could be expected to be resorted to. How far men would be induced to exercise the power vested in them tyrannically, was evident from experience; and, in order to shew what little chance the poor man had of being protected in his right, he need only to refer to a recent event which formed a part of the practice now prevalent in, this metropolis. Was it not a fact, that a, number of poor Irishmen, making merry at their own houses, in that affecting kind of festivity which the day they were celebrating rendered doubly sacred, had been attacked by the meddling and vexatious, interference of magisterial authority; had been accused of the worst of crimes; had been left all night in prison; and, afterwards, some of them driven into exile&#x2014; for the worst of exile was the sea, to a man who had not been bred to it; and this, because they could, not give a satisfactory, account of themselves; or, in other words, were poor men? Was there law, he would
<image src="S1V0003P0I0397"/>
<col>765</col>
ask, in this kingdom, for such a stretch of authority? Was it to be found even in the count of exchequer chamber, with all the judges of the land assembled to give it sanction? Yet such had been the conduct of some of the inferior magistrates of this metropolis; and was he not right in his original fears expressed on the subject of this bill? and was he not now again entitled to urge, that such would be the species of law which the arming parish officers with the powers of this act would naturally produce? Was he not even justified in supposing that the parish crimps might have, persons present who might procure this sea to he changed into a military service, and, of course, that those very men who were thus illegally dragged from their own homes, served to swell the lists which had lately been laid on the table, or would make their appearance in the next return&#x2014; There was another reason, however, on which it was apparent that the bill was not deserving of support. With all its objectionable features, it had wholly failed of its object. This, however, was flatly contradicted, and an attempt was made by soothing argument to recall the dead carcase of this bill to life. Whatever might be said of its remote design, or of its immediate operation, he presumed all must agree it had been completely obstructed. Where were the 60 battalions which were to have been raised? The army of reserve was to feed the permanent force, and this was to feed the army of reserve. A copious river was to pour forth its waters, and it has been converted into a contemptible rill. The right hon. gent, with some artificial discretion, had told the house he would not expose what had been done by the bill, but he would have recourse to his rule of three, and acquaint gentlemen what it would do. It had been inefficient; but, he said, try it longer, arid it will succeed. So said the empiric&#x2014;"The spring is approaching, you will find yourself better." The quackery was renewed, and in the mean lime the patient died. Like those pharmaceutic pretenders, the right hon. gent, would never be satisfied of the deficiency of his skill until it was too late to avoid the consequences of his temerity. But this bill was an experiment. This was a philosophic age, and every thing was to be submitted to the test of experiment. The pence of Amiens, which was to restore tranquillity to Europe, oppressed and exhausted, was an experiment. Scientific
<col>766</col>
persons, by experiment, meant something which was to be tried, not the matter itself, for the sake of which the trial was made; but here all was submitted to experiment, on the large Scale, and chance and accident were exchanged for political Wisdom and security. The house ought hot to consent to be put off with experiment after experiment, merely to gratify the projector&#x2014;The right hon. gent, however, lorded It over the regular recruiting, and alleged that his mode had been equally successful, if not more so, than the old mode of recruiting for the army. That, however, was one of the main, grounds on which he had from the beginning reprobated the right hon. gent.'s measure. He had stated all along, and it was now confirmed by experience, that so far from being an innocent bill, not Only could it do no good Itself, but it had even impeded the regular recruiting by not Only continuing, but even enhancing the bounties The right hon. gent, had complained that the measure had, in some respect, been treated with ridicule. He could not help thinking that there never was a bill so much entitled to be treated with ridicule, nor one where ridicule was so much the test of truth. If gentlemen had exerted themserlves to devise arty thing which should be calculated to excite ridicule against the govt. what could they have invented more likely to produce it than the mere project of recruiting the regular army by parish officers? It was impossible to speak of It as a great and solemn political measure; but, however laughable it might be in its origin, it was most grave arid tragical in its consequences. It was a little singular that to a measure of this nature the right hon. gent, had directed his attention to so little purpose. There was a species of vulgar produce, the turnip, well known hi the county with which be was best acquainted, that was well adapted to the poor soil, which extensively prevailed there: in the rich loams Of other districts it grew rank and degenerated. Perhaps a subject so plain and familiar as that which was connected with the present question was not suited to the fertile invention and warm imagination of the right hon. gent. There was a class of writers who had devoted much of then time to the contemplation Of picturesque effect, and in the selection of a place of habitation enquired not Where the greatest accommodation could be afforded, but where the eye
<image src="S1V0003P0I0398"/>
<col>767</col>
would be most exquisitely gratified. The right hon. gent, was liable to a perversion of intellect not very dissimilar; he did not seem so much to consider what measures would most redound to the substantial advantage of the country, as what view he could present of them by his flowery speeches in the house of commons. The object of the present motion of his hon. friend was to avoid the most afflicting events. We were now thoughtlessly proceeding, squandering away the most valuable time. There was no ground for confidence, either from the merit of the measure, or from the authority and wisdom of those who adopted it. The right hon. gent, then concluded, by declaring, that he should have conceived the bill a bad measure, even if it had succeeded. It would, in his opinion, have gradually eaten up and undermined the ordinary recruiting for the army. It had, however, so completely failed, that he was convinced every gentleman who came up from the country in the beginning of this session, expected it would have been one of the first acts of the right hon. gent, himself to move for its repeal.</membercontribution></p>

He wished, therefore, that the house should not go away impressed with the statements of the right hon. gent, which were for the greater part incorrect. The house might also wish to hear the sentiments of the noble lord (Castlereagh) who formed a part of the last administration, as well as the opinion of the hon. and learned gent, opposite to him (the attorney general), on an interesting subject of this nature, and one on which they had already addressed the house. The right hon. the chancellor the exchequer had confined him-self-ajmost entirely to denying the detail submitted by his hon. friend (Mr. Sheridan) and gave up the principal of the measure;
<col>768</col>
he no longer insisted on the enthusiasm with which it would be adopted, or urged the sympathy which would exist between the recruits raised for local or county regiments; when he abandoned that ground, he gave up, of course, the substance and efficiency of the bill, according to the right hon. gent's, own ideas at its introduction. He should, therefore, from his own shewing, vote for the repeal of a bill, the ground of which he had thus relinquished. Now, as to the detail. On the 29th of June 1804, this act was passed: in 14 days county meetings were to be held, and in one month the parishes of the kingdom were to be in a general state of activity to raise 16,000 men to supply the deficiencies. This ground-work was all to be performed by the 1st of Oct. 1804. But it was found this ponderous machine could not proceed. A noble lord in the home department then applied his shoulders to the wheel: still it was immoveable: it resisted the efforts also of all the lords-lieutenant of the counties. In this distressing predicament the ministers, on their own authority, suspended the operation of the bill until the 15th of Nov. considerably after all its salutary effects were to have been enjoyed. Thus, the executive government, represented by the secretary of state, assumed to itself the power of preventing the influence of a legislative regulation. It was not, however, perfectly correct to assert that its entire operation was postponed to the 15th of Nov. and this was one of the fallacies with which the right hon. gent, had amused the house. As far as related to raising men, its agency commenced on the 5th of September: it was not the opposition within that house; it was not the resistance from exterior causes, but it was the absolute impossibility of carrying the act into execution, which occasioned this delay. The procrastination proposed on the assessment of the penalties was until the 15th November; but the truth was, that no order was given for this purpose until the 18th of the month latently expired. The right hon. gent, enquired, "are we to suppose the act will not fulfil the intentions of its authors, and that it will not, because it has not provided men?" And when its incompetency at present was pressed as a rational ground to presume its continued insufficiency, the objection is met by the declaration, that the operation of the bill was alone extended to the most exhausted parts of the king-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0399"/>
<col>769</col>
dom. Was ever argument so idle and evasive? The numbers that were to have been raised were 27,000: of these, 9,000 were to have been acquired from the counties, between the 1st of Oct. 1804, and the same period in 1805. All this time had been lost; the bill had been suspended, and the house was now to be told, that the activity would be in the precise ratio of its inactivity to the present hour. The right hon. gent, said, with respect to immediate means of defence, the kingdom was in a state of security. The foundation of this assertion deserved to be examined. He insisted that he had a right to contend, and be convinced from what had occurred hitherto, that this bill would never be of and avail, and was most unjust and oppressive to the people as well as destructive to the recruiting system. It was utterly impossible to raise, men under it but by exacting the penalty, which would prove a most vexatious and intolerable tax. In this opinion he was the more confirmed from hearing the weak defence and flimsy speech of the right hon. gent, (Mr. Canning) that night. The right hon. gent, said, however, that the country was in a stale of perfect security, and recounted the number of our force; but he could not induce himself to expect as much from the exertions of the volunteers as the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer or his hon. friend (Mr. Sheridan) seemed to do. He was a volunteer himself, and respected that body as much as any man; but too much reliance should not be placed on their supposed superior discipline at present. It was rather strange also, that their numbers had diminished so considerably from last year, when the number was returned to have been 480,000, and were at present reduced to 366,000. He only mentioned this circumstance, in order to shew the abusurdity of exulting sometimes on account of numbers, which were subject to such sudden casualties and diminution. With respect to the state of our general defence, he should not hesitate to say that we were as much exposed to the enemy at present, as at any period since the renewal of hostilities. He was one of those who cons dered the danger as great now, if not greater than heretofore; because the enemy, ever active, had not relaxed a moment from the prosecution of his plans against this country, and had time to accumulate his forces in all the points from which our coast was most assailable he collected his
<col>770</col>
forces, and carried on his preparations, even by sea, in spite of all our efforts to prevent him. The catamaran attempts made during the last summer to annoy him without effect must have convinced him that we could not discomfit his projects. If any doubt remained respecting the inutility of blockading, it must be removed at present, when it was certain that two of his squadrons had put to sea some time since, notwithstanding the extreme vigilance of our fleets. He understood also, that no intelligence whatever had yet arrived as to their destination, which probably would be heard of when they had struck a dreadful blow in some quarter. It could not be said therefore, that we were in perfect security, or that the danger had passed. When the country was thus situated, he submitted to the house that this bill should be repealed; for, if continued, it would obstruct the raising of a supply for the army, and if removed, a better plan might be substituted.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01537"><member>Mr. Bragge Bathurst,</member><membercontribution> in reply to the hon. gent's, (Mr. Sheridan's) appeal to the friends of the late minister, thought it right to observe that it did not follow, because a measure had been opposed before it received the sanction of parliament, that it should also be opposed afterwards, He appealed to the house, whether such had been the practice of parliament, or whether opposition, in the first instance, was supposed to imply the necessity of continued resistance? Most of the measures which many gentlemen thought to be objectionable at first, were amended in their progress through the house; and consequently, when stamped with the approbation of parliament, were entitled to concurrence and support. As to the present subject, the question appeared to be, whether it had received a fair trial; but he thought not; and therefore that it should not be repealed on light ground. If he were asked whether he preferred the army of reserve to the defence bill, he should answer in the affirmative; but it could not be inferred, in sound reasoning, that he ought therefore to oppose the latter. Before he assented to the repeal of the present bill, or rather before he was called on to do so, it was the duty of the gentlemen who proposed it to bring forward their plan, in order that he might be able to decide on its superior efficacy and advantages. If this bill fee repealed, there is no substitute for it as
<image src="S1V0003P0I0400"/>
<col>771</col>
yet; and we must depend, of course, on the voluntary zeal of the country. As the reserve act was repealed, parliament should keep this substitute, otherwise the force of the country would be completely unhinged, and the public councils justly charged with inconsistency and fluctuation, which surely ought to be guarded against. He did not approve of the plan proposed for limited service, because it could not be sufficiently expeditious for the pressure of the moment, nor did he think it at all likely to be attended with the success which was sanguinely expected by some gentlemen from its adoption. As to the fines, he should say that they must be enforced, and if the country supposed that parliament was not in earnest, no progress could be made with this bill, or its merits be fairly tried. The right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer pledged himself that the measure should not operate as a tax, and therefore he thought that alarm on that head ought to be wholly removed. He did not know on what ground the hon. gent. (Mr. Sheridan) appealed to him and the friends of the late minister for their support on this occasion, when that hon. gent. or his friends, had not voted with the late administration; on the contrary, they even partially supported this very measure against the noble lord (Sidmouth). The hon. gent. even with all his professions, the sincerity of which he by no means questioned, and with all the feelings which he expressed for the noble lord alluded to, had not, he believed, given him one vote during his administration. Hence no application could be made for the support of the noble lord's friends on the ground of reciprocity or interchange of interests. When this plan of offence was opened by the right hon. gent, then out of office, it had the cordial support of gent. on the other side of the house, and they did not oppose it until he proposed it at the head of an administration of which they formed no part. Both he and those with whom he acted, performed a painful duty, when, in its conscientious discharge, they resisted this bill, and endeavoured to maintain the former; and he believed they were now of one mind, to support the present under the existing circumstances. The gentlemen who had conducted this business, had a little incautiously disclosed the secret; they said, plainly, that the question was not so much what new scheme of military defence should be adopted, as to what ministers,
<col>772</col>
in future, the military defence of this country, whatever it might be, should be intrusted. To increase their strength, they had invited the country gentlemen to inlist under their banners. The gentlemen of that description were respectable for their property, for their character, for their numbers, and for their attainments; and they would not oppose that bill from the views on the opposite side of the house, so evident and palpable; they knew it was not only necessary to have a competent force to attack the enemy, but to have united councils; and that the security of the country depended on the one, and on the other. On these grounds he should oppose this motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01538"><member>Lord Archibald Hamilton</member><membercontribution> observed, that he should support the motion for repealing the bill, from a thorough conviction of its inefficiency. It tended directly to destroy the recruiting system, which was proved from the circumstance of the regimental officers having been as successful as could be wished, till this bill had been introduced into the parishes, when all the sources of supplying the army in the ordinary way were instantly dried up. It had defeated itself completely, and when compared with the promises made, must be acknowledged to be quite nugatory.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01539"><member>Mr. Fuller</member><membercontribution> disapproved of the speech of the right lion. gent.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01540"><member>Mr. Tierney</member><membercontribution> thought it necessary to say a few words, after the example of a right hon. friend of his (Mr. B. Bathurst). He disclaimed any idea of giving a factious opposition to the govt.; but he felt it incumbent on him to declare, that with all the consideration he had been enabled to give the additional force act, if the repeal of it depended upon his single vote, he should think it his duty to vote in the affirmative, and upon grounds that were perfectly satisfactory to his own mind. Conscientiously speaking, he was firmly convinced of the wisdom of the military plans of that administration with which he had been connected; and as this bill went to render null the whole of them, he thought him-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0401"/>
<col>773</col>
self, upon principles of consistency, obliged to vote for its repeal. The right hon. gent. here entered into a very clear and elaborate justification of the measures of defence resorted to by the late administration. Their object in suspending the army of reserve act, was to relieve the country from a very onerous pressure, and to employ those milder measures which they had reason to think would be more efficient. The right hon. member then enumerated the various modes which they had proposed for recruiting the army, all of which, and particularly the raising eight battalions for rank, he defended against the unmerited imputations which had been lavished on them. His great objections to the bill, which it was moved to repeal, were founded on constitutional grounds, and never could, by any temporary, or even the greatest possible success, be wholly done away. It tended to. create a great permanent standing army, a description of force which had ever been regarded with a constitutional jealousy in that house. Operating as an amercement, it was oppressive beyond measure; the effect of it would be, to say to the parishes, you shall be heavily fined; you shall be subject to the payment of extravagant and burdensome impositions, unless you can get men to work cheaper than they find it to be their interest or inclination to do. Not wishing this measure should stand in the way of that popularity which he perceived the administration was anxious to obtain, he was desirous that it should not go forward. The country was convinced it had failed, and, therefore, confidently expected its repeal. Even if it had succeeded to the most sanguine wishes of the. proposers, on the return of peace he should have thought it the duty of the house to repeal it. He felt himself bound, upon principles of consistency, and wishing to. pay those marks of respect and affection to the late administration, which he felt they, deserved from him, and which, perhaps, at no distant period, the country would feel were due to them, to vote in support of the motion</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01541"><member>Mr. Fox.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;Sir; at this late hour, and after the very ample discussion this subject has already obtained, I shall detain the house but for a very few moments. A right hon. gent. (Mr. Bragge Bathurst) has said, that it is not fair to ask him to state upon his honour what would have been his
<col>774</col>
conduct with respect to any measure in different circumstances; and that it is sufficient for him to give his honest opinion of it when it comes before him. The right hon. gent. last year stated his sentiments on this very bill; and though he has not thought proper to tell us what the sentiments of himself. and his noble relation (lord Sidmouth) oh the subject were, previous to the late reconciliation, I cannot help believing that they must have formed some opinion in the course of the summer. The right hon. gent. says, too, that it never entered into his contemplation, or into the minds of those persons who, as well, as himself, have been alluded to by my hon. friend, the mover of the present motion, to engage in a litigious, a vexatious, and a factious opposition to government. Doubtless, they would not engage. in an opposition which they themselves thought so; and they may fairly suppose that others would not do so, or at least confess that their opposition was litigious and vexatious. This declaration of the right hon. gent. does not surprize me to any great degree; for when I recollect the opposition which he himself gave to the very bill of. which my hon. friend now proposes the repeal, I cannot, I say, help believing, that he and his friends did, in the course of the autumn, come to some mature consideration as to how they should vote, not only upon this bill, so much the object of their former animadversion, but possibly, upon every other measure of the present government. But the distinction of the right hon. gent. is extremely curious. When the measure was first proposed in June last, then the opposition given to it by the right hon. gent. and his friends was fair, manly, and honourable; but now that it has totally failed, now that it is scouted from one end of the kingdom to the other, any opposition to it is stigmatised as being litigious, factious, vexatious, and I know not what. But the right hon. gent. puts another notable case. He says that those who oppose a war do not always move for peace. This is true, because it is not an easy matter to repeal a war like an act of parliament; and when a war is once commenced, it is not practicable at any moment to obtain a peace, nor may it be prudent to move for it. But surely this case has no analogy whatever to an act of parliament which experience has condemned; a measure which, professing to raise men, imposes only an oppressive and un-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0402"/>
<col>775</col>
equal tax on the community. Can any man doubt of its failure? Suppose the right hon. gent. opposite to me were to come forward in his official situation, and propose and recommend, with all his powers of persuasion, a tax to the house, which he should state as likely to produce two millions, and which in the sequel should only be productive to the amount of a twentieth part of that sum, what would the house, and what would the public think of him? Would not those who originally opposed this tax, who forewarned him, and who foretold him that it would be inefficient, would they not, I say, feel themselves bound to move for the repeal of it? It has been insinuated by the right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer, that on the division on the motion of my right hon. friend (Mr. Windham) the other night, we retired into the lobby rather reluctantly and sulkily. For myself I can assure the right hon. gent. that I quilted the house with no feelings of that sort; but when it is considered, that I had the honour to submit a similar motion last session to the house, in which I had the concurrence of upwards of 200 members, and that this year the number is under 100; when it is considered, that that right hon. gent. by whom I am so little in the habit of being supported, and of whose support, therefore, I am covetous, did on that occasion vote for my motion, and that without any change in our situation, except this identical bill, he on that night voted against a motion precisely similar, it would not have been very surprising if some degree of chagrin on this side of the house had been discovered.&#x2014;It has been objected by a right hon. gent. (Mr. Bragge Bathurst) intimately connected with the head of the last administration, that there are material differences of opinion with respect to the military system fit to be adopted among gentlemen with whom I have the satisfaction to act. The members of the junction or coalition on this side of the house may possibly differ on some trifling particulars; for instance, I and my right hon. friend (Mr. Windham) do, as it happens, entertain rather different sentiments from my hon. friend the mover of the question, respecting the volunteers. Yet, surely, these differences of opinion with regard to the volunteer system, are not now for the first time announced; and last year, though fully as great as now, they formed no objection to the right hon.
<col>776</col>
gent. the present chancellor of the exchequer's voting along with persons so differing, for a committee of the whole house to consider of the military defence of the country. Those differences, indeed, it has never been attempted to disguise. I suspect, however, that the coalition on the other side will never be arraigned for any such difference of opinion. On the contrary, when I consider the circumstances under which it was effected, the time at which it took place, and the purposes for which it was brought about, I have no doubt that both sides will bring with them such a pleasing disposition to mutual agreement and mutual forgiveness, that there never will be any more differences between them. The right hon. gent. on the floor has talked of a junction and a coalition of discordant parties. But let me tell the right hon. gent. that he is the last man iii the world who ought to throw out taunts against that coalition. Did he find fault with it last year? Would he be sitting in the place he now occupies if it were not for that coalition? Would the "weak, imbecile administration," as he called it, have been turned out? Or, to complete the climax, does he believe that this bill would have passed, if that junction which he now treats with contempt had not been effected? With respect to the question of coalitions, my right hon. friend (Mr. Windham), has, in my opinion, said quite enough to repel any charge of that kind. I have always been of opinion, that unless public men can be persuaded to lay aside their animosities on past transactions, which do not necessarily influence their conduct in different circumstances, it would be impossible to continue that species of government which has existed in this country since the revolution. For instance, what is there to hinder those who formerly differed about the American war from agreeing as to the policy of this country towards American independence? Or what is there to prevent those who differed about the late French war, from concurring in the measures to be adopted in another war? But what has been the conduct of the right hon. gent? What were the grounds of his opposition to the late administration? It was not this or that measure that he objected to, but he arraigned the whole of their measures as the offspring of folly, weakness, and Heaven knows what else! Did he not publicly brand them with the epithets incapable and imbecile? Did he
<image src="S1V0003P0I0403"/>
<col>777</col>
not insinuate that they had as little honour as sense? And has he not restored all those weak and incapable men to the ministry, with all their unfitness? Even all this violence and personality could be surmounted, and the right hon. gent. may say to his new allies, "though I called you fool, though I called you imbecile, though I represented you as not possessing more virtue than understanding, yet now I have got your places, I don't care if you are regarded as a very meritorious, sensible set of people."&#x2014;I know it is not regular to advert to what took place on a former debate, but before I proceed to examine the bill itself, I wish just to take notice of an observation made by a right hon. gent. (Mr. Canning), that besides the vast merits of this bill, the improvement of our naval situation has been so great as of itself to be an argument against any inquiry. The right hon. gent. has thrown out a challenge respecting the merits of the late and present naval department, which, I trust, will in the course of the present session, be accepted; when possibly, the late board of admiralty, which has been subjected to so much uncalled-for censure on the part of the right hon. gent. opposite me, may, when they come to be weighed against each other, be found to possess as much vigour as the present.&#x2014;All those who recollect the speech of the right hon. gent. when he proposed this famous bill, which was to work such instantaneous prodigies, must remember that the professed object of it was to raise "forthwith" a very considerable number of men. But what has it done? The prospect held out was, that it would procure an immediate force of 18,000 men before October last, and a farther supply of 9,000 were to be added before October 1805, being in all 27,000 men. But what is the fact? This measure, which we were pompously told was calculated for the immediate exigency, had in the first 15 weeks produced only 1581 men in England, Ireland, and Scotland; and of these 1581, only 640 were raised between the 15th of Sept. and the 6th of Nov; but supposing, for the sake of argument, that those 1581 were all raised in England within 15 weeks, that would be no justification of the bill; for the question is not about 6O or 100 or 200 men a week. It must now produce 850 per week, in order to complete the number which it ought to raise before October next. Who, then, will contend that the bill has not completely and totally failed?
<col>778</col>
When the right hon gent. triumphantly promised and pledged himself, that its operation would produce, within a certain time, 27,000 men, the difficulties, the innumerable difficulties in the way of its execution were foretold to him. It has been said, that the bill was carried by a small majority, and that it had to encounter the effect of much opposition. I do not believe that any obstacle whatever, arising from this cause, has been opposed to the bill. But did I not, at the time, warn the right hon. gent. not to push this bill against the sense of the majority of the English members of parliament, because even a measure, the principle of which might be good, could not be advantageously brought forward, against the sense of the public at large? It is said, too, that expectations have gone abroad, that the bill would be repealed. But what sort of a defence of a measure is it to say, that its absurdities are so palpable and its inefficacy so manifest, that all men believed it was to be repealed; and is not this to acknowledge, rather than to palliate the failure? A noble lord (Sidmouth) formerly a member of this house, but now at the head of his majesty's council (for the right hon. gent. is extremely tenacious of the singular number on this occasion) did, on the bringing in of this bill, propose that it should be postponed until the ensuing session, in order to ascertain the sense of the country respecting it, in the interval. I confess I was one who did not approve of that advice, as the right hon. gent. promised that his bill would produce immediate benefit and assistance. It is somewhat strange, however, that now, when it has been tried and found totally inefficient, the same right hon. gent. should step forward, and tell us that it ought not to be repealed. It has unquestionably failed as to men; and the right hon. gent. has disclaimed any idea of ever employing it as an instrument of taxation, and to this declaration I am disposed to give implicit belief. It is impossible that any one, standing in his situation, could ever resort to so infamous, so vexatious, and so unequal a mode of taxation. For, how is it to be employed? Why, as a threat. It is not the fine but the dread of the parish officers that is to get the men. A more flagrant instance of oppression never was heard of in the history of the world. It is a principle that is in itself a reason for the repeal of this bill. We are told that the bill has assisted the recruiting for the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0404"/>
<col>779</col>
regular army. But in what manner has it done so? Is it not merely by the negative parts of it, by suspending the competition and the high bounties? Acting with my right hon. friend (Mr. Windham), and acting under him, as I shall always be proud to do, we always said that such would be its effects, when this bill came into active operation, and yet this which is- now held out as one of the merits of the bill, was formerly ridiculed as the suggestion of a wild and fanciful imagination. Such are the miserable shifts to which the advocates of the bill are driven for arguments in its defence! The right hon. gent has said, that the object of my hon. friend's motion is the removal of a minister. The right hon gent. with great humility, professes his readiness to bow to the decision of the house, but I suspect he is pretty sure that such decision will not be against him; for I remember, when he was rather more in danger last year, he was not disposed to be quite so obedient. I do think that the right hon. gent. is bound in honour and in generosity to state his recantation of all the opprobrious and contemptuous terms in which he spoke of the late administration; for I do maintain, that whatever there is of vigour or energy in his military plans is solely to be attributed to the measures adopted by his predecessors. I am willing to admit that I was one of those who wished for the return of the right hon. gent to office, in preference to those whom he succeeded. The right hon. gent. therefore owes it to those who assisted in the overthrow of the late ministry, deeming them unfit for their stations, to shew that he is more able, more vigorous, and more energetic than they were. He owes it to his own honour and reputation, to furnish some better proof of his superior claims to the confidence of the nation than such a miserable bill as the present. No man is more disposed to subscribe to the great talents of the right hon. gent. than I am. No man, in the, course of the many years we have been opposed to each, other, has had more reason to subscribe to them; but if any thing could allow me to entertain a doubt of the wisdom and ability of the right hon. gent. it would be the imprudence of staking his reputation on this bill, the operation of which does not furnish one argument which the partiality of friendship can possibly consider as the mark of an enlarged and vigorous mind.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01542"><member>Lord Castlereagh.</member><membercontribution>&#x2014;It is not my intention,
<col>780</col>
sir, at this late hour, to trouble the house with many observations upon a subject which has been so amply discussed, and upon which the luminous speech of my right hon. friend has left me little or nothing to say. But if I did feel myself inclined to enter at large into the question, the gentlemen on the other side of the house would have no reason to conplain seeing that they have repeatedly, called for it. Nothing; however, has been offered by them which in my mind, affects any one, of those fundamental principles upon which the bill is established, and I really feel a considerable difficulty in replying to the vague and unconnected objections which have been advanced against it. The gentlemen who have opposed this bill, have hitherto suggested nothing to supply its place, and I do hope and believe, that a large majority of this house will concur with me in thinking that the <i>onus</i> lays with the other side of the house to make out such a sufficient case as shall induce parliament to rescind its own resolution and to alter the whole military system of the country. I maintain, that the bill has not, as yet, had a fair trial. I maintain, that it is working the most salutary effects throughout the country, and that when the progressive quality of the measure is candidly examined it will clearly appear that it ought to be continued. I am ready to admit, with gentlemen on the other side of the house, that the operation of the bill commenced on the 5th of Sept. instead of the 15th of Nov. The average produce from the 5th of Sept. a period of 26 weeks, is 131 men per week; for the last 16 weeks, 169 men per week; for the last 12 weeks, 184 men per week; and for the last 8 weeks, 203 men per week. Therefore, supposing this regularly progressive quality of the measure to continue, it will in the course of 52 weeks produce no less than 10,500 men; and this being the case, I would ask any gentleman whether such a measure can justly be called inefficient? One of the great advantages arising from it is, that it does not interfere with the ordinary means of recruiting for the army. With regard to the oppressive quality of the measure, if by oppressive is meant inconvenient, I readily grant that in some instances it may prove so, But, if a great and extensive military measure must be resorted to, I should be glad to know, what milder one can the country be called upon to submit to than the one which has been
<image src="S1V0003P0I0405"/>
<col>781</col>
adopted? If we compare it with any measure which this country has known, it is impossible not to acknowledge that it is far milder in its operation than all the preceding ones. If we compare it with the Army of Reserve act, the presumption is tenfold in favour of this bill. I always considered the exertions of the parish officers as so much clear gain. In Ireland they have raised four-fifths of the whole number which has been raised. In England, Ireland, and Scotland, their exertions have been as four to one. I cannot help regretting that we should hear the existing branches of the military defence of the country so much run down and depreciated as we have done of late. A right hon. gent. (Mr. Windham) holds them all extremely cheap. He holds the volunteer establishment cheap to a degree. That we do not at present possess a great and efficient army is what I will never consent to admit. I maintain that our regular efficient force amounts at this time to 252,000 men, and that the country is placed in a very high state of defence. I am prepared to say, that we can at any time detach a very large and powerful army to any point where it may be required, and that there is a reasonable prospect, if we continue to act on our present military system, that we shall possess such a disposable force as will enable us to undertake any offensive operations that may be deemed necessary for the honour and security of the empire.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01543"><member>Mr. Johnstone</member><membercontribution> rose, he said, for the purpose of pointing out several fallacies in the statement made by the noble lord, but a general call for the question prevented us from correctly hearing the hon. gent.'s calculations.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01544"><member>Mr. Sheridan</member><membercontribution> then rose to reply, and spoke nearly as follows:&#x2014;After the attentive hearing with which I was honoured in the former part of the evening, I think the house will do me the credit to believe that it is not my intention to trespass much on their time at this late period. I shall, however, avail myself of the privilege granted to the opener of a motion, to say a few words in reply to the objections which have been started against the motion which I have had the honour to submit to the house. I can assure the house, that what I have to say shall be short, for though I value volunteering very highly, I certainly am not over zealous to reply to speeches which were totally destitute of any thing in the shape of argument. I was not sur-

prized that the noble lord felt so forcibly that he and his friends were called on for some answer, and to state their reasons for still supporting this bill. If they had given no answer, it might very fairly have been inferred, that it was because they had no answer to give. In their answer, however, they took care to avoid the main objections that had been urged on this side of the house; namely, that the bill was unconstitutional in its principle, and had completely failed in its effect. The noble lord, however, conceives that the argument of the bill not having been fairly tried was quite too strong for the great abilities of my hon. friend (Mr. Fox) to combat; but, in no part of my hon. friend's speech did he more successfully grapple with the arguments of the supporters of the bill, than where he demonstrated that no future trial could possibly reconcile parliament and the country to it. The noble lord complains that the operation of the bill in Scotland and Ireland has been purposely passed over. But let it be recollected, that the bill to which the present motion immediately applies is confined to England, and has nothing whatever to do with Scotland or Ireland. And here, sir, I cannot help reminding the house, that the bill was carried against the sense of a considerable majbrity of the representatives of England. I do not mean to dispute the right of the members for the other parts of the United Kingdom to vote on such questions; but it is not difficult to conceive, that members for Scotland and Ireland by voting in support of a minister, on a question which does not affect their own constituents, might expect to have something conceded to them in the two bills which were to follow. The bill for Scotland has, however, failed still more than the one now under consideration. In Ireland, I am ready to admit, that proportionably more men have been raised by the parishes, but not one volunteer has inlisted for general service, which was the professed object of the bill. The right hon. the chancellor of the exchequer has told us, that if the bill should prove a measure of taxation, he will be the very first man to move for its repeat. Now it does appear, that altogether only 1250 men have been raised by the bill in England, and after deducting deaths and casualties, 681 is the number of men actually recruited by the parishes; consequently the remainder have been raised by fines and penalties, or, in other words, by
<image src="S1V0003P0I0406"/>
<col>783</col>
taxation. The right hon. gent. complains that I used harsh and violent language towards him, that I wandered from the subject in discussion, and sought to supply the defect of argument by personal reflections. Although I may be supposed to be sometimes a warm speaker in this house, I believe I have never been accused of harbouring much political animosity against any man. The right hon. gent. intended, I suppose, to contrast my violent language with his own singular gentleness and meekness of manners. This observation, he doubtless thought, came with peculiar propriety from a person of his own blushing humility; from a person so perfectly averse to all like ill-natured personalities; so eminently distinguished for soaring above all little political enmities, and so complete a foe to every thing sarcastic or biting. The right lion. gent. has thought proper to describe my speech as coming from a person who has never read the act it is proposed to repeal, and who knows nothing of it beyond its title. What I said is regarded by him as a collection of jests and sarcasms which have been for a long time stored up, in order that they may burst all at once on the meek, gentle, modest, but devoted head of the right hon. gent. If my speech, however, was so very unworthy of the serious attention of the house; if I did wander so very much from the object of the debate; if I did entertain the house with nothing but hoarded repartees or common-place jokes, is it not a little singular that the right hon. gent. should have done me the honour to start up immediately to answer me? The right hon. gent. well knew that his vast and splendid talents were not necessary to answer a speech, distinguished for nothing but irregularity:
<quote>Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus</quote>
is a maxim which no man better understands than the right hon. gent. Why did he not on this, as on a former occasion, employ a substitute? The right hon. gent. supposes I said that when he went out of office he stood high in the opinion of the public. I said no such thing. I said, that he stood comparatively higher than when he returned to power. But though the right hon. gent. has replied to this observation, he has thought proper to take no notice of the reasons on which it was founded. Not a word of a certain pledge to the. Catholics of Ireland which he is known to have give on his abandonment
<col>784</col>
of the office to which he has since returned! No man is more ready to acknowledge the great and eminent talents of the right hon. gent. than I am. No man esteems them higher than I do. But if I were to characterize his ministry, I should say, in language which the right hon. gent. may recollect to have heard before, namely "that he has added more to the burdens and subtracted more from the liberties of the people, than any minister that ever governed this country."&#x2014;The right hon. gent. has attacked me for bringing charges against his colleagues, who were not in this house to defend themselves, and has taken up the glove for the First Lord of the Admiralty. For my part, I really entertain a respect for the noble lord (Melville) as a man of business; certainly there are many differences between him and his predecessor. He does not, like the noble earl, pin himself down to his desk by four in the morning, examing into abuses, but he goes boldly afloat himself to superintend, or rather to judge with critical eyes (occulis subjecta fidelibus) of the explosion of his own catamarans, I will not call in question how nice an ear the noble lord may have for the blowing up of a carcase; nor do I wish to allude to the festivities at Walmer Castle, where the right hon. gent. opposite me had prepared a sort of Alexander's Feast, and where he and his friends were anxiously wailing for the noble lord's triumphal return:
<quote>The jolly God in triumph comes,</quote>
<quote>Sound the trumpets, beat the drums.</quote>
Whether or not there was a Timotheus of their party report does not say; the jolly God however was not absent. There, like Alexander, "he seized a torch with fury to destroy," and if he did not succeed, I suppose it was because there was no Thais at Walmer to lead the way.&#x2014;The right hon. gent. has thought fit to allude to the support which I gave to the noble lord (Sidmouth) now at the head of his majesty's council, when that noble lord was chancellor of the exchequer. He represents it as an insiduous and hollow support. I hope it is not my character to give any support of that description. He says I gave the noble lord a few votes when I knew they could be of no use to him, and that I opposed him when my support could alone have been of advantage to him. I say that this charge is contrary to fact. I gave my support to the late administration with the most perfect good faith, and I know that the noble lord has always been ready to
<image src="S1V0003P0I0407"/>
<col>785</col>
acknowledge it. But, supposing I had not supported him with fidelity and firmness. What then? I never had professed to do so, either to that administration, or to this house. I supported them because I approved of many of their measures, but principally was I induced to support them, because I considered their continuance in office as a security against the return to power of the right hon. gent. opposite me, which ever appeared to me as the greatest national calamity. If, indeed, I had recommended the noble lord to his majesty;&#x2014;if I had come down to this house, and described the noble lord as the fittest man in the country to fill the office of chancellor of the exchequer, because it was a convenient step to my own safety, in retiring from a situation which I had grossly abused and which I could no longer fill with honour and security;&#x2014;if, having seduced him into that situation, I had afterwards tapered off from a promised support, when I saw that the minister of my own choice was acquiring greater stability and popularity than I wished for;&#x2014;if, when t saw an opening to my own return to power, I had entered into a combination with others, whom I meant also to betray, from the sole lust of power and office, in Order to remove him;&#x2014;and if, under the dominion of these base appetites I had then treated with ridicule and contempt, the very man whom I had before held up to the choice of my sovereign, and the approbation of this house and the public;&#x2014;then, indeed, I should have merited the contempt and execration of all good men, and should have deserved to be told, that I was hollow and insincere in my support, and that I had acted a mean, a base, and a perfidious part.&#x2014;The house then divided, when there appeared,

Certain claims which would then be submitted to the committee would, he understood, involve two points on which it might be necessary for their lordships to bestow some consideration. The points were these: that previous to the act of 1782 which established the independence of Ireland, several patents, creating peers of that country, were granted under the great seal of G. Britain, and not under the great seal of Ireland. Subsequent to that period, also, patents of a similar nature were likewise granted under the great seal of G. Britain, and not under the great seal of Ireland. He mentioned these two points, in order that their lordships might turn them in their minds, previous to the committee; they would recollect' at the same time, that they would not have to decide upon any claim to the peerage, but merely as to the right of voting at the election of peers for Ireland. Upon further consideration, he thought it would be better to postpone the consideration of these claims, from Tuesday to Thursday, on which latter day they might have the assistance of the Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, who would then; be able to attend.&#x2014;The consideration of the claims alluded to, was accordingly postponed till Thursday.&#x2014;Adjourned.</p>

<title>[SALT DUTY BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01550"><member>Mr. Alexander</member><membercontribution> appeared at the bar with the report of the bill for imposing an additional duty on salt. On the question being put from the chair, "that this report be now brought up,"</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01551"><member>Mr. Johnstone</member><membercontribution> observed, that though the subject might appear to have been pretty nearly exhausted already, yet he could not refrain at this time from stating his objections to the bill, which he considered as involving in it every thing mischievous that could possibly accompany a tax. It was surprising, that after a report of the committee of this house had been so long on the table, recommending the entire abolition of the salt duty, the first thing we should hear was a double duty being laid on that article. It was a breach of faith-in some measure, and must give the country a bad impression of parliament itself. Suppose a case in private life, where a superior should hold out hopes to a dependant, that he should be relieved from grievances of which he justly complained: what would be thought of that superior if, instead of relief, he should double the burden It was trifling with the people to hold out expectations to them without attempting to realize them. So much for England. But the case was worse with respect to Scotland. There it would be impossible to go through with this bill. Formerly when the duty was 10s. in England, in Scotland it was 6s. 6d. From this it was found necessary to lower it to 4s. If it was scarcely possible to collect it then, what could be done now, when the duty was so much more? The difficulty of making salt in Scotland would not account for the impossibility found in collecting the duty there. This difficulty arose from-making salt there from sea water, instead of salt springs, which contained more saline matter; but in Scotland, they used the rock salt of Chester in general, as well as, in- England. The tax fell much more severely on the poor than
<image src="S1V0003P0I0409"/>
<col>789</col>
on the rich, for a poor man especially in Scotland, was compelled to live principally on vegetable food, which required a great quantity of salt to stimulate digestion. The net produce of the tax in Scotland was 47,000l. This sum was nearly all expended in bounties to the Herring Fishery, and in the charges of collection, and therefore scarcely any thing was gained by it to the public. The design of the society for improving the Highlands, as appeared from their reports, was to prevent, as much as possible, the augmentation of the tax on salt, which had so bad an effect on the Herring Fishery. In the year 1769, in the Isle of Man, where the duty did not exist, the inhabitants were about 7000. They had since increased to 30,000, chiefly, perhaps, owing to their exemption from this duty. He had another objection to the tax, which was, that this heavy burden was laid on the people, for paying the interest of five millions subsidy to be given to the powers on the continent. We had no information of the nature of the services to be performed for it. It was vain to subsidize the northern powers, because, in order to make an impression on France, the co-operation of one, or both of the great powers contiguous to France was necessary.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01552"><member>Mr. Rose</member><membercontribution> insisted, that the different bounties to which the committee and the hon. gent, alluded, on the exportation of printed linens and cottons, whale oil, refined sugar, &amp;c. had no connection whatever with the duties imposed upon salt. The gentlemen who opposed this duty in the present instance, and even wished for the repeal of all the duties upon salt, would find themselves under very great difficulty to point out a substitute which would produce a revenue of 500,000l. and not be liable to much greater objection than this was. He denied that the duty at all had any application to the fisheries, which were exempted, and stated, that in the course of the present session, he hoped to be enabled to bring in a bill for the better encouragement and regulation of the fisheries.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01553"><member>Mr. Kinnaird</member><membercontribution> said, that when the report of the committee of 1801 was ordered to be reprinted, he thought there was reason to expect that it would have been before the house before the bill should be pressed -forward. He wished to remind the house, that in recommending the taking off the duty on salt, that the committee illustrated the advantages of it, by slating that all the prosperity of the Isle of Man was ow-
<col>790</col>
ing to the free exportation of salt, but since the union, the parliament of this country found it impossible to raise the same duties in Scotland as in Englandi When the union took place in 1707, there was a salt duty of 6d. per bushel in Scotland, and from that time they never paid any duty till the year 1725, when an addition was proposed, which it was aftewards found necessary to repeal. He contended, that the salt duties in Scotland could never be made to amount to more than 45,000l. a year, as there was a great chymical difference between the salt produced from sea-water in that country, and what was in England produced from springs impregnated with rock salt, insomuch that one bushel of Liverpool salt was equal to three bushels of Scotch salt.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01554"><member>Mr. Huskisson</member><membercontribution> observed, that the difference to which the hon. member had alluded had been formerly considered by parliament, but that was done for the relief of the manufacturer, and not for the benefit of the consumer. As to the consideration of the northern fisheries, parliament would doubtless continue the same bounties to them as had been granted for a century past. The allusion which another hon. member had made to a situation in common life, was not exactly analogous; in Ins opinion the comparison would be more correctly made with the situation of a sailor who complained to his captain of the hardships which he suffered while at sea in tempestuous weather; and the captain gave him hopes that he should have better weather, and said that he then would have less labour. However, contrary to the expectation of the captain, the gale rose with considerable increased fury, when he had thought that it had nearly subsided, and the vessel sprung a leak. The captain then says, now you must do double work, for, if you don't work away at the pumps, the ship will inevitably sink; there is no other means of saving her. Now, if any other measure of equal benefit to the sate could be proposed, he should be very glad to hear it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01555"><member>Mr. Hurst</member><membercontribution> said, that the policy of parliament had always been to spare, amongst the objects of taxation, as much as possible, the indispensable necessaries of life, and he should therefore give his strenuous opposition to a duty which went to raise the price of all articles of human sustenance, in which salt was made use of. It was the duly of his majesty's ministers, when a tax was fairly objected to, to endeavour to find out
<image src="S1V0003P0I0410"/>
<col>791</col>
some other fund to defray the expences of the state.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01556"><member>Colonel Calcraft</member><membercontribution> said, that though he did not wish to stop the progress of the bill during the printing of the report of the committee; yet he did not suppose that any attempt would have been made to pass the bill through the house until the report should be before them. He said, that though this might not be a fit time for taking off the tax altogether, yet he could1 not think the present was the fittest moment to select for adding 500,0001. to the 800,000l. which is already raised from an article of general consumption, as the lower order must feel peculiarly the inconvenience of a time of war, from the advance which takes place in the price of provisions in consequence of the increase of taxes, which is unavoidably occasioned by the war. When such a subject, however, was to be discussed in parliament, he thought it would have been more respectful to the house for the minister to have attended in his place. He had not heard that he was ill, or that any unpleasant consequences had followed from the fatigue of last night's debate; he might have been a little galled no doubt, but that was no reason why he should not attend in his place to-night, on the discussion of a subject of such general importance. Instead of adopting such a measure as the present, he would advise the Colleagues of that right hon. gent, to take the liberty of recommending him in private to look at economy in the public expenditure. When his majesty's servants thought proper to have recourse to severe taxes of this kind, he thought it was full time to endeavour to find a substitute for them in the retrenchments, which were so loudly called for in the public expenditure. An hon. admiral (Markham) of high authority, had lately stated, (see p. 684), that a saving of one-third might be made in the naval expenditure, which was now 15 million annually; and if they could retrench even one thirteenth part of it, the people of the country might be saved some of the hardships to which they were now subjected. Should this tax be adopted, the consequence must be that every labouring and Agricultural man in the country would have to pay a twentieth part of his income for the, purchase of salt indispensable for his sustenance.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01557"><member>Mr. W. Smith</member><membercontribution> said, that many things which he had intended to have offered had been in a great measure anticipated. He would;
<col>792</col>
however, beg leave to add a few words to what had been said on this subject. There, were many people who carried on manufactories for soap in a small way, who used wood ashes instead of the barilla, used by the great manufacturers. They had stated to him that their profits had almost entirely been swallowed up by the late duty on salt. They would now therefore be entirely ruined. One great object with government was the encouragement of the herring fishery, and the right hon. gent. (Mr. Rose) had said that he intended to bring in a bill for that purpose; but no encouragement could ever be effectual without the repeal of the salt duty. He had been on the committee which made the report so often mentioned. The right hon. gent, had said, that that committee had stated that various bounties might be withdrawn if the salt duties were repealed, though these bounties were given for things having no connection with salt. He would perhaps find, however, that in these works salt was employed, otherwise the committee must have been devoid of common sense, which he knew they were not. The restrictions and revenue laws must be multiplied in consequence of this duty. The difficulty of finding a substitute would be increased by the additional duty. He concluded by reading a statement made to him by a person who had long been in the employment of the fishery, explaining the ruinous effects of being restricted as to the quantity of salt used; and said that the salt duty was certainly one of the greatest impediments to the improvement of the fisheries that at present existed.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01558"><member>Mr. Sturges Bourne</member><membercontribution> stated, that the report of this committee had been ordered to be reprinted under an impression, that the printing of it should not cause any delay to the bill. The salt duty was collected at an expence of only 2 per cent, being less than any other tax required in the collection. The fisheries could not be effected by the tax, as they would continue still to have the duty free.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01559"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> said, that there was one point which he wished to have exactly ascertained. It seemed to be agreed that the salt of Scotland was inferior in quality to that of England. He wished to know exactly the degree of difference between them. On the one hand great injustice might be done to Scotland, in case the consumption was great, and on the other hand, in case the food used in Scotland was much easier
<image src="S1V0003P0I0411"/>
<col>793</col>
cured, such as salt-fish, than the food in England, then some injustice might be done to the poor of England. He wished to know exactly how much more than a peck of salt in Scotland, it would take to render it perfectly equal to our English peck. &#x2014;The repost was then brought up, and agreed to, and the bill ordered to be read a third time on Monday.&#x2014;Adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[DEFENCE OF THE COUNTRY.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01560">The order of the day for summoning their lordships to consider of the motion upon this subject being read,</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01561"><member>Lord King</member><membercontribution> rose, and observed, he thought that no apology was necessary for calling the attention of that house to the subject upon which he had announced his intention to bring forward a motion; its intrinsic importance and great magnitude, were so evident as obviously to render any thing of the kind unnecessary. In discussing a subject the nature of which was equally extensive, various, and important, a variety of arguments and considerations, founded on the multiplicity of facts, presented themselves to his mind; but among those which struck him, as the most prominent and forcible, was the contradictory nature, as well as the great inefficacy of the different measures of the two last sessions, for ameliorating the military system, and augmenting the military force of the country. The perusal of these, he thought, would be sufficient to convince every discerning and unprejudiced mind of the total absence of all system, regularity, and connection, in the various measures which had been devised, It was impossible, from the consideration of the acts alluded to, to collect that even the intention of the framers was to create a disposable force in the country. Neither in the plans which had been adopted, or in the course of their execution, could such an object or intention be traced. In the measures which had been suggested, there was nothing like order, regularity, or system; every step that had been taken added to the difficulties, and departed wider from the attainment of the proposed object. Such was the conduct of the government on these occasions, that it reminded him of the situation of an unfortunate man plunged into an abyss of difficulty and distress, who was glad to catch at, or lay hold of, every thing that presented itselt,
<col>794</col>
however slight and powerless, in order to extricate himself. His lordship then proceeded to a detailed consideration of the subject, and first adverted to the measures of increasing the militia, and the creation of what was called the Army of Reserve, the prominent effects of which were to raise the bounties to an extravagantly high rate, and which eventually enhanced the difficulties in procuring the men. In point of financial economy, this measure was to be strongly reprobated, as it gave, in the first instance, an extravagantly high premium to men to engage for limited service; and caused, necessarily, to be superadded a large additional bounty to enlist them for general service. He then proceeded to the consideration of the ballot system, which, in the mode it was carried on, he highly censured, particularly its effects upon the agricultural concerns of the country, and the irregularity of its operation, by which one county was oppressed to supply the deficiencies of another. Taking this part of the subject in another point of view, it was equally exceptionable, for, it would be found, that the number of men procured by the ballots for personal service was next to nothing. To illustrate this position, he could not do more than refer to what he deemed an unquestionable authority upon the subject viz. a printed speech of the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, in which, speaking of the numbers procured by the ballots, he estimates the whole at 40,000, out of which, 2000 were obtained for personal service, and the remaining very disproportionate number of 38,000 men were hired substitutes. This consideration alone, the noble lord thought sufficient to overthrow any arguments that might be urged in favour of the Army of Reserve. Adverting to the line of argument adopted by ministers, when ever subjects like the present were discussed, and particular parts of their system pointedly objected to, he observed, their mode of defence was, not to answer or obviate the objections fairly or separately; but, to refer to the aggregate amount of the whole military force, in which care was always taken to include the volunteers. This he deemed a fallacious mode of defence, and not calculated to obviate objections which were too well founded. The merits of the question at issue, even admitting of the correctness of the official documents laid before parliament, were decidedly in favour of his conclusions. By
<image src="S1V0003P0I0412"/>
<col>795</col>
these, he contended, it would appear, that the infantry force, by far the most important, particularly in a disposable line, so far from being augmented, had actually decreased last year; he alluded to the infantry force in G. Britain; this might be seen by a reference to what was stated as the amount of the infantry in Jan. 1804, and what it was by the latest returns of the present year. In referring to these, as well as to some accounts respecting the land forces in an early period of the late war, viz.1794, he observed, that though the aggregate force, including cavalry, and foreign troops, was augmented to an amount exceeding 11,000; yet, as he contended, the British infantry were 800 less. To this was to be added, another consideration, namely, that a comparatively small part of this infantry force was for general service; the amount of those who were enlisted for general service, did not exceed 53,000 men: this was not all, these men, from the terms of their engagements, might be sentout of the country; but under its present circumstances, would it be prudent or safe to send the whole, or any part of that number In fact, could they be spared? certainly not.&#x2014;Proceeding to the consideration of the Additional Force bill, he observed, a sufficient number of men were not raised by it, to supply even the casualties of the army. After dwelling shortly upon this consideration, he observed, that a particular regulation might be introduced, and with the greatest facility, into our military system, which would be attended with the most beneficial consequences; he meant the abolition of the practice of enlisting men into the army for life; for the continuance of such a practice, he thought no argument could possibly be advanced. There was nothing that could make men's minds revolt from entering into the military service of their country, but the idea, that, by so doing, they made a surrender of their personal liberties for life, without the possibility of retracting. Let their lordships look to the system of all the great military powers on the continent, with none of these, the practice of enlisting soldiers for life obtained, but in no country whatever was the abolition of such a practice more loudly called for than in Great Britain; and not a more effectual remedy could be found to prevent desertion, than giving the men an assurance, that at a given time they might have their discharge.
<col>796</col>
Under the present system, the astonishment was not that so few men were procured, but that so many could be obtained. Another great objection to men's freely entering into the army, was the apprehension of their being sent to the West India Islands. On this bead, he should be glad to hear, whether there was any fixed rule for sending out corps by rotation; he was afraid not, but should be happy to learn that he was mistaken. In this part of the subject, another consideration presented itself, which, if well executed, might be carried into effect. He meant a well-regulated plan, for, as well as an extension of, the number of the black corps, for the purpose of colonial service, lie was aware, to a certain degree, of the obstacles which the jealousy of the planters and others in these colonies presented. In fact, the most of these were adverse to seeing the blacks in any other than a state of slavery. Under the present regulations of these corps, they were of very little service; in these, a commission was regarded only as a step towards promotion: at first, commands in these were only given to officers who had served in the West Indies, but that salutary rule was not long followed; however, he was of opinion, that this part of the military force could be rendered of essential service, under proper regulations. Another point was, the extravagantly high rate of living in these quarters, which should in some degree be countenanced, by a certain increase of pay. Judicious means should also be taken to counteract the prevalence of those dangerous maladies which were incidental to those climates. Adverting to the defensive military force of the country, he observed it was not long since deemed to be in that weak and alarming state, as to be the principal cause of a change in the executive administration; and the greatest hopes were entertained of the vigour and efficacy of the measures of the new ministers. These, however, might be classed into two heads; the first, the appointment of an extensive staff of brigadiers; what the aggregate amount of this new expence was, he did not know; but he believed it was taken at 2,5001. for each staff. The second was, the Additional Force bill, the merits of which were recently discussed by their lordships; this measure was so happily framed, that the effects produced by it were perfectly foreign from its professod
<image src="S1V0003P0I0413"/>
<col>797</col>
objects. It was to be regarded rather as a measure of finance, than one of military regulation on this head, his lordship went into some detailed calculation, and particularly dwelt upon the comparatively small number of men which were procured by the parish officers. The measure was, at best, inefficacious; it was, in some parts of its operations, oppressive and unjust; and being hither to productive of no one benefit, though it was in activity for ten months, including those the most favourable for its operation, there existed no reasonable ground to expect it would prove beneficial or serviceable in future, He would detain their lordships no longer, but conclude with moving, "That a committee be appointed to revise the different acts passed in the two last sessions of parliament, for the military defence of the country; and to consider of such farther measures as may be necessary to make that defence more complete and premanent."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01562"><member>Earl Camden</member><membercontribution> observed, that he should proceed upon the discussion of the important subject before their lordships, without making any political or personal allusion whatever; and, it was with regret, that on a debate on a motion brought forward by a noble friend of his, about a fortnight ago, he felt himself under the necessity of making a few observations of that nature. With respect to the question before the house, he doubted not, but their lordships, on a reference to, and a consideration of, what appeared in the official documents upon the table, would make up their minds how it should be decided. With a view to the due illustration of the subject, he had laid on the table several documents, in addition to those moved by the noble baron, who came forward in the present instance, and other noble lords. Some of these respected the artillery, and by the accounts their lordships would see the increase, particularly in that important description of our military force. His lordship then entered into some detailed calculations, drawn from the documents adverted to, and, as one of the results, observed, it would clearly appear, the disposeable force was increased within the year, to an amount exceeding 13,000 men; and this part of the army consisted of corps and troops the best calculated and prepared for foreign or for active service. The noble secretary enforced some of the arguments he had used in the former debate in support of the Additional Force
<col>798</col>
bill, and contended that, from the united operation and effects of the different measures for the regulation of the military system, the army was considerably increased, and in a progressive state of improvement and increase; so that upon the whole, there was every reason to hope for the expected state of amelioration. With respect to discipline and increased numbers, it was therefore evidently unsafe materially to alter or derange that system. From the plans that were now in operation for organizing the force for limited service, the regular army or disposeable force would be materially benefited. From what he had stated, he trusted it would appear to their lordships, that no fewer than 23,000 men had been added to our military force within the year, as well by the ordinary mode of recruiting, as the other means of raising men, which were in a train of operation. He contended, that on the grounds of 28,000 men being raised within so short an interval, the prospect of a far greater and progressive increase, and the certainty of an improved and improving state of discipline and preparation; it was evident no necessity whatever existed for the proceeding called for by the noble lord's motion. Proceeding again to a detached consideration of the subject, he contended, that from the numbers raised already in the course of the present year, there was every right, taking an average calculation, to suppose that 24,000 men, at least, would be raised before the expiration of the year. Let these numbers be compared with the numbers of men raised within the same intervals, would be still more strongly in his facour. The present aggregate military force was within so small a number as 8,000, of what it amounted to in the concluding years of the late war; taking the subject in every possible point of view, the legislature and the government were called upon to persevere in the system already laid down; the more especially, when the situation of the country, with relation to foreign powers, and still more so, with respect to the enemy, was considered and particularly as far as a disposable force was concerned. His lordship spoke shortly in defence of the army of reserve bill, deeming it upon the whole a good measure and through which a number of men were raised; but at the same time admitted its unavoidably injurious tendency, in raising, throughout the medium of compe-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0414"/>
<col>799</col>
tition, the bounties to a very high rate. With respect to the noble baron's calculations, that not a greater number than 53,000 men were obtained for general service, he begged leave to differ from him. By his referring to the documents, he thought it must incontrovertibly appear, than 74,000 men were at least obtained for that service. In reference to the ideas suggested, relative to the black corps, he had to observe, that steps were taken for the amelioration of that part of our colonial force.; and as to the rules by which we next were guided, in selecting troops for the West India station, he had only to remark, that care was taken, that such men were preferably sent out, as were least likely to be injured by those climates. Upon the whole, he trusted, that he had proved, and he hoped the determination of their lordships would evince it, that no adequate reason or ground existed for the appointment of such a committee as was moved for by the noble lord.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01563"><member>Earl Stanhope</member><membercontribution> said, that the notification of the motion now before the house had induced his attendance this night. He thought the motion of his noble friend one of the best in every point of view, that could possibly be devised, in the present circumstances of the country: the motion did his noble friend credit, as well as his mode of treating the subject. The noble secretary who answered, or rather who attempted to answer his noble friend; expressed his hope that the house, would decide against the motion; but his hope, his wish, and his advice to the house were that the motion should be agreed to. From the general terms of the motion, which was, that a committee be appointed to revise the acts that have been passed in the two last sessions, for the defence of the country, it was allowable for him to enter into a discussion of these acts, of one of them at least, he should do so, and he trusted in such a way, although it was considered by his noble friend, in that point of view, as that he should convince their lordships its leading provisions were mischievous, injurious, and absurd. The view taken by his noble friend of the act to which he alluded, was chiefly of a military nature. In what he had laid. down in that view of it, he agreed with his noble friend; but the view he should take of it was a still more important one. The fact of its producing but a very small number of. Men was a disadvantage, but its most objectionable effects lay deeper,
<col>800</col>
and in these views of it the consequences of the measure were truly alarming. Were he to state from memory certain clauses and provisions of the bill to which he alluded, their lordships would regard it to be impossible, that any act of parliament should contain such clauses and provisions. But he had a printed copy of the bill in his pocket, to this he would refer, and if any of their lordships doubted the correctness of his print, they could compare it with the statute upon the table. It was the act for raising and maintaining a permanent additional force, &amp;c. and passed the 29th day of June last. In the 20th section of this act, for he wished regularly to refer their lordships to the chapter and verse which he quoted, the parish officers were entitled to certain sums. In the 24th section, the bounties were not to exceed three-fourths of the money which should from time to time be allowed as bounties, for the infantry for general service. This was done, no doubt, from a conviction that three-fourths of the bounty would be more acceptable than the whole; or it might be done upon a calculation of the difference in value, between men so raised, and those enlisted for general service. By the 33d section, inspectors were to ascertain the deficiencies in the numbers allotted to be raised by the respective parishes, on which justices of the peace were authorised to assess such parishes, in proportion to the deficiencies aforesaid; the 34th clause enacted, that such penalties should be levied, but not paid out of the poor's rates. They were then necessarily to fall upon the farmers; but he wished to know, how these farmers were to be indemnified. How, but by raising the prices of corn and provisions upon the people! The last bill which affected these things directly, he had singly to oppose. Yet, the bill now referred to was fully as mischievous as that; nay, it went something deeper, and to the full, made as effective a part of the famine-mongering system. This was a strong incontrovertible reason for the committee required by the motion, in order that at least such a nuisance, such an engine in the system of starvation, might be done away. It was not only helping to starve the poor, but, through a rise of the price of labour, to raise the price of manufactures, and so injure their sale in foreign markets; from that would spring the ruin of the commerce of the country, thence the ruin of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0415"/>
<col>801</col>
its navy and the shipping interests, and, with these, the ruin of its military defence. The antidotes to these dreadful disorders might be had in the discontinuance of a system which starved and famished the people. Better were it not to tax the farmers at all; for whatever taxes were laid on them, would, in case of all direct taxes on the tallow chandler, the brewer, &amp;c. induce a rise in prices of grain and corn, articles of the first necessity. The rise in these would necessarily beget a rise in the prices of labour; and that by a necessary and mischievous progression would re-act, so as to produce a still further rise in the prices of corn and grain. The effect of the bill was directly to tax the farmer, in addition to all his other, and increasing burdens. It was obvious that the prices of provision had increased, were increasing, and ought to be diminished.&#x2014;As to the military system of the country, though he totally disapproved of. the defence act, yet he wished to see the country well armed. A friend of his out of doors, a person for whom he had a great respect, (major Cartwright) had written well on this subject. Noble lords might laugh, but the noble lord, the secretary of state for the home department, would not laugh when he mentioned another writer on this subject, his own father, who had written a book, when Mr. Jenkinson, on the military defence of the country. This latter book was the most constitutional, legal, learned, scientific, and entertaining tract on the national defence, he had ever perused. Both on the principles of this book, and from his own conviction of the necessity, as well as wisdom, of so doing, he was not only for arming the people, but wished the arming to be more general. But the system of ministers was that of arming the people at present, and starving them afterwards. Besides, there was the utmost reason to apprehend the worst possible consequences from the state of indiscipline in which the force is; though this could not much occasion surprize, when it was recollected that under a noble secretary of state opposite him (lord Camden) the state of indiscipline of Ireland, when he was lord-lieutenant, was such, that general Abercrombie, on arriving in that country, as commander in chief, in 1795, issued a proclamation, stating, among other things, that the army, from its indiscipline, was only formidable to itself, and not to an enemy. The state of our means of de-
<col>802</col>
fence was not so good-as under the late minister. The present minister was perhaps a man of more brilliant talents, but he was not a man of more good sense, than the late. Yet the present minister thought nothing of calling the noble lord (Sidmouth) fool and simpleton; though the truth Was, that the noble lord had more good sense in his little finger than the now chancellor of the exchequer had in his whole body; and that was not saying much. However, the noble lord was got out of office; and then nothing was heard but the cry of the transcendent merits of Mr. Pitt. Round went the friends of the right hon. gent, about every where, and told the people that he would bring in his Defence bill, which was to correct every abuse, remedy every grievance, and meliorate the whole system of our military force. But, lo! the mountain was in labour, and brought forth this brat of a Defence bill, now in every body's hand. That noisy labour had brought forth only such a rickety subject as would have been disavowed by any one less subject to shame than his majesty's present chancellor of the exchequer! One material objection he had to our military system as it now subsists, was, that we recruited our men for life. To remedy this single grievance, it was incumbent on the house to agree to the motion for a committee, which had been submitted by his noble friend. The book of lieut. col. Wilson on. this subject, was worthy the perusal of their lordships. As a military enquiry, this book, his lordship thought, possessed incomparable merit. But it was in the power of their lordships to devise arguments superior to what could occur to common minds; thus, books by individuals could only be helps to them. Such were, however, good helps. Under all the circumstances of the times, and knowing that there never was a worse bill than the De-fence bill, he would most heartily vote for the motion of his noble friend. The de-fence act ought in all events to be repealed, for it was an act founded on wickedness, and that wickedness founded on fraud.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01564"><member>The earl of Romney</member><membercontribution> began, by expressing his surprize at the whole of what had been said by the noble earl who had just sat down, and most particularly so in what he had said as to his noble friend opposite (lord Camden) having brought the army into a state of indiscipline at the time he was lord lieutenant of Ireland. So far from that being the case, said the noble
<image src="S1V0003P0I0416"/>
<col>803</col>
lord, I verily believe that, it is to the. excellent measures and strenuous exertions of that noble earl, that we owe the. safety of Ireland, and without which that part of the empire would have been lost to this. So far from injuring the discipline of the army, his noble friend had put. arms into the hands of a large body of men, zealously attached to the cause of their king and country, whose loyalty then impelled them, to offer their services to combat insurrection and rebellion within, as well as the enemies without the country, and which men had been brought to as high a state of discipline as those of any army in the world. But there was one part of the speech of the noble lord who spoke last that was most, extraordinary indeed: he said that house had first dared to put arms into, the hands of the people, and then, afterwards, had dared to attempt their starvation. Good God! What had they done? When he heard the words, his hair stood on end! The noble earl imputes that to their lordships which was altogether the act of Providence, viz. a bad crop, the effects of which he knew and lamented as much as any one. Their lordships could not controul the seasons, nor make the corn grow in spite of their opposition; had we obtained a fair crop, he was certain there would have been no occasion for discontent: that, under, the guidance of Providence, was the sole cause of the high prices which had taken place in the necessaries of life, and it was not fair to impute them to any act of the legislature.&#x2014;His lordship begged pardon for this digression, into which he bad naturally been led by the observations of the noble earl, and then proceeded to advert to the bill in question in this debate. He allowed that it had not fully answered the intentions for which it was framed: but he attributed this, in a considerable degree, to have happened from the bill not having as yet had a fair trial. He knew, however, from pretty good authority, that it was the intention of the right hon. gent. who framed it, to make many material alterations in it; and he had no doubt that by these means it might be made productive of great and important advantages to the service and defence of the country; and, in matters of this kind, he should wish such alterations as might be necessary to come from that quarter. His lordship said, he never was nor ever would be, the tool of any administration; but he would never do any thing which might tend to distress them at
<col>804</col>
such times, especially as the circumstances of the country required for them support. The noble earl who spoke last had stated that the people were distressed and discontented, and our manufactures on the decline, and the manufacturers unemployed. He was happy to say, he had every reason to believe the very reverse to be the truth of the fact; that our manufactures were in the most prosperous and flourishing state, the people perfectly contented and happy in the pleasing contemplation that their situation abounded with the greatest blessings, when they compared it with that of every other nation in Europe; and from the confidence they reposed in the present government, he. believed they were unanimous in their zeal and enthusiasm for the defence of the country, and of the blessings they enjoyed under our invaluable, constitution. His lordship then adverted to the volunteers, to whose exertions and ardour he gave great praise, and particularly to those of his county, which, he declared, were as well disciplined as any, army in the world need to be. He was sorry, he said, to have detained their lordships so long, but he had been led on to say more than he intended, from a wish to throw a proper degree of light on the gloomy picture which the noble earl who spoke last had drawn of the state and situation of the country. His lordship concluded by saying, that the present motion should have his hearty dissent.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01565"><member>The Earl of Carlisle</member><membercontribution> said, that if enquiry was so necessary last year as had been held to be by certain noble lords on the opposite side of the house, he was at a loss to find out why it was not equally so at present. Those noble lords were last year the most strenuous and vehement for an enquiry into the state of the military defence of the country, because they then said the measures pursued, and pursuing by the then administration, were weak, inefficient, and. inadequate to the purpose: every abuse was thrown on the folly, incapacity, and imbecility of those who brought forward those measures; and a noble viscount.(Sid-mouth) now in this house, but who was then at the head of his majesty's administration in the other house, was driven from his place on account of the imbecility of those measures. The noble earl then adverted to what these measures were, which were then called so inadequate, and said, the last of them was the noble viscount's Army of Reserve bill the reason
<image src="S1V0003P0I0417"/>
<col>805</col>
given for the violent abuse of which Was that it produced only a few men; but now comes this poor, wretched, contemptible parish bill, which turned parish-officers into recruiting serjeants, and yet produced fewer men, but is now called a better bill, and all enquiry into it was said to be minecessary. The noble earl supposed the noble lords would carry the argument up to its utmost climax, and contend that a bill that raised no men at all would be the best of all possible bills. The praise demanded by ministers seemed to be in an inverse proportion to their success. It reminded him of the line in one of Dryden's tragedies, where a lover exclaimed;
<quote>"My wound is great because it is so small."</quote>
on which a wit who was present cried out,
<quote>"Then twould be greater, were it none at all."</quote>
In answer to the argument of the noble earl who spoke last, that the bill had not had a fair trial, his lordship observed, that it had been passed as a bill that was to have a speedy and forcible effect; that was to produce men in great numbers, and in &amp; short time; and yet, after Several months, it is alleged that it has not had a fair trial. Whey was it ever brought forward? Why was it ever acted on? It was to supersede measures which had raised a great many men in a very little time, but which were pretended by the framer of this bill to be inefficient and imbecile, yet it turned out to be a more weak and ricketty brat than any of them. Noble lords would recollect, that when the present minister pulled the stool of power from under the noble viscount who was then the minister, he raised an alarm that the enemy was at our very doors, and we were offering up our prayers to Heaven that we might not be swallowed up by Bonaparte. He assured parliament and the country, that he would produce a plan by which the army would be immediately recruited, and relying on which, the country would be safe at home, and would be enabled to carry destruction into the country of the enemy. Fortunately the enemy had not yet come, but now parliament was told by ministers that it must wait some time longer, in order to give their measure a fair trial.&#x2014;The noble earl insisted that the bill had not succeeded in the object for which it was framed, and that it was absurd to say, that in three or four years it might succeed. If a crop were wanted immediately from a piece of land, it would be just as absurd to sow a grain Which required to lie several months in the
<col>806</col>
ground before ft triage its appearance on the surface.? Perhaps the conduct of Frederic tire Great w Prussia might be instanced by government as a defence of their tardy method of increasing the force of their country. When that military monarch saw any woman remarkable for her height and muscular appearance, he immediately caused her to be married to a grenadier of his body guard, and by this means hoped to produce an Herculean breed from which his army might ultimately be recruited. The progress of the operation of the additional defence act was scarcely less deliberate, and indeed the whale measure deserved nothing but ridicule and contempt. His lordship contended further, that the committee now moved for by his noble friend would embrace many points more than that as to the number of men which had been raised under this bill, and deprecated the hackneyed and antiquated argument of ministers not being pressed in time of war, as that to which their lordships ought not to lend ah ear. He said such a committee would very properly inquire into the propriety of what had been suggested as to enlisting men for a limited time of service, which had been highly recommended by many excellent writers on military affairs, as particularly relating to our own service: the militia and volunteer system might also come under their revision; and though he had the highest opinion of both the militia and volunteers, there were, no doubt, many improvements which yet might be made in, both those systems. He thought inquiry was full as necessary now as it was last year, and he expected an answer from that strong phalanx of ministers who sat opposite to him, which should, at least, contain some reason why inquiry was so necessary and so loudly called for in the case of the weak and imbecile measure of the noble lord (Sidmouth), and so very unnecessary in that of the present bill; which was far the weakest and most imbecile of any that had yet been produced On these grounds he should vote for the motion of his noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01566"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> said he rose at this early period to address their lordships, and to call their attention to the nature, of the, motion now before them, on the ground on which it had been supported, and which, he trusted, would induce them to come to a decided negative for without saying it was a motion out of the province of a house of parliament to entertain, it was one which, on
<image src="S1V0003P0I0418"/>
<col>807</col>
general principles he should have strong objections to, because its tendency was to devolve the military administration of the country on a committee of their lordships, lie could see nothing that could support such a motion but that constitutional ground of want of confidence of that house in the administration of the day, and the fair way of stating it was to call for evidence of facts, to ascertain what the state of the army was at this moment, and it that army was inadequate, and the exertions of ministers had been insufficient for the purposes of our protection, that should be stated as a ground for an address to his majesty to remove his ministers. On that point some difference of opinion might be entertained, perhaps, among those who opposed them; however that might be, it was clearly the object of all motions of this kind, to censure, if not to remove ministers, and in that way he had no difficulty in meeting the motion at once, and to say that no ground existed for such a motion.&#x2014;Having stated this as his opinion on the tendency of such motions as these, he should proceed to observe on the present one, which brought before the house this question, namely, what was the present military situation of this country? And upon that subject he was ready to enter into a full discussion. He was ready to enter into a comparison of the military situation of this country at the present moment, and that of any former period, and of any other country; and to discuss the point also, whether ministers had done all that could be done in that respect. The first question, then, was upon the general amount of our force, and here he must take the liberty of observing, that any stranger who had heard the noble lords who complained to-night of our military system, would be induced to think that we bad, at this moment, a smaller, a less efficient, and worse disciplined army than formerly; now, if the fact was the reverse, if we had now a larger and a better disciplined army than at any former period, he would venture to ask, what ground there was for instituting the extraordinary measure proposed by this motion, in order that noble lords might take the administration of the military affairs of this country into their own hands. Now with respect to our force, he was ready to contend it was not only greater than it had been in any former period in this country, but greater than the military of any other country in comparison to its
<col>808</col>
population; greater in that respect even than France, possessing for military purposes advantages over others by its revolutionary system, as indeed many others did over a country like ours, where every body was free, and would not be compelled to take upon him the military force of this country, exclusive of the volunteer force, of men who were taken away entirely from productive labour, and accumulating industry, in civil life and purely military in this country at this moment, could not be estimated much below 400,000 in the united kingdom exclusive he must repeat it, of the volunteer force, and which he should presently state. The military force of this country, including officers, was 390,000 men that was to say men who were withdrawn entirely from the civil employment of life and productive labour, and whose pursuits were purely military; this taken from a population, of 15 millions, which, on a calculation, he believed, would produce one&#x2014;fourth capable of bearing arms, that was,3,800,000 of male adults, and this would make actually one-tenth of the whole of the male population of the United Kingdom. Now, to compare this with the situation of other countries, we should see how much our military force was superior in that respect to any other in Europe, although many of these had much greater advantages for producing a military force than we had, although inferior certainly to us in every other respect. The military force of France was not move than 362,000 army, out of a population of 32 millions, the fourth of which, being the male population capable of bearing arms would be 8 millions, and then their army would amount only to the proportion of I out of 14 of the male population capable of bearing arms. If we looked to Russia, its army might be stated at 590,000 men, and its population was 34 millions. The proportion of men capable of bearing arms was 8,500,00, and this would make only 1 out of 14 in the whole male population of that country. Austria had an army of 370,000. Its population was 20 millions. The proportion capable of bearing arms was consequently 5,000,000 and this would be one out of between 13 and 14 of the whole male population capable of bearing arms. The only power in Europe which approached this country as to its military force in comparison to its population, was Prussia. It had a population of 9 millions,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0419"/>
<col>809</col>
and an army of 250,000 men, which yielded a proportion similar to that of this country, that of one in ten; but Prussia was not like any other power in Europe in respect to her army, for her army was more composed of foreigners than that of any other power. The result of the whole of this calculation was this, that France, Austria, and Prussia, had an army of 1 out of 13 or 14 out of the whole male population capable of bearing arms, except Prussia, which had a great number of foreigners in her force, and this country, in which the army bore a proportion capable of bearing arms. All this with regard to Great Britain, was exclusive of its volunteer force, which was, indeed, a double character, and of incalculable value to the state, for they were men, who besides being efficient in military view, connected in civil life with civil occupations and productive labour, and accumulating industry. Their number was 380,000, which with sea fencibles, to the number of 30,000, made the whole number of men in arms,in the United kingdom, s10,000. That was not 1 in 14, as other countries have, nor 1 in 10, but nearly 1 in 4, of the whole male population of this country capable of bearing arms; a greater proportion than this country ever had before; greater than any other country on the globe has now; greater than France herself ever had with all her facility of producing military force under her revolutionary system, even at its height, under the terror of Robespierre; and all this military force in this country was not growing, as in others it did, out of the distress, the confusion, or the ruin of the country, but out of a system of order, discipline, and riches, such as gave us all security, and not only enabled us to bid defiance to all the attempts or the threats of our enemy, but at the same time stamped sentiment, loyalty, and zeal of the people. Looking, then, at this state of our force, unparalleled as it was in extent, and equal to every purpose for which a force could be desirable, he would ask, was there any ground for saying that the house ought to doubt the efficiency of the executive government, and that its power ought to be delegated to a committee of a house of parliament?&#x2014;He had hitherto considered the question, with reference to the quantity of our force; and he should begin
<col>810</col>
with that force, which Was in its nature, the most loose, although a very important force under all circumstances, in this country: he meant our volunteer force. He knew that force had been said to have undergone considerable diminution in the course of the last year; but he was prepared to contradict that fact. Indeed if it had undergone some considerable decrease, it would not have disappointed his expectation, but even then he should have said, that the quality of what remained would have made up for the disadvantage of the diminution of numbers. There were two points to be considered in this case; the nominal establishment, and the effective number. That number, officers included, in Great Britain, was 380,000 men. Rank and file they were 342,000 men. He could not give the actual number of those who had been inspected, which was above the 310,000, a large proportion of the whole, and who were actually forthcoming, and fit for immediate service, he believe, from the last return was 307,000, making in all a diminution of no more than 3,000 men out of that immense force; and with respect to the quality of the Volunteer force, he was likewise prepared to state, that from the reports of the officers who had inspected them, and paid the utmost attention to their discipline, a vast mass was reported to be fit for any service, and out of the whole number of 307,000, no more than 22,000 were reported to be deficient in discipline; 210,000 had been on permanent duty, had been subject to the military laws, and to the rigour of military discipline, and to feel what the duties of a soldier were. Upon the efficiency of. such a force, it was unnecessary for him to dwell. Such a mass of men having had experience of a military life, who had submitted to their duty with willingness, readiness, arid zeal, was a force from which we had a right to augur every thing that was advantageous to the country, if they should ever be called into action. He thought it necessary to state thus much on the Volunteer force, to shew it was greater than any other country ever had at any former period, and that it was in discipline so considerably improved, that it exceeded even the hopes of any body at the first institution of that body. He came now to the Regular Army, and he was ready to meet the noble lords, who charged ministers with avoiding specific information, upon that subject, He knew it was the duty of ministers to be
<image src="S1V0003P0I0420"/>
<col>811</col>
explicit upon that, and upon every other subject on which they possessed information. He should state, therefore, what force we had that was disposable, and what force was limited; and, in no period during the present or the late administration, had ministers attempted to blink that question, they had never declined stating the amount of the army. The army, exclusive of our militia, which by the way was, not only in, quantity, but also in quality, much improved, and every officer in the service would admit that the militia of this country was never at any former period fit to be compared with that body at the present moment in point of discipline, and here he was speaking upon the best authority. Now, what was our army, exclusive of the militia, in all parts of the world? It amounted to 162,000. An army more considerable than we ever bad, before; and, in quality, he would undertake to say, much superior to most of our former force, for it was not composed, as had been customary, with a very large proportion of new levies, but; the greater number of them were inured to the service in battalion, more than ever was the case at any former period in the history of the forces of this country. Of this army, 80,000 were in the plantations, and in the colonies about 56,000, which was the whole of our foreign service at present, except the German Legion; and in G. Britain and Ireland there was a disposable force of about 80,000; but he was perfectly ready to admit that the Whole of that force was not disposable. He observed that the whole of this force could not be sent abroad, for that, besides militia, there must be a certain number of the regular force kept in this country, instead of depending upon the militia; but this was a matter dependent upon circumstances, for if any great attack were made upon the enemy on the continent, that would be a diversion of the power of the enemy, and render his attempt at a descent upon Us the less probable; and in proportion to that, our regular force at home would become disposable which was at present not so; and here he must be allowed to repeat, that estimating the Character of the army of this country at former periods as highly as any noble lord pleased, still be was ready to maintain, that we had a larger and a better disposable army at this moment than this country ever had at any former period whatever. He would admit, however, that
<col>812</col>
taking the whole of our force together, our limited force was too great, and our unlimited force too little, but that to make a larger, portion disposable would not leave us without sufficient defence; all he wanted to impress, upon their lordships in, this case was that we had now a larger and a better disposable force than we ever had at any former period. But it had been stated there was a great deficiency in our establishment, and the ground was, that there was a deficiency in some of the regiments, and therefore, it was argued, there was a deficiency in our force; this was a fallacious mode of reasoning; because we had a greater number of regiments than were necessary with reference to the whole number of men we wanted; but the only successful way to raise them, was to have them spread as widely as possible, and hence arose the number of regiments, and although some of them were incomplete, it by no means from thence followed that the establishment was deficient; and this distinction was lost sight of when noble lords declaimed against government for having an army on paper only; but the question was not whether we had hot some regiments which were defective, but what was the real amount of our establishment, and this was to be judged of by circumstances, and a reference was to be had to the force of the, enemy likely to operate against us. Why then, if he had clearly established the facts, that we had a larger military establishment of every description than any other country upon earth; a larger army much in proportion to our population, than our enemy had he would ask, what was the ground for calling on that house to institute an investigation which would be productive of no advantage, but which might produce great evils, at all events great hazard, for it would introduce any project with any individual might chuse to propose. A course of proceeding, which he; Would take leave to remind their lordships, was always reprobated by the best informed persons, as a dangerous practice in parliament. He knew that the army was under the superintending care of parliament, as well as every other branch of the executive government in that respect; yet their lordships would recollect historically, not only that the most enlightened statesmen had from time to report bated the practice of the houses of parliament unnecessarily interfering with the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0421"/>
<col>813</col>
conduct of the executive government, but also that their very journals stated much jealousy of the houses of parliament taking into their hands the business of, executive government; and it had been emphatically said that the sword should never be in any hand but that of his majesty. He would conceive, however, that some specific measures might be proposed, on the emergency of an occasion, and that any noble lord might propose them; and although he should have many objections to any thing of that kind coming from any hands but those of the Executive government, especially if it were a proposition relative to the military establishment of the country, not in point of parliamentary form, for that he knew to be regular, but in point of expediency, which required that every thing of that kind should originate with executive government; still if ministers had neglected to do what ought to be done, the more regular and the safer way would be to move an address to his majesty to remove them. If, however, any noble lord thought that there was any material deficiency, in the conduct of his majesty's ministers, and yet did, not chuse to move that they should be removed, he might move upon it, but then he should make a distinct specific proposition, so that the house might at least; know, the extent of the evil; but this was so general that nobody could see the extent to which it might lead. His lordship then proceeded to defend the additional force bill. He denied, therefore, that this act had been, as was said of it, ineffectual. It had, on the contrary, been very considerably effective, and would be more so, if allowed to proceed. The ordinary recruiting had been increased by it, which had before been very much impaired. The army of reserve bill had raised a greater number of men in a short time, but had been found, to be attended with many inconveniencies, amongst which was that material and important one of raising the bounties. These incoveniencies all fell directly in the way of the success of the present bill at its first outset. To judge fairly of its probable success, they should look at its. operation for the last three months, and they would then be better able to judge what it was likely to do in future. His lordship agreed in opinion with the noble baron who brought forward the motion, as to the general scope of his arugument respecting the black corps; but
<col>814</col>
the noble baron must recollect that, notwithstanding such a sort of force might be the best for the defence of such a country in such a climate, yet it was of that kind which particularly required that limitation should be attended to; for it would be always necessary to proportion it to the number of white inhabitants, as well as to the number of white troops employed in the defence of the islands&#x2014;His lordship next adverted to the subject of enlisting men for limited service, which had been so much praised, and which might possibly deserve much of the encomium that was paid to it. For his own part, he had given it every attention and consideration in his power, he found it of such high importance, that he would have made himself master of it, if he could; but he found among those who were best informed on the subject whom he had consulted, so much doubt as to its success, that though there might be an appearance of advantage in many points of view, there were so many of a, contrary, tendency which presented themselves, at the same time, that he thought it would be better and safer to adhere to the mode which our excellent constitution had pointed out. His lordship declared himself averse to the system of innovation, which this motion was calculated to produce, and thought it wise to abide by that system which we knew, and of which we had felt the happy effect, by which the British army had been the glory of its country the terror of its foes, and the admiration of the world. He had gone through all the different statements of the noble lords who supported, the motion; he had endeavoured to prove there was no power equal to us upon earth in force, and that the discipline of that force was better than at any former period; he had proved that there was no specific ground for this motion, and that if any noble lord thought, his majesty's ministers had neglected their duty, the regular way was to move an address to his majesty to remove them. He had nothing more to do than, to take notice of the allusion made to what he had said on a former occasion, of the probability being diminished of the enemy making an attempt to attack us by descent; it was true he had said so, but to what was it owing? To a conviction that it would be the ruin and destruction of those who should attempt it. This was the result of the zeal and spirit of the people of this
<image src="S1V0003P0I0422"/>
<col>815</col>
country, from She commencement of the present war to the present hour, wherein they had shewn themselves greater than ever they appeared in any former period of its history. This was known; this was felt in every part of the world; the effects of which, he was convinced, would prove not only beneficial to us and advantageous to our security, but of permanent advantage, and finally conducive to the security of every country in the world.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01567"><member>Earl Darnley</member><membercontribution> rose, in support of the motion. His lordship gave his ample assent and approbation to what the noble secretary had observed respecting the zeal and energy with which all ranks had Stepped forward in opposition to the designs of the common enemy; but he objected very much to the arguments which had been used against the motion, and which were precisely the same with which the late administration had, in the last session, combatted their opponents upon bills of a similar tendency to the presents He thought the opposition of the noble secretary too general; deprecated that part of it relating to the time of service, for which the troops were to be considered as engaged, and which his lordship stated required great alterations; and, though he professed the greatest conviction of the noble secretary's abilities for the conduct of the war department, his lordship differed from him materially with respect to the efficiency of the reasons adduced in defence of the bill, and which in his opinion seemed to have no tendency towards the grand end of a speedy termination of the war. His lordship went on to shew, that the military state of the country was not adequate to what was required by the exigencies of the occasion, such as his majesty's ministers themselves described them, nor to the resources and spirit of the country, if properly called forth and directed. With respect to the talents, and capacity, and character of his majesty's ministers, he thought it fair, and just, and parliamentary to consider them, when any of their measures were under consideration, and to introduce the discussions of these measures when the inefficiency of them afforded proof of the incapacity of their authors. Here the noble lord entered into an examination of the amount of the change that had taken place in the govt. The noble and learned lord on the woolsack was still the same, nor did he wish to see any change take place wit, respect to him, The lord
<col>816</col>
Privy Seal had the same weight and the same talents which he had in the last and in the preceding administration, and which he may hold in many succeeding ones. His noble friend opposite (lord Hawkesbury) had been put but of a situation for which he had at first been declared eminently qualified, and was replaced by his other noble friend (lord Mulgrave), whose military abilities he respected, but who could not by military talents and military experience, be qualified for a place so little connected with military objects: was there the same weight of character and respectability in the right hon. gent, at the head of the govt.? well, indeed, it might be said of that right hon. gent. quantum mutates ab illo! How much had he suffered by taking to his bosom the noble lord opposite, whom he had driven from the govt. as incapable! The noble lord at the head of the Admiralty was another example of the distribution of office without regard to experience. What the noble lord might do remained yet to be ascertained His first effort, the catamaran expedition, did not promise much, and his capacity for the office could not be compared with the noble lord who had left it. He would readily conform to the noble lord's (Hawkesbury)idea, of moving directly for the dismissal of his majesty's ministers, if he thought the motion would be attended with any success.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01568"><member>The Earl of Suffolk</member><membercontribution> took a retrospect of the manner in which the militia had been recruited, the Army of Reserve raised, and the general effects of the Defence Act, considering it as an object of reproach not only to his majesty's ministers, but to their lordships, that they should persevere in a measure, which must, from concomitant circumstances; progressively decrease the raising of a disposable force, most particularly at this season of the year when the time of harvest was approaching, and so many persons were engaged in agriculture. His lordship then adverted to the statement of the noble secretary of state, specifying the number of regular regiments, militia, &amp;c. and made some general observations adverse to the mode of raising and using black regiments for the service of the West India Islands.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01569"><member>The Duke of Montrose</member><membercontribution> in answer observed, that the black regiments during the last war had displayed most evident marks of their fidelity and courage in repelling the Spaniards who had attacked that part

<col>817</col>
of our settlements. When these troops were well treated, his majesty might depend upon their faithful services; and he I was well satisfied, it was worthy the serious discussion of parliament to enquire into the state of these people, and ameliorate their condition as much as possible, His lordship insisted that the bill in question was a most effectual one for the purposes intended, and would prove much I more so, when it was understood throughout the kingdom to be the determination of parliament to persist in it. The reason it had not been so productive hitherto was, I because the raising the militia and Army of Reserve had drained the country for a time; but, after a year or two, it would be found most productive indeed. The object of the question then before their lordships was, not which was the best means of discussing a military question; it was not a motion for considering and enquiring into the state of the military? force of the country; but it was a motion for an address to his majesty, to remove his present ministers: upon this, however, he observed, that were certain persons to be admitted to his majesty's councils today, they would not remain in that situation for three mouths.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01570"><member>The Earl of Carisfort</member><membercontribution> did not by any means consider the motion of his noble friend in that point of view; it was a motion replete with wisdom, and well deserving their lordships consideration. The noble secretary of state set out with a pompous enumeration of the number of forces raised for the protection of the country and annoyance of the enemy, and of their state of discipline. The most ample means had been put into the hands of his majesty's ministers by the votes of both houses of parliament; but, with all these advantages, he would ask, what had been effected? Was it a situation for G. Britain to be in, after two years war, after having been menaced during the whole of that time with invasion, and with 800,000 men in arms, not to be able to retort those threats upon the enemy? he was at a loss to know the drift of the noble secretary of state's argument, when he talked of such a number of men in arms. What he wanted to be informed of, what he wished to be assured of, was that we had the means of maintaining a successful war against the enemy. That we had not only a sufficient force for the defence of the country, but a regular disposeable force to annoy the ene-
<col>818</col>
my on his own shores, and to retaliate that menace of invasion, not by words alone, but by actions. With respect to the volunteer force, it was returned as 300,000 effective men; it was not his intention, who was nine or ten years himself a volunteer, to depreciate that measure, he considered it a most efficient and excellent measure in the hands of a wise administration. This most respectable force was raised and organized the last war, upon the renewal of hostilities; they only waited for some constitutional call to come forward to a man, to give confidence to the govt. and to deter the enemy. What measures were then resorted to? nothing was left to voluntary exertions: the gentlemen of the country were called upon to head their neighbours and tenants, and to animate them by their example; but no sooner was this effected, than new methods were resorted to, to cool their ardour and damp their spirit. Inspecting officers were put over them, the strongest proof of the mistrust of govt. of those very persons on whom they affected to depend; but, notwithstanding all this, they continued with unabated zeal to protect their country. With respect to the regular army, which he considered the most important part of the service, his great object was, that we might retort upon the enemy, and assert the dignity of the British nation, which could only be done by a regular, numerous, and disposable force. It was stated, that this force amounted to eighty thousand men, for which number he would give full credit, however a considerable deduction should be made for the army raised for a limited service; taking, therefore, the regular army, artillery, &amp;. what would be the whole amount out of 80,000? not more than 40,000, he contended, would be found effectual. Was this number meant to strike terror into the enemy? What, then, was to be said of his majesty's ministers, at the head of upwards of 16 million of people, amongst whom the greatest emulation prevailed against a particular enemy, after three years war, only procuring a disposeable force of 40,000 men? Surely those ministers did not deserve any praise for this: on the contrary, they merited most decided disapprobation. He therefore conceived, upon the most scrutinous review of the subject, that there must be a radical defect in the mode of raising men. The measures pursued were commenced with raisins the militia, and
<image src="S1V0003P0I0424"/>
<col>819</col>
then balloting for the army of reserve; it becoming necessary to recruit the regular army, a considerable deficiency took place in those forces, so that those measures were uniformly destructive of the intended purposes; and this nation, the greatest in Europe, or in the page of history, left without the means of annoying her enemy, instead of contending successfully against France. His lordship did not feel that they should be justified in wasting the treasure of the country, and spilling the blood of his majesty's subjects, in a war so destructive, without making Some effort to put down the pride and ambition of the enemy. The noble secretary of state had said, we now had a greater force than ever we had. Whatever the establishment might be, it ought at least to be commensurate to the danger. We were not to inquire the number of the forces, but the effect of them. It was also said, that the army of reserve was now as high as ever it was; his majesty's ministers had endeavoured to provide for recruiting that force which proved insufficient: must it not then be said, that all which could be done had been done, and after a trial for so long a time, without effect, could the absolute necessity of parliament to investigate the matter be denied? To what sentiment constitutionally or politically, could the opposition of his majesty's ministers be ascribed? In conclusion, his lordship again called the attention of the house to the one great consideration, that of having a numerous regular and disposeable force. Our situation with regard to the enemy, if no longer dangerous, would be not disgraceful; but, after all the exertions which were made, after all the forces which could be collected, we were still open to the same danger, the same disgrace, and parliament could no longer refrain from interfering.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01571"><member>The Earl of Westmoreland</member><membercontribution> wished the noble lords on the other side to look back to their own conduct and their own measures before they condemned the present administration for pursuing and improving what they had instituted. The noble lords opposite were entitled to the gratitude of the nation for having instituted these measures, and he was only, astonished that they could disapprove of the continuation and improvement of them by the present and ministration. The military state of the country was amply sufficient to justify his majesty's government, and to hold out the most satisfactory expectations to the

He wished, however, that the noble lord, in pity, not to those on that side, but to those whom he wished to defend, bad looked to his right hand and his left before he ventured to charge him and his noble friends with inconsistency, in not supporting the measures the present government had brought forward. he did not mean to charge inconsistency upon his noble friend opposite, who voted for a motion similar to this last year, and who would vote against it this year. He thought that any man who saw reason to think the military state of the country greatly improved, acted an honest and conscientious part in giving his vote accordingly; but for himself, who saw not the smallest reason for changing his former opinion on this subject, lie thought it but reasonable and fair to claim credit at least for consistency, when he thought that if ever necessary, it was tenfold necessary now. But before he proceeded to that part of what he intended to offer to their lordships, he should observe upon the language that had fallen from the noble secretary of state opposite, that it was not fit that any proposition relative to the military state of the country should be originated in parliament, but by the executive government; Gould it be heard without astonishment, in the parlia-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0425"/>
<col>821</col>
ment of the United Kingdom of G. Britain and Ireland, that that parliament, which regulated and controuled by its acts the amount, the description, and the discipline of the whole armed force of the empire, and which, for the purpose of having that controul more complete, voted all the military acts only from year to year&#x2014;was: it to be heard without astonishment and indignation, that that parliament, or any member of it, bad no right to interfere with its own military acts! that it was to be converted into a mere elective assembly, to sanction or reject by its vote whatever ministers the crown may appoint, and whatever measures those ministers may propose! Such language had for the first time within his parliamentary experience, and he believed within the records of parliament, been uttered this night by a secretary of state, and he was sorry to say, as yet without any mark of the disapprobation of their lordships. In looking back to the proceedings of last year, when a motion precisely similar to that made this night was supported by all that was eminent in rank, talents, and property, in the country, united in what the noble lord opposite was pleased to call a faction, it was but natural to ask, what had been done since to convince any one, except, those who were then of that faction, but now members of the present able administration, that a similar enquiry was not deemed necessary now? Much as he had heard this night with sorrow, there was one thing that he had heard with infinite satisfaction. It was the avowal that the act of last year, the repeal of which had been moved by a noble friend of his, should be altered. He for one would most gladly support any alteration that might be proposed, for it was impossible that any alteration could have any effect but to amend it, though no alteration would be complete but that of a total repeal. He was sure the noble lords opposite saw the necessity of the repeal, for if they did not repeal it, it would repeal itself by falling to a mere nullity. It was, indeed, impossible the act could be enforced by the levy of the penalties. The act gave powers to the parish officers and the penalties were to fall on the parishes, which had no controul over the parish officers to compel them to do their duty. He was sure no court of law in England would compel a man to pay a fine incorred by no delinquency of his own not by any default which it was not
<col>822</col>
in his power to prevent or controul. He was sure, that if any court of law could be found to authorize such an injustice against the whole people of England, it would be impossible to enforce the decision. In proceeding, however, to the alteration proposed, it was singular that their lordships would have to take the very same step which was now refused because it came from that side of the house. They should go into a committee, in which the whole military state of the country was to be considered. The measure had been proposed at a period when we were told to count not weeks or days, but hours, in expectation of the danger of invasion. It was brought forward as a means of immediately raising a considerable force; yet, after all the predictions that had been, made, and the expectations that had been formed of its success, the result was almost too trifling to be mentioned. Supposing, which he much doubted, that it had raised 2,500 men, was that a number of which a great nation like this could boast, when it was considered how much had been vaunted of the act before it was put in force? The noble secretary of state, in the very extraordinary and delusive statement that he had this evening made, of what he termed the military force of the country, instead of shewing distinctly the situation in which it stood, had wrapped the seamen, the volunteers, &amp; round the real military force, for the purpose, no doubt, of disguising it as much as possible. The object of the Additional Defence act was not to increase our whole military strength, but to raise a large and immediate disposable force. With all the claims which administration had made to the gratitude of the country for their exertions, if the house would look to the returns of the British infantry, they would rind, that in the last year, instead of having increased, it had decreased. On the 1st of Jan. 1804, the number was 105,886; on the 1st Jan. 1805, it only amounted to 105,033, making a decrease of 853 men in the year. After deducting garrisons, &amp; there remained British infantry for general field service 78,195; but an allowance must be made for casualties that had taken place abroad, and of which no mention was made in the returns on the table. In the East Indies, where such bloody, though glorious, battles had been fought, and in the West Indies, where a malignant distemper prevailed, be could not calculate these casual
<image src="S1V0003P0I0426"/>
<col>823</col>
ties at less than 4,000, reducing the whole number to 74,19. The apportionment of v these troops would be, abroad 31,113, at c home 43,082. But the house should recollect, that our establishments in different t pans of the world must be maintained, c and this, on a moderate computation, would require thirteen thousand men, which I would leave the British infantry in this I country about 30,000 men. The only chance we had of re-establishing G. Britain in the rank which she held in Europe, before the peace of Amiens, was by a. cooperation with the continental powers; but to make this co-operation effectual, we must not be satisfied with granting pecuniary succours; how were we qualified to afford any other? We had but the paltry disposable force of 30,000 men; nor could we send even those to the continent, unless we determined to leave G. Britain with no other defence than the militia and Volunteers, and Ireland with no defence but the militia alone. The noble lord commented severely on the array of reserve act which he termed a wretched measure. It had been imagined by some, that if the defence act were repealed, recourse must be had again to the army of reserve act; but of this there was no danger. He recommended strongly the recruiting for limited service, and concluded by declaring his hearty assent to the motion of his noble friend.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01573"><member>Lord Mulgrace</member><membercontribution> defended the noble lord? (Hawkesbury) from the charge of having said that parliament had no right to discuss military questions. His noble friend, who had arraigned this position with so much asperity, had totally misrepresented his noble friend, who said merely that parliament ought not to originate and devise military plans, unless in cases of the utmost necessity; such as did not now exist. He denied that any such motion as the present had been adopted last year for no such motion had even been debated. For his own part, though he had concurred in thinking that some change in administration was necessary, he by no mean ever went so far as to think that all tin military plans of the late ministry should be repealed. Of the army of reserve ac bethought that it had been of essential service to the public, and that it was suspended, not because it was bad but be cause it was no longer necessary. H contended that the measure so much arrangued had not received sufficient trial and that what trial had taken place encou-
<col>824</col>
raged a belief, that it would produce men without impeding the other means of recruiting the army, But neither that, nor any other plan, could be effectual, unless pursued with constancy; nor if it was thwarted by conflicting measures, and, enfeebled by doubts and uncertainty, as to its continuance. As then there was no necessity for entering upon a course of inquiry which was likely to obstruct, rather than promote the public safety, as the state of the national defence was such as to afford us a well grounded confidence of success, should it be called into action, he was decidedly hostile to the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01574"><member>The Lord Chancellor</member><membercontribution> defended the military system of the late administration, lie stated the motion, and contended that the latter part of it, which proposed that the house should, alter revising the existing laws on the subject, proceed to devise other plans of military defence, was highly objectionable. He did not deny the right of the house to do so; but he was certain that nothing but the overbearing necessity could induce the house to assume the initiation of measures which, in general, it was adviseable to leave to the executive government The additional force act, he was convinced, would produce men if it had a fair opportunity of being tried; And if parishes found that there was no chance of its being repealed, exertions for that purpose would be made. As to the raising of the penalties, the law possessed means of enforcing them, audit was just and necessary for the public service, that in this, as in many other cases, and particularly in cases of a similar kind last war, they should be enforced. Notwithstanding the charges of imbecility and weakness, so boldly made against the late ministry, they had done everything that any: men, that all the talents and property of is the country could have been expected to do for the public safety. As to the decay of the influence of this country, owing to the treaty of Amiens, he observed, that the influence of this country on the continent was as little before that treaty as after le it. One advantage of that treaty was, that Id it had afforded the means of preparing ct those effectual measures of defence that al had been provided in this war, into which we had been driven, by leading to that unanimity which had facilitated our exertions. Upon the whole, he saw no advantage to be derived from that revision of acts which had been, highly beneficial to the state, which were suspended because
<image src="S1V0003P0I0427"/>
<col>825</col>
they had done their business; and particularly he was adverse to that part of the motion which proposed to go into a committee to devise farther measures of military defence&#x2014;a proposal wholly unwarranted by the circumstances of the country.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01575"><member>The Duke of Clarence</member><membercontribution> stated shortly his reasons for supporting the motion. He thought that every part of our military establishment deserved serious revision. He referred to his own calculations respecting the extraordinary deficiencies in our regular force, compared with its actual amount, and contended that the more he considered this subject, the more he was convinced of the necessity of going into the inquiry which his noble friend had proposed. Another noble friend of his had, on a former occasion, alluded to the defence act, and had exposed its nullity in strong and conclusive terms. This, however, was the only thing which ministers had even attempted to increase our disposable force, and no noble lord could look at its effects without owning, if be spoke his real sentiments, that to trust to such a measure as a means of recruiting our army was little better than downright trifling. He thought that a noble viscount opposite (lord Sidmouth) and some of his late friends, were bound in consistency to vote for the committee if it were for no purpose but that of getting rid of a bill, which last session they had so severely condemned. Among other topics which his R. H. employed in support of the motion, was the state of the army employed in the colonies. The immense draughts of our regular troops to the West India Islands had long been a matter of deep regret, and the means of counteracting this evil had long occupied the attention of military men. The plan of employing corps of Sepoys in these settlements was one which had long struck him as worthy of serious consideration, and which would, if the committee were granted, of course be fully and deliberately enquired into. Many other important points, which on? this as well as on former occasions had been referred, would also demand serious investigation. His R. H. alluded to the present state of the naval defence, which he maintained was inferior in efficiency to what was supported by the noble lord lately at the head of the naval department. Here again he conceived a noble viscount opposite (lord Sidmouth) called on to state whether he gave any countenance to the accusation brought forward in another
<col>826</col>
place against the late admiralty. Honour as well as manliness called on the. noble viscount to disavow such accusations, if he thought them unfounded.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01576"><member>Lord Sidmouth</member><membercontribution> intreated the indulgence of the house for a few moments, the more so, as he was solicitous to answer what he could not help conceiving to be a personal attack. He was particularly hurt by the insinuations of the illustrious personage who just sat down, which seemed pointedly to accuse him of versatility and inconsistency. He must beg leave to say, that: such a charge, in the present instance, from whatever quarter it might come, was wholly without foundation. He had often been called upon to deliver his opinion respecting the measure which formed the chief topic of this night's debate; and on no occasion did he advance any sentiments different from those which he bad formerly expressed respecting it. He had always asserted that it would not be attended with that immediate effect which it was supposed could result from it; and if he now consented to give it a fuller and more prolonged trial, it was out of respect for the sanction of the legislature by which it had been harboured. Never was it his idea or intention that it should oppress the people in the form of a tax; and should it be proved so to operate, it should no longer meet with his approbation and support. With respect to the great variety of extraneous topics which had been introduced into the debate, and many of which, had been personally directed against himself, he should only say, that most of them, if not all, had no real foundation in fact. A noble baron (Grenville) had, on this and many other occasions, been very prodigal of opprobrious epithets in describing the administration of which, he bad formed a part. The terms imbecility and incapacity were continually used to characterise it; but he still did not fear to challeuge that noble baron, or any other noble lord who indulged in the same accusations, to come forward with; the statement of any one particular measure of his administration to which those insulting terms could justly apply. In the naval department he had seen nothing but wisdom, energy, and unremitting activity, and he should never in that house suffer any contrary assertion to pass uncontradicted. The same observation he felt himself called on to make, as to all the other departments. Every one of the measures by which the army was aug-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0428"/>
<col>827</col>
mented, had originated with the late ministers. The foreign corps, the German Legion, the Irish Levies, not to mention the very extensive measure of the Army of Reserve, were all planned and put in a train of execution before any change in the: government took place. As to the defence act, on which so much had been Said by many noble lords, he certainly had, in the first instance, disapproved of it, and though his opinion was not changed as to the principle, he was bound to bow to the wisdom of parliament which had formed it into a law. As it was now a law, he was desirous that the measure should be fairly tried on a great scale, and if it should not succeed, it would then be in the power bf noble lords to move for its repeal &#x2014; With respect to the much condemned treaty of Amiens, such as that treaty was, it had been productive of the best consequences to the country. It was made under the necessity that the government should no longer resist the voice of the people for peace; and in yielding to that call, government gave rise to that conviction, which since had been productive of the best effects, namely, that the nation were now sensible that a great and last exertion must be made to give security and: permanence to whatever treaty may hereafter be entered into. It is to that treaty Of Amiens that the country is also indebted for any improvement that may have since been made in our relative situation as to the continent. The moderation which that treaty evinced on our part, and the views that it opened to the great powers of Europe, more particularly to those of the North, were among the principal fetuses of the friendly disposition which they have since manifested towards this country. The noble viscount concluded by deprecating the present motion as a measure that must be practically mischievous in as much as it must tend, under such a critical situation of the country, to unhinge all the measures that have? hitherto been devised for its defence and security.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01577"><member>Lord Melville</member><membercontribution> vindicated the measures of fete administration of which he had formed a part, in conjunction with the noble bacon (Grenville), who this night had been no acrimonious in his charge against his Bitter colleagues. Not one of the measures that had been adopted but he could fully justify, and the noble baron must be sensible as he was of the expediency or
<col>828</col>
the necessity by which they were vindicated. The noble viscount expatiated on the merits of our victories in Egypt, and claimed the full praise of them to the administration of which he was then a member. He was not a little astonished at the mode of proceeding which some noble lords had adopted in defending the motion: almost the whole of their arguments were directed against the Additional Force bill, and seemed to have nothing in view but its repeal. This surely was not a very parliamentary mode of proceeding; for not much more than a fortnight ago a motion had been directly made and negatived by that house for a repeal of that act; yet, if the arguments urged now in defence of the present motion were properly considered, they would be found to have no other object in view but the repeal of that act, respecting which their lordships had already decided.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01578"><member>Earl Spencer</member><membercontribution> could not but express, his surprise at the complete misrepresentation, by the noble viscount, of what had been advanced on his side of the house. It was not merely the repeal of the defence act which the present motion had in contemplation, but a great variety of other improvements, and the adoption of other means by which our military system might be much perfected. Equally inconsistent was the noble and learned lord on the woolsack in urging the same objection; for when the repeal of the act was proposed, that learned lord opposed the Motion on the ground that it referred to a single measure, and to no new system of measures that might tend to supply its place. When a motion was now proposed to furnish that new system or the opportunity of devising it, that motion equally met with the learned lord's disapprobation and opposition. Such misrepresentations and inconsistencies it was impossible for him to allow to pass by unnoticed and un-reproved. Of the necessity of such a motion as the present he was convinced, and under that conviction he must vote for its adoption.&#x2014;The question was loudly called for, and on a division there appeared for the motion&#x2014;

<p id="S1V0003P0-01580">The Chancellor of the Exchequer moved the order of the day for resuming the adjourned debate, and the report of the Middlesex committee relative to the conduct of the Sheriffs of Middlesex.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01581"><member>Mr. Sheridan</member><membercontribution> rose for the purpose of opposing the resumption of the debate now. His intention was, if the house should agree with him in negativing that motion, to follow up the question by a motion for hearing counsel on behalf of the sheriff's previous to resuming the debate on some future day, it was not his wish to enter
<col>830</col>
into the merits of, the question, nor to discuss, whether evidence, should be. examined. At the bar, or the resolutions of Committee be adopted by the house? These considerations were altogether out of his view in the present instance. However these questions might be finally disposed of, he contended that the house could not consistently with justice agree to the report without bearing what the parties had to say. It had been argued on a former day, that it would be idle in the house to try this question, because if had already been fully tried by the committee themselves, on oath, and on evidence taken, upon oath, with the advantage of the comments of counsel, and a view of the countenances of the witnesses. The question therefore was, whether the house should or should not agree to the? report of the committee, without the advantage at least of hearing counsel. The committee had given to the house with its report, the evidence that had been taken before it, in order to enable the house to ascertain, whether the resolutions were borne out by the evidence; and be maintained, that no hon. gent, would consistently agree to them, until be was convinced of their being so borne out He did not argue that all the evidence should be gone over, but that gentlemen should have the assistance of counsel to guide their judgments upon that which had been laid before there He understood that the noble lord who, had so ably presided over both the Middlesex committees, intended to support the motion for hearing counsel, and he hoped, the committee would act with the same, noble impartiality. There was one preliminary question which it was necessary to establish here. If the sheriffs had not been, heard at all, neither the right hon. gent opposite, nor any other gent. could contend that they ought not to be heard. If heard at all, they ought to be heard fully; and what evidence had the house, to what extent they had been heard, whether to their own satisfaction fully, completely and impartially? It appeared indeed that; they had been heard, but he denied that they had been folly beard; and if the house should decide against the hearing of counsel, it would be better for the returning officer not to be heard at all before the committee. Besides, the whole of the evidence was not before the house, but such parts of it as the noble lord and the committee bad selected as sufficient to en-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0430"/>
<col>831</col>
able the house to form a judgment of the conduct of the sheriff. In his mind the whole evidence should be had for that purpose, and counsel ought to be heard to ascertain whether any more than they had was necessary. The sheriffs had no notice of their conduct having been under consideration until they accidentally heard of it, and when they applied to have the consideration deferred until after the whole of the case should be gone through, in order that they might have the benefit of all the evidence that might be produced, which was denied them. They had but a single day to prepare their briefs and defence, and that was five mouths previous to the resolutions being adopted by the committee. There was nothing, he contended, in the act, which gave the committee a power to try the sheriffs. The right hon. gent. Had triumphantly stated that the whole matter of the petition was referred to the committee. This he admitted quoad the seat, but not as to the sheriffs, any more than as to peers who might have interfered in the election, or any other persons not implicated in it. The committee quoad the seat, acted as a petty jury whose decision was final; but resembled a grand jury in their proceedings, touching such other matters, the house having reserved to itself the right of final decision upon them. In the case of Mr. Davison, no mention had been made of him in the petition from Ilehelster, though something came out in evidence before the Committee which they made the ground of special report. What course did the house adopt? Did they send him to Newgate? No, they sent him to his trial. All the precedents were against the opinion of the right hon. gent. In the Shoreham case, which had occurred within a year after the passing of Mr. Grenville's Bill, whilst Sir G. Saville, Lord J. Cavendish, Mr. Dunning, and Mr. Wedderburne, who had been the most strenuous and zealous supporters of that bill, were in the house, no conclusion was come to against the returning Officer till he was heard in his defence. There was no other precedent which, bore upon the present case. With respect to the general question he should beg leave to submit a few questions to the house, which, to save them trouble and time, he should answer himself, and by monosyllables. Does the house, or does the law, give a copy of the charge against them to the returning, offi-
<col>832</col>
cers? No.&#x2014;Have the committee power to bring the returning officers to trial? no?&#x2014;Have the returning officers power to oblige the committee to try them? No &#x2014;Have they the right of challenging any number of the jury by which they are to try them? No.&#x2014;Have they a voice in appointing them? No.&#x2014;Have they a voice in appointing nominees? no. In a case where there were three parties, two were allowed to chuse nominees in the house, whilst the third was put upon trial without any such advantage. He contended therefore, that the sheriffs had aright to be heard by counsel. It had been frequently of late thrown in the teeth of the house that they could not examine witnesses on oath. This could never have been the spirit of the constitution, and if they had not that power, it was time they should have it, and he was sure no branch of the legislature would object to it. Here he thought it not amiss to advert to what had been the practice of the Irish parliament in similar cases. The question often occurred, and the practice had been to retry the sheriffs, and hear over all the evidence. This had been found troublesome and laborious to the house, and therefore they passed an act, whereby the copy of the charge was directed to be given to the sheriff, and the committee had power to try the whole case, so that decision was final and conclusive on the house. On a future day he, should move for leave to bring in a bill similar to that which had been passed in Ireland. He concluded by moving that the word "now" be left out.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01582"><member>Lord Marsham</member><membercontribution> concurred in the object of the hon. gent. though he differed with him in his statements of facts, and the conclusions which he drew from them. He agreed with that hon. gent. in wishing the sheriffs to be heard by counsel, and on this subject there had been hardly any difference in the committee, whose sentiments he expressed. The whole of the evidence undoubtedly had not been laid before the house, but such parts had been selected as were best calculated to enable them to form a just opinion on the conduct of the sheriffs. All that dry part of the evidence respecting particular votes, which could throw no light on the subject, had been omitted. As to the assertion that the sheriffs had not been fully heard, he should say, that though the committee had informed their counsel that they need not attend during the whole of the scrutiny.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0431"/>
<col>833</col>
the counsel for the sitting member had attended to their interests, and were allowed the privilege of cross-examination. The noble Lord concluded with declaring his wish and that of the committee to be, that Counsel should be heard.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01583"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> thought it unnecessary to trouble the house, after the opinion that had been given by the noble lord. He should only observe, that all the arguments that had been used on a former day applied against the hearing of evidence, not against the hearing of counsel. The argument had been that the evidence on oath before the committee was better than any parole evidence. The house had decided this question; but he, notwithstanding that decision, remained of his former opinion, and thought that evidence out to be heard before they agreed to the report of the committee, and consequently counsel. The committee had had the advantage of the comments of counsel, of which they had not made any report. Why should not the house have the enjoyment of that advantage. It had been argued that the house ought to have confidence in their committee and agree to the report. But why stop there? why not place the same confidence in their recommendation to hear counsel. He thought it an extraordinary circumstance that a member, of great weight in that house for talents and official situation, should come down and persuade the house to a conclusion in the teeth of all his precedents. He hoped that some way would be found out for hearing counsel, on the present case, as the contrary course would not be very honourable to the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01584"><member>The Master of the Rolls</member><membercontribution> was of opinion that some legislative measure ought to be resorted to, in order to settle this question, which certainly stood at present upon bad grounds. Either the committee should have the whole judgment of the case, or the house should retain it altogether. The question whether counsel should be heard, was not to be decided by any abstract reasoning, but by what had been the practice of parliament. All courts of justice had the same principles. He did not know how far the sheriffs were bound by the report of the committee; that was to be regulated by the practice of the house. The hon. gent. had said that he did not agree with the decision of the house on a former day. He had not been himself in the house at the time of that decision, but fully concurred in it. There had been no
<col>834</col>
instance of hearing evidence or counsel on the report of a select committee, when election cases were referred to such committees formerly; and since the Grenville act, there was additional reason for confiding in the report of select committees. There was nothing in that act to give to the house the power which it had never exercised with respect to former select committees. No court of appeal tries the merits of a judgment, but the evidence on which that judgment is founded. It would be an anomaly to distribute the power of decision, half to the committee, and half to the house. They had the written evidence, but they had not the advantage of confronting the witnesses; and therefore it would be desirable to hear counsel. If they were to try the whole case, they should hear evidence, and as it might be possible that such evidence might induce them to reject the evidence taken before the committee, he could not easily say what course in such case ought to be adopted. Exculpatory evidence to might be produced, which would also lead to difficulty respecting the resolutions of the committee. All these circumstances proved that some legislative measure was necessary to 9hew how the returning officers should be tried. Great inconvenience would arise from allowing a full hearing in the committee and in the house. A clause similar to the provision of the act in Ireland had been proposed to be added to Mr. Grenville's bill in 1778, but was afterwards, he knew not why, withdrawn. If he were to judge from the mere reason of the thing, he should be of opinion that counsel ought to be heard. Every court was infinitely assisted by hearing the arguments of counsel, in forming its decision. No judge, if he were to receive the case in writing, and consider it in his closet, could have the same comprehensive and clear view of it as after having had the advantage of the arguments of counsel. It was impossible for any one mind to consider ail the bearings of a case, as completely as he would be enabled to do after it has been discussed by a number of persons. For his own part he wished for the benefit of counsel. The only point was, whether that would be consistent with, the practice of the house. It had been said in a former debate by some gentlemen, that it would be proper to hear counsel in some state of the business, but he was of opinion that if they were to be heard in any, it ought to be the present stage,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0432"/>
<col>835</col>
which would be more advantageous to the house, and to the parties, than if they if were to be heard when they came to discuss the degree of punishment. There was a total absence of precedents, for there was no case of counsel being offered. If the case had been only left sub silentio, it would be for the house to determine how far it should admit a practice on which the law was silent. He threw out these observations for the purpose of their being considered by those who were more conversant with the usage of parliament.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01585"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> perceived that the question was rendered much narrower than in a former debate, when the hon. gent.' (Mr. Fox) argument went to hearing the whole of the case. The motion of the hon. gent. (Mr. Sheridan) which he understood the other hon. member to acquiesce in was solely confined to the hearing of counsel. If counsel were at all to be heard, this was the time; and if the house should be of that opinion, he should not object to it. At the same time he confessed, that from the best consideration he had been able to bestow on the subject, he was not aware of any case in which the party had been heard either by his counsel or by himself. But there were a variety of cases, and no doubt there must be some of them bearing on this question, and she wing what was the sense of parliament upon it. The resolution of the committee had been accompanied with the evidence, and appeared to him to come under the fourth head contained in the report of the committee appointed in 1789 to examine into precedents. He did not think, and he was sure no gent, who heard him could think, that much light could be thrown upon the particular case by the arguments of counsel, however it might be desirable with a view to the general principle to have them called in Me agreed, that the question ought to be decided not by any abstract reasoning, but by what had been the practice of the house. The point of importance was, not to set the example of departing from the practice of parliament, nor to follow the example of attributing less weight to the decision of their committees. As, however, a number of gentlemen seemed to be of opinion that counsel should be heard, and his learned friend also inclined to that opinion, he should not have any objection, provided, however, it was to be clearly understood, that no other proposition was to be grounded on his agreeing to this.</membercontribution></p>
<col>836</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01586"><member>Mr. Sheridan</member><membercontribution> explained by observing, that he was still of opinion with his hon. friend near him, that evidence ought to be heard, though he only how contended for hearing counsel. With regard to the evidence on the scrutiny, if it appeared there that a number of voters who had no legal title to vote had been received for Mr. Mainwaring, equal to that of the mill voters, then the charge of corruption would be done away.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01587"><member>Mr. Fuller</member><membercontribution> said, that he was sorry to observe in the enumeration made by the hon. gent. who opened the debate, he had omitted the mention of his relation, Mr. Rose Fuller, who sat as chairman of the committee which framed that bill, and was as strenuous in support of it, as Sir G. Saville, or any of those whom the hon. gent. had selected a gentleman who was only attached to the service of his courttry, and kept himself always free from the contests of any parties.<lb/>
A short conversation then took place respecting the proper course to be followed; when the question that the debate be now resumed, was carried in the affirmative for the purpose of moving afterwards that counsel be called in.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01588"><member>Mr. Sheridan</member><membercontribution> then informed the house that the learned gentlemen, supposing the proceedings would be the same as on the former night, were not prepared to proceed.</membercontribution></p>

But when the debate had been last adjourned, it was under a distinct notice of the present motion, and therefore the counsel ought to have been prepared.

If the counsel, when called in, could assign any good reason for not being prepared to proceed, he should have no objection to agree to any convenient interval, before the debate should be resumed.&#x2014;he order for resuming the debate being then read, and, the counsel being called in, on the motion of Mr. Sheridan,</membercontribution></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01591"><member>Mr. Adam</member><membercontribution> appeared at the bar, as counsel for the sheriffs, and stated, that he was not perfectly prepared; but, if the house desired, he would proceed in the best manner he could. He allowed it was highly unbecoming in any man to appear at the bar of the House of Commons, otherwise than with every preparation which the best exertion of his faculties would enable him to attain. But if he might take the liberty of alluding to any thing that had passed in that house, there were some circumstances that had appeared in the printed votes of the house, which, in some measure, justified his precent deficiency of preparation; It was at first to be understood from these votes, that it was the intention of the house to hear counsel; from a subsequent vote, it was understood that counsel was not to be heard. He was now in attendance merely from the accident of having been in the neighbourhood, which had afforded his clients the opportunity of informing him that his presence was likely to be required. He took the liberty to remind the house, that there was no order for hearing counsel this day; and though having formerly turned his mind very attentively to the whole of the circumstances of this case, and the law connected with it, he may possibly be still capable of calling many branches of it to his recollection so as not to be totally unqualified to present a statement of it to the house; yet he would consider it as matter of favour to himself, and advantage, to his clients, if he was allowed time to review the case. He, therefore, conjured the house, to permit him again to look attentively over the precedents of parliament in this case, from the earliest times, and the law connected with them; as without this revision, he could but ill discharge his duty. The indulgence of the house would be applied by him in the best manner he could to the convenience of the house itself, by concentrating all that was important in the facts of the case, in the precedents, and the law upon them, so as to take up as little time as possible in his statement.&#x2014;The counsel having withdrawn;</membercontribution></p>

He trusted further, that gentlemen would come prepared to bring the matter to a final decision, as the hearing of counsel, now that the hearing of evidence was no longer insisted upon, would not take up so much time as to prevent the house from coming to a decision the same night. He would move that this debate be further adjourned till Monday, and that counsel be then heard. He trusted farther, that as no other business would stand for that day, the house would proceed to this matter at four o'clock.&#x2014;The debate was accordingly adjourned till Monday.&#x2014;djourned.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[MIDDLESEX ELECTION.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01595">On the motion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the order for hearing counsel upon the report of the committee respecting the conduct of Messrs. Rawlins and Cox at the Middlesex Election of 1802, was read, and the counsel being accordingly called in;</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01596"><member>Mr. Adam</member><membercontribution> appeared at the bar. The learned counsel began by expressing his thanks to the house for the indulgence shewn him on a former evening, by postponing the consideration of this subject, and thus affording him an opportunity of more satisfactorily preparing his mind for the discharge of the important duty which belonged to him. For this he was the more grateful, because he was thus enabled to do that which, notwithstanding the utmost solicitude for the interest of his clients, he felt it unnecessary to do before the committee, upon whose report the house was now called on to decide. Before he proceeded to shew that the resolutions of that committee were unfounded in law, and the justice of the case, and that they were not sustained by the evidence on the table, he took occasion to observe, that from the order made in pursuance of which he appeared at that bar, the resolutions were perfectly open for discussion. He also felt himself intitled to think, that the mind of the house was quite open upon the subject. If, then, he could make it appear that the committee had drawn conclusions from the evidence in charging the sheriffs with corruption, which that evidence did not warrant, and which were quite irreconcileable with all the probabilities arising out of the nature of the case and the character of the sheriffs, he had little doubt, that not only the mind of the house at large, but that of the illustrious persons of whom, the committee was composed, would be prompt to determine against the resolutions. In those resolutions he begged the house to observe, that the committee had not only exceeded the evidence, but the charges of the petitioners who originally complained of the conduct of the sheriffs. The petitioners complained of the sheriffs having acted unduly: but the committee resolved that they acted corruptly, and did, knowingly and wilfully, admit fictitious votes to be put upon
<col>840</col>
the poll; that they acted in one instance ministerially and in another judicially, as it suited their corrupt views, to promote the election of sir F. Burdett. This farmed the substance of the 3 first of their 4 resolutions; and if the basis of those 3 should appear to be unsound, the 4th,which was a consequence deduced from them, must vanish of course. Now, us to the corrupt motive alleged, he could not conceive any allegation more unfounded, and unless that motive should appear to the house to have actuated the conduct of those gentlemen, it was impossible that it could come to a decision grounded upon the resolutions of the committee. The questions for the house to consider were these, whether the sheriffs had done their duty according to the best of their ability; whether in the situation in which they were placed, they could have done better; whether, without the power of investigating a case of difficulty by the examination of witnesses, having no authority of administering an oath to any person but the freeholder, and only that with respect to his freehold, they were right in resorting to that course which accorded with the usual practice at, elections, and which was prescribed by the law. Sheriffs were, the house would bear in mind, generally incompetent, from the nature of their education, to decide upon matters of law; and, this in competency was more naturally to be expected in the sheriffs of Middlesex than among the country gentlemen, as many of the former were persons who rose from success, perhaps, in mechanical professions, to the office of sheriffs. However, in consequence of this general in competency, great indulgence was due to mistakes of sheriffs where no corruption appeared; otherwise an office which held out no profit, but rather great expence and trouble, would be au extremely dangerous post. The sheriffs in this as in other cases of election, chose proper persons to assist; them, by their judgment on questions of law. That those persons were not wrong in the advice they gave in the disputed points which the house were, about to examine, would appear, he believed, very clearly from a revision of the acts of the 7th of Henry VI. the 7lh and 8th of Wm, III. the 10th of Anne, and the 18th of Geo, II. which pointed out the regulations relative to the administration of the freeholders oath; also the resolutions of the House, of Commons, on the York and
<image src="S1V0003P0I0435"/>
<col>841</col>
Dorset cases in 1625. From those latter; and other decisions referred to by Serjeant Glanville, the power of the sheriff was defined; and it was confined to this, that when objection was made to a freeholder tendering his vote, the sheriffs having no power to inquire judicially into the objections, they had no criterion to recur to but the path of such freeholder as to the value and time of possession, and such other points as are prescribed in the act of the 18th Geo. II. Such was the course adopted by his clients, and that course they uniformly followed throughout the election, as well with respect to the voters on one side as on the other. It appeared from the evidence of Messrs. Bushnell and Burchell, who assisted his clients with their advice, that a meeting took place the night before the election, at which a rule was laid down, among other arrangements, that in every case of objection to a voter, the voter's oath should be the criterion of decision, and that should the voter persist in tendering his vote, that vote should be received unless it came within the knowledge of the sheriffs or their assessors, that the party claiming had no right to vote. From this rule his clients never swerved; upon the ground of this rule, they admitted the voters from the inns of court and the public offices in favour of Mr. Mainwaring; on the same rule they admitted the mill voters for Sir F. Burdett. There was no case whatever, in which the oath of persons tendering their votes was rejected; but, in that of those claiming from the Emanuel hospital, the tenure of which Mr. Bushnel happened to know not to be a freehold; and those rejected persons, the learned counsel wished the house to bear in mind, tendered for Sir F. Burdett. The learned counsel traced the conduct of his clients through the several days of the election up to the 12th, during which he maintained that the evidence would bear him in stating that the regulations they adopted were approved of by both parties, and were in all cases applied with the most rigid adherence to justice and impartiality. That the charge of a conspiracy to promote the election of Sir F. Burdett by the introduction of the mill voters was utterly inapplicable to his clients, the learned gent. shewed by a reference to the evidence, as it relates to those voters. From that it appeared that the existence, of such voters was net known to the sheriffs until the morning of the 13th day of election, when
<col>842</col>
Albion Cooper and others came to the poll. The testimony of Mr. Clifford stated that those voters were discovered by him accidentally on the 6th day of the election, and that he kept it a secret for several days. The learned counsel therefore argued that his clients could have no pre-knowledge of the intention to produce such, voters. Upon the day the first set of them came to the booth, Cooper and others were taken round to the sheriffs' box, to have their claim discussed. This practice of taking objected voters round to the sheriffs' box to have their objections investigated, he observed, had prevailed from the commencement of the election, with the implied consent of all parties. After Cooper and the others had gone round, a discussion arose, which continued above four hours, the counsel on both sides being present. But yet it being impossible to decide the fact as to the tenure of the voters from the inability of the sheriffs, as he before stated, they determined to act upon the rule laid from the beginning. They, therefore, after fully explaining in the most solemn manner, to Cooper and the others who accompanied him, the nature of an oath, they requested him to deliberate upon what he was about to do, acquainting him, however, that if he persisted in demanding to vote, his vote must be received, upon taking the freeholder's oath. Cooper and his companions retired, and after some time came forward again to the hustings and tendered their votes. Mr. Burchell went to the front of the hustings, repeated a solemn admonition to them, and administered the oath to them; this oath they took, notwithstanding the menace of Mr. Sylvester to prosecute them for perjury. On the 14rth day it was stated by Mr. Sylvester, in his evidence, that he tendered the act of W. III. to sheriff Rawlins, and called upon him for a reconsideration of the case of the millers; but to this application, which was seconded by Mr. Mainwaring, sheriff Rawlins replied, that the case had been decided the day before, and that he would not go into it again. Mr. Sylvester also stated, that sheriff Rawlins would not suffer him or Mr. Mainwaring to put questions to the voters on the hustings, on the 15th day. Now, in point of fact, the act of W. III, which sheriff Rawlins refused to consider, had no relation to the question, and to permit the interrogation proposed by Mr. Sylvester on the hustings would be inconsistent with the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0436"/>
<col>843</col>
practice that antecedently prevailed without any exception, to; take votes objected to round to the sheriffs' box. This practice arose from a wish to prevent the interruption of the poll. It was acted upon during the 1st and 2d days of the election, when voters were crowding at the hustings for Mr. Mainwaring; and he would therefore put it to the candour of any man, whether it would not be the grossest injustice to allow any deviation from that practice on the last day of the election, when voters were crowding to the hustings for Sir F. Burdett. Mr. Sylvester also complained that he was rudely treated by sheriff Rawlins, but another, witness, Mr. Cater, who was present in the sheriffs' box when the thing complained of arose, stated that which fully justified the conduct of Mr. Rawlins, and that the demeanour of the complainant was very different from that which one would have a right to expect. From the rank and profession of Mr. Sylvester, he felt it an unpleasant task to make any observation upon him. He was no doubt, as a crown lawyer, respectable; and administered the law, in the court in which he presided, with much credit; but yet he must say, that in election law, it was clear that that learned gent was out of his proper sphere, that he undertook a new trade: Ne sutor ultra crepidam.&#x2014;With respect to the charge against his clients, of refusing to examine the voters upon the land-tax assessments at the request of Mr. Mainwaring's friends, he begged to state to the house, that this request was not made until the 7th day of the election. Not a word was heard of it on the first day, when Mr. Mainwairing polled above 1,000 voters; and he would submit it to the consideration of the house, whether it would afterwards be fair, whatever might be the power of the sheriffs, to comply with that request, to establish a rule on the 7th day, that had been entirely overlooked during the preceding part of the election? Would this be dealing equitably towards all parties, as his clients had determined to do? The resolution of the committee charged his clients with admitting some mill voters on the 14th day, and rejecting some of the same description of voters who tendered their votes on the same principle on the 15th day, in order to preserve the majority of Sir F. Burdett. In the whole of the evidence, he could not find, one tittle to
<col>844</col>
sustain this allegation. The fact was, that in consequence of a suggestion from Sir W. Gibbons, who was a friend of Mr. Mainwaring's, on the evening of the 14th day, that some persons1 were expected to tender their votes on the following day for the Good Intent Mill, who had only just purchased shares for the purpose of voting, Mr. Rawlins questioned the first class of mill voters who presented themselves on that morning, and finding they were not qualified to vote, from time of possession, they were rejected. Now, although those rejected persons tendered for Mr. Mainwaring, it must be obvious that as at the time of their rejection that gentleman was 25 a-head on the poll, and also that the rejection occurred in consequence of the previous suggestion of Sir W. Gibbons, the corrupt motives which the resolution was of the committee ascribed to his clients completely inapplicable. As to the statement in the testimony of Turner Smith, who described himself as a roving commissioner of inspection for Mr. Mainwaring on the hustings, that on the 15th day the freeholder's oath was gabbled over by the voters for the purpose of expedition; that statement was most positively and pointedly contradicted, by the evidence of Messrs, Cater, who were the sheriff's agents for the administration of the oath, and who swore that they were enjoined to administer the oath in all cases with due solemnity.&#x2014;Having gone through various parts of the evidence, to shew the facts of the case with respect to the conduct of his clients, he recurred to a consideration of the law. He maintained that the same principle of law must apply universally: that there could not be one law for Lancashire and Yorkshire, and another for Middlesex and Rutland, The spirit of the law did, he was quite convinced, sanction the rule laid down and acted upon by his clients. The law could not enact that which it would be physically impossible to execute. It allowed but 15 days for any election, and if the returning officers were to act judiciously, if they were to enquire into any disputed vote; if they were, to act otherwise than his clients had acted, to resort to the criterion of an oath upon all difficult cases, it would be utterly impossible to go through in 15 days the election of such a county as Yorkshire, to, receive above 40,000 votes. Indeed, it evidently was not the intention of the statute, that the returning officer should, act any other
<image src="S1V0003P0I0437"/>
<col>845</col>
than ministerially during those 15 days. If the close investigation of the votes were demanded, what was called the scrutiny act, prescribed 30 days for the continuance of such investigation. During this scrutiny the sheriffs were invested with judicial power, and the distinction between the 15 and 30 days clearly proved that the returning officers were merely authorised, in the first instance, to administer the freeholders' oath, and not entitled to go into any scrutiny of the freeholders' claim. If, indeed, the returning officer should refuse to receive the vote of a freeholder, who should express his readiness to take the oath, such returning officer would be liable to an action, from which, even should the verdict be in his favour, he could not escape without some loss. This consideration would, he trusted, combined with the law and the facts he had slated, produce in the mind of the house a due degree of indulgence for the situation in which his clients were placed, and render the house slow to pronounce a verdict of guilty against men who were so circumstanced, and who had so acted. The learned counsel denied that his clients had come to any adjudication that rendered them liable to the charge of acting judicially on the last day of the election, as Mr. Sylvester seemed to infer. The fact was, that the persons tendering on the occasion to which the adjudication was said to refer, could not conscientiously take the oath. If they would take that oath, their votes must have been received and put on the poll. The learned counsel concluded a most able, luminous, and comprehensive speech, replete with legal knowledge and forcible argument, by conjuring the house to weigh well the circumstances in which his clients were placed; to take a fair and full review of the conduct they had pursued throughout the election; that being themselves not legally educated, they Bad acted under the advice of those who were;&#x2014;that although they might be mistaken, their uniform unvarying application of the same rules to all parties proved that they were not corrupt. Addressing himself to an enlightened assembly, he trusted that the fate of his clients would be consistent with its character, and with the force of their claims. As soon as the counsel had withdrawn from the bar,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01597"><member>The Speaker</member><membercontribution> put the question, that the house do agree with the resolutions of this committee, the substance of which was,
<col>846</col>
that the sheriffs of Middlesex had been guilty of partiality and corruption, particularly on the 13th, 14th, and 15th, days of election, by admitting persons to voe who claimed under right of their being partners in the Good Intent Mill, in the parish of Isle worth, so as by that means to give a colourable majority to Sir F. Burdett, and also by refusing to admit other persons to poll in favour of Mr. Mainwaring.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01598"><member>Mr. Rose</member><membercontribution> said, he had given his whole attention to this case, and he conceived it as strong as possible in favour of the resolution. He was happy the sheriffs had had the benefit of counsel, who had discharged his duty so ably; that if it were possible for any argument to alter the impression of plain and strong facts, he would have made their criminality disappear. He saw in the whole of the proceedings of the election a general partiality of the sheriffs in favour of one of the candidates. They had from this partiality put on the poll a number of votes notoriously bad; they had acted in some cases judicially, in others ministerially: they had admitted the mill votes contrary to every possible right. Here the right hon. gent. entered into a detail of the partial conduct of the sheriffs. They had a person who was called the orator to declaim against Mr. Mainwaring in front of the hustings, and to apply every vilifying expression to that gent.; and when the impropriety was represented to them, they contented themselves with saying he was a droll fellow. They permitted the flags of Sir F. Burdett to be displayed in front of the hustings, with the motto of "No bastile" upon them; they suffered black bread and dead vermin to be exhibited, as if this were a specimen of the treatment in a prison with which Mr. Mainwaring was supposed to be connected. A man naked from the waist upwards, of an emaciated appearance, was exhibited with another flogging him, with a view to cast odium on the same gentleman. All this was permitted for several days, notwithstanding it was allowed there was a sufficiency of constables in attendance to put a stop to such disgraceful scenes. When Mr. Mainwaring attempted to speak, an outcry was raised which rendered it impossible for him to be heard. When Sir F. Burdett abused the Bastile, one of the sheriffs' prompted him; and the sheriffs' clerks wore Burdett's colours. When facilities were given for inflaming the mob, which
<image src="S1V0003P0I0438"/>
<col>847</col>
there was no possibility of governing when it was once agitated, what mischief may follow it was impossible to calculate! To prove that votes notoriously bad had been received, it was sufficient to state, that one man had been allowed to vote from the heart of the city, which the sheriffs must have known to be illegal. Till the 5th day the votes had been examined, when the right of admission was put solely upon the tender of the oath. He censured the conduct of Sir W. Rawlins, who had rudely prevented Mr. Mainwaring and Mr. Silvester from questioning some of the mill voters on the hustings to the same point on which he himself rejected others of them the next day. Here the right hon. gent. entered into an examination of the nature of the interest of the mill voters, whose property consisted of one-eighth of an acre of land, 90 feet by 45, with three cottages on it, let each for six guineas a year, when they took it. These had been thrown down to erect the mill, to which there were 1002 subscribers, at 2 guineas each. The mill was not then roofed; nor was it assessed even to the poor's rate for a year after; and the reason the parish officers gave was, that they were afraid the proprietors would all come to the parish as paupers. It was impossible under these circumstances, that there could be an interest of 40s. to each individual. He contended that the assessment to the land tax was a point indispensable by the law, independent of any agreement between candidates or parties. The clerk of the peace was in attendance with the rolls, and the Sheriffs were ineffectually called upon to go into the examination. The neglect of this duty was carried so far, that one voter from Waltham bridge had been admitted, though he allowed he had not been assessed. He allowed that Mr. Burchell and Mr. Bushnan were respectable solicitors, but the sheriffs should have had regular counsel, as Mr. Walsh, the second under sheriff had recommended. If the oath were to be the criterion, elections would be carried by chimney-sweepers and link-boys, and by whoever could command a corrupt mob. It was true no violence had been committed, but the danger and intimidation to Mr. Mainwaring and his voters was dreadful. Though a false return may only establish the sitting member for a session, yet the event might deprive the country of its fair representation during a whole parliament, from the impression
<col>848</col>
of the danger, the expence, the anxiety, and the fatigue of a second contest. The house was called upon now to decide whether the right of election for Middlesex was to be in the returning officers, or where the constitution had vested it. No man that heard him could delight in the punishment of the individuals concerned, if the house should think proper to punish them. The end of all punishment inflicted by the house, was not to give pain to the individual, but to prevent a repetition of the offence. In this view, when the house should have agreed to the resolution of the committee, as he had no doubt it would, he should, follow it up with another proposition.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01599"><member>Mr. P. Moore</member><membercontribution> expressed his astonishment at the extreme frivolity of some of the observations of the right hon. gent. who had just sat down. If the committee had fallen into an error, he was sure nothing could be further from the intention of the noble lord who had presided in that committee; nothing could be further from the intention of the committee themselves, than that the house should sacrifice their integrity for the purpose of maintaining them in an opinion proved to be erroneous. The right hon. gent. had expatiated largely on the conduct of the sheriffs, he only hoped, that if it ever fell to that right hon. gent's lot to have the honour of filling the office of sheriff, he might execute the duties of his situation with as much credit and propriety as the gentlemen who were now the subjects of discussion. After the very luminous speech which the house had heard from the learned counsel at the bar, he should abbreviate what he had to say as much as possible. The hon. gent. here entered into an examination of the report of the committee, and of the evidence on which that report was founded. He asserted, that although there might be 30 or 40 bad qualifications for votes on the part of Sir F. Burdett, there were ten times as many on the other side. The committee had struck out 600 votes indifferently on both sides, because the voters had not been assessed to the land-tax. The papers on the table proved that the sheriffs had refused votes for Sir F. Burdett as well as for Mr. Mainwaring: 128 votes admitted by them for the last-named candidate were struck off by the committee, because they were official, and not freehold votes. Could any circumstance rebut the charge of partiality more strongly than this? He reprobated the conduct of the right hon.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0439"/>
<col>849</col>
gent. in deluging with criminality one of the most immaculate characters that ever existed; he alluded to Mr. Birchall, on whose talents and virtues the shadow of suspicion had never before rested, he praised the conduct of the sheriffs in waiting an hour after the poll had closed, for the purpose of allowing the defeated party to demand a scrutiny. He confessed he was of opinion that no gentleman who had examined the whole of this complicated subject, could conscientiously vote for the motion. The question was not, whether or not the sheriffs should be committed to Newgate, or what should be the quantum of punishment; but whether or not the house would sacrifice their dignity to support a committee evidently in error, so evidently to him, that he firmly believed, if they went back to their room, and reexamined their report they would themselves feel the necessity of correcting it.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01600"><member>Lord Marsham</member><membercontribution> assured the house, that the committee had not determined on the report which they had presented, until after the most mature deliberation. How far they were borne out by the evidence before them, it would be for the house to decide. With regard to himself he could confidently say, that he felt no alteration of opinion on the subject, and he rather thought the other members of the committee adhered as closely to their former decision. His lordship went through the whole of the evidence on the table of the house, reading extracts from it, and commenting upon them as he proceeded, The committee had with regret been under the necessity of striking off votes to both par. ties, in every respect good, but that they had not been assessed to the laud tax. The outrages complained of by the right hon. gent. who opened the debate were unjustifiable, although some exertions had certainly been made by the sheriffs to suppress them. The learned counsel had insisted strongly on the propriety of the sheriffs being tried by the evidence which they had it in their power at the moment to benefit themselves by, and not by that afterwards collected for the Committee. He acknowledged the justness of this observation, and accordingly the committee in their report had withdrawn all that part of the evidence relating to the mill voters, which the sheriffs could not be in possession of at the time of the election. The committee were certainly of opinion, that by acting sometimes judicially and sometimes ministerially, the
<col>850</col>
sheriffs had become culpable. The principal point was certainly that of the mill voters, and to that point, to the question of possession, Mr. Mainwaring's enquiries' were chiefly directed on the 1:5th day of the election. He was convinced, that an undue bias had existed in the minds of the sheriffs, and that at different periods they had pursued different modes of conduct, as it suited their wishes. With regard to the excuse that had been attempted to be set up, of the embarrassments in which the sheriffs found themselves involved in their decisions, he confessed it appeared to him, that a very moderate understanding indeed would have extricated them. Upon the whole he trusted, that the house would feel little difficulty in agreeing with the committee in the resolution which they had submitted to them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01601"><member>The Solicitor General (Sir Vicary Gibbs)</member><membercontribution> did not think it necessary to trouble the house long, when he recollected the mass of evidence which had lain so long on the table, and with which members must by this time have become familiar. He had listened with the utmost attention to the arguments of the learned gent. at the bar, but he owned that he remained entirely unconvinced by them. In considering the merits of the question, the acts of irregularity mentioned by his right hon. friend near him, ought not to be wholly omitted, as they tended distinctly to shew the motives by which the sheriffs had been actuated. The question was, whether or not the sheriffs, with an intention of giving sir F. Burdett an unfair majority, did wilfully and corruptly admit the mill-voters, knowing them at the same time to be bad, and on the 15 day of the poll, towards the close, when the majority turned in favour of sir Francis, rejected votes exactly similar to those they had before accepted. Examine them by their own evidence. They had laid down two rules for their conduct; one, how to acquire information, the other, how to act on such information when acquired. The hon. and learned gent. proved, by an examination of the circumsances of the case, that they either departed from, these rules, or adhered to them as inconvenience dictated. After exposing the' impossibility that the sheriffs should be ignorant of the absurdity of the claims set up by the Isleworth mill-holders to aright of voting, from their possession of a freehold, be commented severely on their conduct with regard to Albion Copper.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0440"/>
<col>851</col>
Satisfied as they must have been, that this man had no right whatever to give his vote on the election, they allowed him to be sent to his oath, that is, to go to certain perjury. The sheriffs had decreed, among their regulations, that no inspector should put a question to a voter but through the medium of a poll clerk; but the right of pulling questions in this way was never questioned until the 14th day of the poll, when Mr. Silvester objected to the first set of mill voters that were brought up, on the ground of joint tenantry, and shortness of possession. On an absurd pretence that the question should not be asked on the hustings, but in the box, they prevented him from making the necessary inquiries, and on his requesting Mr. Mainwaring to do so, sheriff Rawlins in a very rude way, and which was still more reprehensible when Mr. Mainwaring's age wu6 considered, shoved him from the hustings. It should be the object of the returning officer, at every election, to ascertain the truth, if possible; but here the endeavours of the sheriffs were evidently directed to smother it, and they strictly forbade the voters to answer any question, lest they should betray themselves. Nor did these facts depend solely upon the evidence of Mr. Silvester, it was corroborated by that of Mr. Smith, who confirmed it indeed in every particular. The hon. learned gent. entered into a strict investigation of the circumstances attending the last day of the poll, and contended, in opposition to the learned gent. who had been heard at the bar, and who wished to prove, that the conduct of the sheriffs on that day was favourable to Mr. Mainwaring, that their conduct was directly the reverse. On that day all the old whigs, as they were called, voted for sir Burdett. About the middle of the day, when according to the evidence of Mr. Clifford himself, who was sir F. B 's counsel, the election was a hollow thing in his favor; objections were listened to by the sheriffs against a body of mill voters, and for this proceeding they qlaim the praise of candour and impartiality, when in fact, the election being secure, they began to think they had carried the matter top far by the unquestioned admission of these voters, and wished to retrieve their character by an affected severity. The hon. and learned gem. concluded by expressing his hope, that under all these circumstances, the house would feel no. hesitation in agreeing to the report of their committee on this subject.</membercontribution></p>
<col>852</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01602"><member>Mr. W. Smith</member><membercontribution> felt unwilling, after the weighty arguments that had been urged on both sides of the question, to obtrude himself on the attention of the house; but he was desirous to offer some remarks which had escaped the notice of the gentlemen who had already delivered their sentiments on the subject, he most sincerely hoped that no gent. would give his vote on it who had not heard the able speech of the learned counsel at the bar, and who had not studied with attention the documents on the table. He was in some difficulty with regard to the part he should take in the question. He certainly thought, that very considerable blame attached to the sheriffs for their conduct; but he could not allow that their motives were corrupt; and on this point he should feel inclined to differ from the decision of the committee. In his opinion, the right hon. gent. who had commenced the discussion had aggravated the case, by dwelling on circumstances omitted by the committee. The exhibitions to which he alluded were certainly scandalous, but unfortunately in most contested elections, particularly those of Middlesex and Westminster, such outrages were but too frequent. The hon. gent. commented on the evidence of Mr. Adolphus, which, he said, was in some points contradicted by other testimony. He perfectly agreed with the noble lord that the point of most consequence related to the mill voters: had it been his situation, he certainly would not have acted as the sheriffs had done; but it did not follow that they acted corruptly. He thought most of the statements of the learned gent. who had just sat down, irrefragable; there were strong proofs of ill temper and passion, exhibited during the election; he meant only on the part of one of the sherifls, for from this charge Mr. Cone was exonerated. As to the case of Mr. Albion Copper, whom Mr. Silvester had threatened to prosecute, if he had been a wilfully perjured man, would be have been selected as an evidence on behalf of Mr. Mainwaring before the committee? Though he admitted that were was a difference between a solicitor and a barrister at law, yet Mr. Burcball was no common solicitor; and if he ware himself a sheriff, he should trust to his advice as soon as to that of many barristers he could name. He knew not Mr. Burchall personally, nor at all until the present transaction, but from his great experience in the affairs of the county, he thought him as capable of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0441"/>
<col>853</col>
giving sound advice touching an election, as any barrister who might be chosen by the sheriffs. It was a general feeling with gentlemen on a charge of this kind, to have a leaning against the returning officers: but if gentlemen would look into the evidence; they would find, that the sheriffs bad conducted themselves equally and impartially, by adhering firmly to the rules they laid down for their conduct. Though they had acted wrong, he did not think their conduct merited the adoption of any severe resolutions, for it appeared that whatever might have been the riots the poll had never been impeded. He had voted himself, and for the favourite candidate, and was exposed to the abuse of the mob because he appeared without the Colours, though he suffered no violence: If the word corruptly, however, were omitted, he should have no hesitation in agreeing to the report.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01603"><member>Sir. W. W. Wynne</member><membercontribution> agreed completely with the noble lord who had been chairman of the committee. That the sheriffs had acted very improperly no man could' deny. He thought, however, that their1 guilt consisted as much in acts of omission as of commission. Their conduct with respect to the mill voters was highly reprehensible.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01604"><member>Lord Henniker</member><membercontribution> observed, that the hon. gent (Mr. Smith) seemed to be mistaken respecting the power of the magistrates at the election. The power was chiefly vested in the sheriffs on these occasions, and it depended on them to restore order, and keep within due bounds the proceedings of the mob. They, therefore, were answerable for whatever misconduct might have taken place.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01605"><member>Mr. W. Smith</member><membercontribution> explained, by observing that he did not say that it was the business of the magistrates in the first instance to quell the tumult; but only said, that if the conduct of the mob was so gross as it was on some occasions represented, the magistrates might have interfered, and the sheriffs would scarcely have refused their concurrence in such measures.&#x2014;The question was then loudly called for, and strangers were ordered to withdraw. Whilst we were excluded from the gallery, the house agreed to the resolutions of the committee without a division. On our re-admission we found</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01606"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> on his legs, commenting on a motion which had been submitted to the house by Mr. Rose, grounded on the re-
<col>854</col>
port to which they had agreed. The motion was, that the conduct of the sheriffs was in violation of their duty, contrary to law and in breach of the privileges of that house. Mr. Fox was observing, that if they were to rely on the neglect of referring to the land tax assessments, as a gross instance of the violation of law in the conduct of the sheriffs, that ought to be expressed in the motion. It ought to be particularly stated, especially as there was not a single sentence in the resolutions they had agreed to, that warranted-such a charge.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01607"><member>Mr. C. Wynne</member><membercontribution> observed, that it was on all hands agreed that the conduct of the sheriffs had been extremely improper in admitting the Mill votes; but there was a doubt entertained1 whether they had acted corruptly, and not rather from neglect Or inattention. This might be discovered by a reference to other parts of their conduct. The under sheriff's opinion relative to a reference to the land-tax assessments, seemed to be formed on a supposition that the act of parliament was absurd, he thought that the house should follow up its adoption of the resolutions of the committee, with some other proceedings, for the sake of asserting the right of electors, as well as the privileges of the house; and he had only to regret the length of time that it had been delayed.&#x2014;The question was then put on the motion, when</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01608"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer,</member><membercontribution> in order to obviate the argument of the hon. gent. opposite (Mr. Fox), thought, that, as the most striking breach of law that had been committed by the sheriffs, was their having admitted the votes of persons who were not to be found in the assessments to the land tax, the words "as well as by refusing to refer to the assessments to the land tax," should be inserted in the motion. As this formed part of the guilt of the sheriffs, it ought to be expressed in the resolution of the house, especially as it had been attempted by some persons to define the duty of the sheriffs, otherwise than as the law directed. This would be a security that no sheriffs hereafter would act as those sheriffs had done in the instance under consideration.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01609"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> thought that the greatest breach of law committed by the sheriffs, was their having omitted to conform to the injunctions of an act of parliament which no man could deny to be highly improper. As the committee had made
<image src="S1V0003P0I0442"/>
<col>855</col>
no report on the subject, it was not unlikely that the committee saw reasons for the omission. The fact was, he believed, that the same conduct had taken place uniformly at every election for Middlesex, and that the reference to the land tax, assessments, for many elections past, had been reserved for the scrutiny; but this fact the committee were best acquainted with.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01610"><member>Lord Marsham</member><membercontribution> had some doubt whether the amendment proposed by the right hon. gent. could be agreed to consistently with the report. The evidence, as well as he could recollect, did not prove that the sheriffs refused the reference, but that they would not stop the poll for it; and they certainly bad not facilitated, the reference to the assessments, which was left to be made in the particular booths.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01611"><member>The Attorney General</member><membercontribution> proved from a passage in the evidence given by Mr. Adolpbus, that the sheriffs had declared it not to be their duty to examine the books of assessments, and had refused to refer to them, and he therefore supported the amendment.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01612"><member>Mr. W. Smith</member><membercontribution> said he had already stated what he now begged to repeat, that the evidence of Mr. Adolphus ought not to be considered as conclusive by the house.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01613"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> also cited some passages from the evidence, to shew that the sheriffs had not attended to a request on the part of Mr. Mainwaring, that they might refer to the assessments of the land tax. The house agreed to the amended motion; "That the said R. A. Cox, and sir W. Rawlins, knt. by then conduct and practices at the said election, as stated in the foregoing resolutions, as well as by refusing to refer to the assessments to the land tax, have acted in violation of their duty, contrary to law, and in breach of the privilege's of that house."&#x2014;It was then ordered, on the motion of Mr. Rose, "That the said R. A. Cox, and Sir W. Rawlins, knt. for their said offence, be committed to his majesty's gaol of Newgate, and that the speaker do issue his warrant accordingly."&#x2014;Adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

ward at the commencement of the session against Judge Fox, the tendency of which was, that they should be referred to the committee of the. Lords to whom the petitions of Mr. Hart and others, against the hon. judge, had been referred.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01615"><member>Lord Auckland</member><membercontribution> expressed his regret that the subject had been ever brought forward before their lordships in the shape in which it appeared to stand; but now that they had taken it into, consideration, he thought it incumbent on them to proceed to a conclusion, and either to acquit or convict the learned and hon. gent. whose conduct was the subject of the charges or accusations, or whatever, other names were given to them. He sincerely lamented that such a precedent had been established, as that one of the judges of the land should be called upon to answer the allegations of any member of that house, however respectable, and particularly as the matter of those allegations was not within the immediate knowledge of that noble lord, but taken upon the bare assertion of those whose authority should be received with some diffidence. If it were competent to the noble marquis to do this, by parity of reasoning, any of the 658 members of the other house might call upon any of the judges, or even the lord chancellor, to answer to charges which, perhaps, might ultimately prove to be unfounded. What a situation, therefore, would that of those persons, chosen on account of their experience, ability, and virtue, to administer the laws, be, if, on the solitary allegation of any of the members of the other house, or of any noble lord out of the 360 of which the peerage consisted, they should be required to answer at that bar accusations of the most serious nature. However as their lordships had proceeded so far, he thought it their duty to continue, notwithstanding the objections to which their proceedings may give rise.</membercontribution></p>

The other house might have proceeded by impeachment, and he was sorry that mode had not been resorted to; but still it was competent to either house to proceed by address. His lordship explained the anomalous proceedings, in which it was possible the present measure might lead their lordships, and, slated more explicitly than what had been pre-

<p id="S1V0003P0-01618"><member>Lord Hawkesbury</member><membercontribution> adverted to the novelty of the case, and urged the necessity of proceeding with extreme caution and precision in a case for which there was no precedent.</membercontribution></p>

He thought it a subject for deep regret, that an occasion for any measure of the sort upon which they were engaged should have occurred; and he particularly lamented, that the mode of impeachment had not been preferred to one which was likely to involve them in a sea of eternal discussion, where they would have to labour without rudder or guide. The honour, the character, and the fame of one who filled the most important office in the magistracy, should not be subjected to the delays and inconveniences inseparable from the mode of proceeding, into which the house had unfortunately fallen. His lordship's amendment was then read and adopted, which was in substance" that so much of the allegations against the hon.

<title>[MUTINY BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01620">On the order of the day being read for the third reading of the mutiny bill, the bill was read accordingly; after which,</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01621"><member>The Secretary at War</member><membercontribution> brought up a clause by way of rider, which contained the oath to be in future administered to all members serving on regimental courts martial, and also another for swearing all the witnesses who should give evidence before them.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01622"><member>General Fitzpatrick</member><membercontribution> then rose, and, after adverting to his proposal on a former day, that no person should be permitted to sit as president on a regimental court mar-
<col>858</col>
tial who bad not attained the age of 21 years, said, that if be thought it could have the slightest tendency to weaken the discipline of the army, he would be the last man who should think of proposing it. He did not say, that the usual punishments inflicted were more severe than necessary, for which reason, the clause he should recommend, would, in its effects, rather serve to strengthen the powers of regimental courts martial. As it must, however, be confessed that the punishments were at times extremely rigid, the greater attention should be paid to have them carefully administered. If the same gravity and dignity were infused into these regimental, that always accompanied general courts martial, the men, finding the same impartial trial in the one, as in the other, would be naturally led to a more cheerful compliance with their decisions. He maintained that the powers given to regimental courts martial went beyond the object for which they were originally established, which the act itself stated to be for the trial of small offences, which words certainly must imply that they would be limited to the infliction of small punishments. They were never designed to try mutiny, desertion, thefts, and those other serious charges which, were now brought before them; and though in usage the intention of the act had been prevented, yet if it had been foreseen that such causes would have been brought before them, there could be no doubt that they would have been subjected to the same solemnities of oaths as in general courts martial. To his proposal he never had heard any other objection made than the general one, that it would be an innovation in the service; but the same argument was applicable to any improvement that could be offered, and would have formerly applied with equal force against the bill itself. As the object of administering oaths was acceded to by the secretary at war, what remained for him to submit was, that the presidents on such courts should not be under the age of 21 years. He proposed it on the same principle on which it was required, that none should preside in general courts martial who were not of the rank of field officers, the object of which was, to provide that the presidents should be persons of a competent experience. It might, indeed, be said, that the presidents of regimental courts martial were required to be of the rank of captains, and that if a man was
<image src="S1V0003P0I0444"/>
<col>859</col>
not fit for Such a president, he could not be fit to command a company. In answer to this, he would declare it as his opinion, that it would be a good and salutary measure, if captains were required to be of the age of 21 years. He thought the genius and talents of some young men would offer an exception to this regulation, but, as a general rule, he thought it might have very favourable consequences as to the service. On the present occasion, however, he would not submit any other alteration than the one he proposed, especially as military regulations in general more properly belonged to the prerogative of the crown. He then proposed; as an amendment to the first clause, that after the. words that "no man under the rank of captain," should be added the words, "and had attained the age of 21 years."</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01623"><member>Sir James Pulteney</member><membercontribution> opposed the clause on the grounds that the long-established practice in the army ought not to be altered without the maturest deliberation.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01624"><member>The Secretary at War</member><membercontribution> defended the clause on the grounds that an innovation had been made by the regimental courts martial taking cognizance of higher crimes under different names. It was time, therefore, that the evidence against the soldier should be examined with the solemnity of an oath, that the punishment for perjury might follow close upon falsehood. He had consulted several general officers, who were for the most part against the clause, but they had alleged no sufficient reasons. He could not agree to have none as president of a court martial who was not 21 years of age, on account of the inconvenience which it would produce.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01625"><member>Earl Temple</member><membercontribution> was against the oath being administered, where the person who swore falsely was not liable to the penalties of perjury, as must be the case in a regimental court martial, which was not a court of record like a general court martial.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01626"><member>Mr. S. Bourne</member><membercontribution> said, that persons perjuring themselves before a regimental court martial, should be made liable to all its penalties.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01627"><member>Sir Eyre Coote</member><membercontribution> defended the clause, because it gave greater solemnity to courts martial. The object was the discovery of truth, and how could truth be more effectually discovered than by putting the witnessess on oath?</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01628"><member>Mr. Fuller</member><membercontribution> was against the clause, as tending unnecessarily to multiply oaths.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01629"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> agreed
<col>860</col>
in the propriety of the clause, though he regretted that he differed in opinion from so many able officers. He could not conceive how the oath could be prejudicial. The discretion of the officer was the same, and the evidence would be the same. He agreed, that if the practices of the courts Of law, with respect to evidence, was to be followed, it might be dangerous. He a greed to this clause, because it was just in itself, and not because there was any complaint.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01630"><member>Lord De Blaquiere</member><membercontribution> said, wanted no innovation in the system, but to have things brought back to their original institution, to confine the jurisdiction of regimental courts-martial to trifling offences, instead, of trying, as they do now, offences of mutiny, desertion, &amp;c. under names that did not belong to them. He wished to have limited also the quantum of the punishment they should be entitled to inflict, for he had seen a man sentenced by a regimental Court-martial to receive one thousand strokes, for an offence, which, on board a ship, would not have been punished with more than a dozen lashes. At the same time, he confessed that he did not like to hear the solemnity of an oath should be resorted to in every trivial charge of drunken frolic, or being late on the parade.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01631"><member>Sir W. W. Wynne</member><membercontribution> in reference to one of the observations of the chancellor of the exchequer, said, that in the militia, he knew of many captains in regiments, who were neither 21 years of age, and had not been so much as two years in the service.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01632"><member>Colonel Franklund</member><membercontribution> spoke very warmly against the bill, as likely to breed great dissentions, and promote disputes and unhappiness amongst the men, who would be thus encouraged to threaten their comrades with indictments for perjury if they gave evidence unfavourable to the accused. The practice which the clause went to abolish had prevailed for time immemorial, and without any complaint against it, from the reign of W. HI. down to the present moment, though the mutiny bill was brought every year before the eyes of parliament. This was merely a question of speculative good, offered to practical experience, for which reason he would give it his decided negative.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01633"><member>Colonel Stewart</member><membercontribution> said, he could not oppose the clauses, on account of the manner in which regimental courts martial proceeded, as they were now constituted. He

Slated, that it was usual for the president to take short notes of the most material parts of the evidence, while the other members of the court were chatting, or perhaps amusing themselves with writing or drawing on the slips of paper before them. In his opinion, these courts martial should always be composed of either 5 or 7 officers.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01634"><member>General Stewart</member><membercontribution> said, he was anxious that on account of the similarity of their names, his opinion should not be confounded with that of the hon. officer who spoke before him, and whose proposal, of placing 6 or 7 officers in these courts martial would be impracticable in places where troops were detached, sometimes at the distance of one hundred miles asunder.&#x2014;After a few words from General Fitzpatrick, the first clause was agreed to, and added to the bill; and, on the question being put on the second clause authorizing the administering of oaths as to the witnesses,</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01635"><member>Sir J.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01636"><member>Sir J.

Both the clauses being added to the bill, it immediately passed, and was ordered to the lords.</membercontribution></p>

<title>[AGRICULTURAL HORSE DUTY BILL.]</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01637">On the order of the day being moved for the 2nd reading of this bill,</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01638"><member>Mr. Plumer</member><membercontribution> rose to object to it; his reason for doing so was, that the duty bore, with a very extraordinary degree of pressure, on the farmer; and, consquently, in the end, on the landed interest. The farmers of this country, he said, were by no means that very opulent class of men they had been falsely represented to be, and he was well convinced, the times were better
<col>862</col>
for the farmer, when corn sold at 8s. or 9s. per bushel, than in those in which it had reached the very high prices, at which it had been in the course of a few years last past. He had been told, that this tax would, as taxes generally do, fall on the consumer, but who, be asked, are the consumers? The answer is very direct said he; those who eat bread: as such, it must fall with the greatest weight on the lower and poorer orders of the community, and therefore he was averse from it. A committee above stai<ob/>s had, in the course of last session, been a long time employed to enquire into the most effectual means of reducing the price corn, and, consequently, of bread, and the result of that inquiry was, that it would be necessary to take every possible step towards the improvement of agriculture. The present tax, he was convinced, would very materially impede the interests of agriculture, and there fore he was against it. He did not say this from any captious opposition to taxes, but from a thorough conviction, in his own mind, that he was strongly impelled by his duty to make the observations he had done.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01639"><member>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</member><membercontribution> said, he really thought the bill would not produce the pressure which some gentlemen apprehended, He believed the tax would fall on the consumer; and the increase it, would create in the price of the article of corn would amount to a sum so trifling, that no one could think it any inconvenience to any body. The whole of the duty was estimated at 300,000l. one-third of which would be borne by those who kept horses for trades in large towns, brewers and the like, so that the whole amount of the duty on husbandry was only 200,000l. The amount of the rental of England alone was 37 millions; including Scotland, it was 40 millions. The produce of land had been calculated under the mark many years ago, and since which great improvements had been made; in no case was it calculated at less than 3 tines the rent; in many it was 5 and 6 times that amount; but taking it moderately, at 4 times the rent, the annual produce would then be 100 sterling. Now, this duty was only one 7 50th part of that produce on the whole average of the kingdom; and taking the bill in the most objectionable shape in which gentlemen chose to put it, that was, distinguishing the arable from pasture land, and taking it to be more on the arable than on the pasture, it would then be the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0446"/>
<col>863</col>
1,000th part of the produce of the pasturage, one 500th on the arable land, and this, computing one quarter of corn to each individual in the kingdom in the year, would amount only to an additional charge of 1&#x00BD; per annum, a sum, he apprehended, not so alarming, nor any thing, likely to check the growth of corn.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01640"><member>Mr. Coke (of Norfolk)</member><membercontribution> said, he was perfeetly convinced the operation of it would be to take away all inclination to agricultural improvements. There were at this moment fewer horses employed than when the last tax took place, and there could not be a doubt but that, from this additional tax, the number would continue to decrease, which must of course prove an injury to the general interests of agriculture. It would prevent the bringing of marle from any considerable distance, and render the carriage of every kind of manure more difficult and tedious, from the decrease in the number of horses. He was thoroughly satisfied, that if the tax took place, the same quantity of corn would not be grown as had been heretofore, which must prove highly injurious to the country, and contribute to enhance the price of bread. It was, he said, an old, and he believed, a true saying, that when poverty once gets into the stable, it will not be long before it makes its way into the house. He warned the right hon. gent. that the farmer might be induced, in many places, to substitute oxen to perform the offices of agriculture. In every part of a country like this, there would be always a prevalence of local prejudices; he could wish they were not so common. In Norfolk, where farming was carried to a great degree of nicety, he believed there was no such thing known as the use of oxen in husbandry, but it was otherwise in many other counties, and might be brought into far more general use in those counties where there was more grazing land. If the farmer did not receive a fair remuneration, there could be no doubt his corn would grow less. From all these considerations, therefore, he should certainly vote against the motion.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01641"><member>Sir W. W. Wynne</member><membercontribution> argued that the present tax would bear heavily, in particular on the holders of mountainous farms, where six horses are sometimes required to do work which two could perform in a low flat country. He hoped also that there would be an exemption, if the bill were persevered in, of horses under 14&#x00BD; hands high.</membercontribution></p>
<col>864</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01642"><member>Mr. Fox</member><membercontribution> said, that although farms of 20l. a year were exempt, yet thousands of small farms were now subject to the tax, and ought to be relieved from its pressure.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01643"><member>Mr. Giles</member><membercontribution> opposed it as immediately pressing hard on agriculture, and would not soon fail to fall on the consnmer. He had, however, one objection to the tax entirely, and that was, a breach of faith with the farmers. They were only to be taxed three-fourths of their rents, which was an estimation of his profits, and you cannot lay a direct tax on the profits of the farmer without making an alteration in his property tax; for if you lay a tax on him, you diminish his profits, which cannot be done without a breach of faith.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01644"><member>Mr. Canning</member><membercontribution> contended that the arguments of the hon. gent. who spoke last, proved too much, and therefore ought not to weigh in the consideration of a measure of this nature.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01645"><member>Mr. Grey</member><membercontribution> said, that he agreed with all his hon. friends, that a more injurious tax could not be proposed. If we are to bear additional burdens, that cannot be done without attending to the principal resources of the country. He was doubtful as to the real policy of the corn bill, but sure he was, in his own mind, that the less parliament interfered in matter of that kind, the better. In every view of it, he thought there could not be a more impolitic tax than the present, for it would operate as a discouragement to agriculture, and consequently prove highly injurious to the country.&#x2014;After this a desultory conversation took place: Sir R. Buxton, Mr. Bastard, and Mr. Fellows, opposed the Bill; the Attorney General and Mr. Huskisson supported it; after which the house divided: For the second reading 73&#x2014;Against it 76&#x2014;Majority against the Bill 3.</membercontribution></p>

The increase would be proportionate to the present rate of duty in that country and here.

After a short conversation the house divided: For the second, reading 92&#x2014;Against it 54&#x2014;Majority 38.&#x2014;The bill was then read a second time, and ordered to be committed,&#x2014;Adjourned.</membercontribution></p>

<title>PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01648">THE FIRST REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONERS OF NAVAL ENQUIRY, APPOINTED BY ACT 43 GEO. III.&#x2014;<i>Ordered to be printed</i> 12<i>th May,</i> 1803.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01649">NAVAL STOREKEEPERS AT JAMAICA.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01650">The First Report of the Commissioners appointed by an Act of the 43rd Year of the Reign of His present Majesty, intituled, "An Act for appointing Commissioners to enquire and examine into any Irregularities, Frauds, or Abuses, which are or have been practised by Persons employed in the several Naval Departments therein mentioned, and in the Business of Prize Agency, and to report such Observations as shall occur to them for preventing such Irregularities, Frauds, and Abuses, and for the better conducting and managing the Business of the said Departments, and of Prize Agency in future."</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01651">THE Act of Parliament having passed, by which we were constituted commissioners to enquire and examine into any irregularities, frauds, or abuses which are, or have been practised by persons employed in the several naval departments therein mentioned, and in the business of prize agency; we immediately took the oath prescribed, and after settling the necessary arrangements of office, proceeded without delay to the execution of the duties imposed on us by the act.&#x2014;To enable us more readily to fulfil the intentions of the legislature, we required the right hon. the lords commissioners of the admiralty to lay before us any information they had collected relative to the objects of our enquiry. In compliance with this requisition, we received from their lordships the examinations and minutes taken on their late visitation to the Dock Yards, with copies of their correspondence with the
<col>866</col>
Navy and Victualling Boards, and a variety of other papers and letters relative to the abuses they had discovered, and the alterations and amendments they had established in the several departments, which we think will be attended with much advantage to the public service. We also called upon the other boards, for a general account of Imprests Outstanding; of bills drawn upon them by their agents abroad, and other statements, which appeared necessary to our future investigations, and would take a considerable time in the preparation.&#x2014;The conduct of the Naval Storekeepers abroad, more especially in regard to the mode of their taking up money for the public service, and the rates of exchange at which they credited government in their accounts; together with the purchases of stores made by them, appeared to us subjects, to which our enquiries might be advantageously directed, it being apprehended that considerable abuses had been practised in these transactions.&#x2014;The commissioners appointed by act of parliament to enquire into the Fees, Gratuities, Perquisites, and Emoluments of the several Public Offices, and also into the Abuses that may exist in the same, thought proper, after examining the establishment and conduct of the officers at home, to make a separate report, under the head of "Naval and Victualling Departments, "at foreign and distant ports."&#x2014;In this report they exhibit several instances of frauds and abuses, committed abroad; and after pointing out some cases, in which a sufficient superintending power was not established, and intimating that in others, this power had been wholly neglected, or its operation corruptly withheld, they recommended many improvements in the system; some of which have been adopted: but that others more effectual are required, we have occasion to observe, from the result of an examination into a case laid before us, and which we now proceed to make the subject of the present report.&#x2014;Before we enter in-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0448"/>
<col>867</col>
to the detail of the case, it may be useful to state, that the duties of naval storekeepers on the foreign stations, are contained in a book of instructions of ancient date, to which additions have from time to time been made, and from which the following article, containing directions for their conduct in procuring money for their bills of exchange, and in making purchases of stores, is extracted: viz. "Article 13th. The naval "officer is in all purchases of stores also to lake for vouchers the tradesmen's bills, expressing the dimensions, length, size, quantity, rates, and value of each article, and containing their receipt for the money, attested by two witnesses, of which the master shipwright, or master attendant, is to be one. These the naval officer shall charge himself with, as in other cases; and for them, and all other disbursements, shall draw bills on the navy board, at the best exchange; for which you shall advertise, and take the highest rate; which shall be approved of, and countersigned by the commissioner, or where none, the commanding officer, and certified at the foot by the master shipwright and master attendant, that the same was necessarily drawn, that the stores were wanted, and were delivered in, good and fit for the service. If these attestations be not made, and the vouchers not transmitted within 3 months, the bills will not be paid. And the naval officer is to charge himself not only with the sterling amount of the bills so drawn, but with their amount also in currency; and that the navy board may know that there is no undue advantage made of the various rates of exchange, the total of every account shall be both in currency and sterling; and the cash accounts and vouchers shall contain the then rate of exchange. And at the end of every year, you shall transmit an account containing the rate of exchange in every month throughout the year, certified by two principal merchants, and approved by the commissioner (if one.) You shall in like manner mark, in currency and sterling, all monies received from the sale of old stores, or otherwise. In general, no bills will be paid that are not drawn agreeably to these regulations. And when the naval officer presents bills to the commissioner, &amp;c. for his approbation, he shall submit to his inspection, his balance of cash in hand; and in transmitting an account to the navy board of bills drawn, he shall send
<col>868</col>
the amount of the balance then remaining in his hands. The rate of exchange shall be certified by some of the principal merchants of the place, and the public shall constantly have the benefit of the exchange. If the postmaster, collector of the customs, or other public officer, can occasionally supply money for bills, it shall be transacted in the usual manner, and at the proper rate of exchange. The bills drawn in the course of the year shall be numbered in succession, and no two bills shall be drawn for the same exact sum the same day. At the end of the year a list of all bills drawn within it, shall be transmitted."&#x2014;We also think it necessary to give some short account of the currency and exchange between this country and the West Indies. In the several West India islands there is a respective currency or valuation of money established, the fixed proportional value of which, to the money of this country constitutes the par, or current exchange. It does not, however, determine the actual rate of exchange, for that fluctuates from the same causes which affect the exchange between other countries. In Antigua and the other islands, with the exception of Jamaica, the custom that prevails in drawing bills, is, to add the premium when the exchange is above par, expressing them both in one sum; and in the same manner reducing the amount when the exchange is at a discount or below par.&#x2014;At Jamaica, instead of this plain and direct mode of operation, nothing appears in the bills drawn from thence, but the exchange of 140l. (40l. per cent. being the difference between the currency of that island and the money of this country) leaving the premium or discount which constitutes the actual rate of exchange, to be separately charged in the accounts current between the parties.&#x2014;By the examination of W. Nettleshipp, esq. accountant to the Board of Ordnance, we learned, that the subject of premium on bills of exchange, was brought under the cognizance of that board in the year 1786; and that since the year 1789, it has been invariably accounted for by their agents at Jamaica. How it so long escaped the observation of the Navy Board, we are at a loss to understand, especially as we find from the accounts of bills drawn from the different stations abroad, that at Halifax, although the same practice, prevails of drawing bills at par, as at Jamaica, yet a premium has been regularly given credit for, or discount charged on the bills drawn from thence.&#x2014;
<image src="S1V0003P0I0449"/>
<col>869</col>
Understanding that this subject had been represented to the Navy Board, and that Mr. W. Smith, who was naval storekeeper at Jamaica at the commencement of the war, had been dismissed from his situation, for persisting in the practice of not giving government credit for the premium on his bills, after the directions he had received for that purpose, we required from the Navy Board a copy of the correspondence which led to the dismissal of Mr. Smith, and the order given thereupon, and of any directions to, or correspondence which might have passed with his successors, as to the appropriation of the premium on their bills.&#x2014;By this correspondence it appears, that on the 14th July 1795, rear admiral William Parker, then commander in chief at Jamaica, represented to the Navy Board, the conduct of the naval storekeeper, in acting so contrary to his instructions, in the mode of taking up money; and stated his unauthorized gain, and the consequent loss to government, to be then 15 per cent. that being the premium which the rear admiral had received upon the amount of his own private bills.&#x2014;Upon this representation, the Navy Board, by warrant dated the 4th Sept. 1795, remind Mr. Smith of his instructions, and require a compliance therewith, in the mode of taking up money; and by directions from the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, call upon him for an account current of the sums he had received, by exchange for bills drawn upon them, and the amount of the sums he had paid when the exchange had not been in favour of the drawer; clearly evincing by such warrant, that they considered their instructions to apply to the premium, as they did not make any specific mention of it, although rear admiral Parker had so designated 4he advantage of the exchange in his representation.&#x2014;To neither of these directions Mr. Smith paid any attention; and persevering in the practice of drawing bills at par, without giving the public the benefit of the exchange, he was, particularly on that account, as well as for other irregularities, dismissed from his office by the lords commissioners of the Admiralty, at the instance of the Navy Board; and his conduct was judged so reprehensible, that order were sent out to the commander in chief to supersede him immediately, and to appoint a person to act in his place until his successor might arrive. The person appointed was Mr. Henry Broughton, the chief clerk in the office; and during his continuance in that situation, he drew upon the Navy Board
<col>870</col>
for the sum of 37,000l. on which sum no premium has been carried to account.&#x2014;On the 8th July 1796, Mr. James Dick was appointed naval storekeeper at Jamaica, and took charge of his office on the 1st Feb. 1797. At the time of his appointment, he received from the Navy Board a copy of the printed instructions, usually given to naval storekeepers, without any specific directions as to he appropriation of the premium on his bills.&#x2014;Mr. William Smith, the former naval storekeeper, returned to England soon after Mr. Dick's arrival at Jamaica; but we do not find, that the order, requiring an account if his premium or discount, was enforced, or any further proceedings had, regarding he bills drawn by him without the signature of the commander in chief, which had been directed by the Admiralty to be paid, east government should suffer in its credit: and his accounts, notwithstanding his failure in a compliance with this order, and his neglect in carrying to account the premium on his bills, even after the directions of the navy board for that purpose, have all been finally massed without further notice; and the security bond, which he entered into for 2000l. with two sureties, has also been given up. It has been stated to us, that accounts though passed, are open to revision, and the party concerned liable to answer for any frauds or irregularities; but we conceive a public board would appear with an ill grace, in any suit instituted for the recovery of money, after the accounts had been finally passed, the bond of the party returned, and his sureties released. In the case above alluded to, such suit would now be fruitless, from the subsequent insolvency of Mr. Smith.&#x2014;Although it does not appear that Mr. Dick had any public admonition or information given to him, as to the misconduct of his predecessor, which we cannot but think might have been proper; yet, as he had recourse to books at the navy office, from which he might have gained that information, although, in his evidence, he alledges that he searched those books merely for the purpose of discovering whether his salary commenced from the day of his appointment, or from the time of his taking possession of the office; we cannot for a moment doubt, but that he was perfectly acquainted with the causes of his predecessor's dismission, and that the strange manner in which he acted with regard to. the papers of his office, on his arrival at Jamaica, if truly stated by him, was designedly to lay ground for a plea of ignorance, in case his possession of the navy
<image src="S1V0003P0I0450"/>
<col>871</col>
board's warrant, of the 4th Sept. 1795, on the subject of the exchange, should be afterwards brought in question. Lord Hugh Seymour, in his letter of 21st Dec. 1800, states his conviction, that that warrant was received and suppressed; and the examination of Mr. W. Smith, late naval storekeeper at Jamaica, now confined for debt in the Fleet prison, confirms the fact of its having been received.&#x2014;The Navy Board, in their letter to the officers of Jamaica Yard of 14th Sept. 1797, very properly enquire, whether the accounts and papers of the office had been delivered over to Mr. Dick? We lament, that on the receipt of their answer of 20th Dec. 1797, this enquiry was not followed up, by ascertaining what papers were received by him, and particularly whether the warrant of 4th Sept. 1795, respecting the taking up money, was not amongst them: this would have cut off all subterfuge, and saved much future discussion; though we do not think it essential in the consideration of the conduct, which a public servant, with such minute and particular instructions before him, ought to have pursued. Mr. Dick deposes, in his very extraordinary evidence, that where the practice of office and the instructions were at variance, he followed the former; and the reasons for his having done so, are sufficiently obvious; such conduct, however, cannot be too strongly reprobated.&#x2014;Notwithstanding the late striking instance of neglect in Mr. Smith, the correspondence that look place on the subject, and his consequent dismission, yet, from the time of Mr. Dick's appointment in July 1796, to the 18th Sept. 1800, the cash accounts continued to be transmitted from Jamaica without any alteration in form, or credit being given for the premium on bills of exchange, or any enquiry on the part of the Navy Board, why it was not done.&#x2014;On the 18th of Sept. 1800, a letter was written by the Navy Board to vice admiral lord Hugh Seymour, referring to rear admiral Parker's letter in 1795, observing that Mr. Dick had not brought the premium on his bills to account, and remarking, that though it had been the practice of naval store-keepers to stand to the risk in the fluctuation of the premium and discount on their bills, they thought that this had been done away by their warrant of the 4th of Sept. 1795. A warrant to the same effect as the letter to lord Hugh Seymour, was written to Mr. Dick; staling further, that they will not at present determine on the appropriation of the money he had received, but requiring him to obey his instructions in futures;
<col>872</col>
and charging him with not supplying the post office with bills on the application of the deputy postmaster general, to enable him to make his remittances, without being obliged to purchase private bills at a risk as well as loss by the exchange.&#x2014;From the time that this order was communicated by lord Hugh Seymour to Mr. Dick, he of necessity brought the premium to the public credit in his monthly cash accounts; but he soon after resigned the office and returned to England.&#x2014;In order to ascertain, with as much precision as the case would admit, to what extent the public had suffered, during the late war, by not receiving the benefit of the exchange, we called upon George Hibbert, Thomas Hughan, Robert Millegan, Alexander Henry, and John Willis, esquires, merchants of eminence, having connexion with the island of Jamaica, fully qualified to give us information on that subject; and we also requested of the Board of Ordnance to furnish us with the rates of premium brought to account during this period by their officers at Jamaica.&#x2014;It appears from the Accounts of Bills which has been laid before us from the 1st of Jan. 1793, to the 31st of Dec. 1800, between which periods the premiums were not carried to account, that the Naval Storekeepers at Jamaica drew upon the Navy Board for 536,258l 2s. 6d. sterling: and from the best evidence we have been able to obtain, the premium during that time, upon a low average, amounted to 10l. per cent. and consequently the public have lost the sum of 53,625l. 16s. 3d.&#x2014;The bills drawn by Mr. Dick, upon which he did not account to government for the premium, amounted to 364,000l.; therefore, by the above average of 10l. per cent. the public have sustained a loss of 36,400l. thereon; but, had we confined the average to the rate of premium whilst he was in office, the loss might fairly have been calculated at a greater sum.&#x2014;From the instructions given to commanders in chief, by the Admiralty, we find it to be a part of their duty to approve all bills drawn by Naval Storekeepers, if satisfied that the money has been procured at the best rate of exchange; yet it appears that Mr. James Dick gave to the commander in chief, bills to the amount of 45,000l. without charging him any premium, though at that period the rate of exchange was high. On Mr. Dick's being questioned to this point, notwithstanding he had in a previous part of his examination informed us that he considered the premium on his bills as his property, yet, in reply he said, that, "he
<image src="S1V0003P0I0451"/>

thought the commander in chief, when he wanted public bills to remit his prize money to England, had as good a right to them as he had;" but as Mr. Dick neither possessed a right to lake himself or give up to any other what belonged to government, we see no reason for deducting from the charge against him the premium on these bills, which he ought to have received, and brought to account; and we observe, by the evidence of rear admiral Bligh, that Mr. Dick proposed to give him bills without receiving any premium, which he declined accepting, alledging as a reason for his refusal, that if it belonged to government, he should have to pay it hereafter, and if it was the fair emolument of Mr. Dick, he had no right to deprive him of it. The rear admiral thinks that Mr. Dick did not say, whether it was his perquisite, or the property of government, but that he; had written on the subject, and had received no answer. Rear Admiral Bligh therefore insisted on paying, and did actually pay to him 15 per cent. premium on 4,000l.; which circumstances strongly prove, that Mr. Dick did not at that time consider, as he has stated to ns in his evidence, the premium on his bills to be his property, oral fair perquisite of his office.&#x2014;In order to acquire every possible information relating to these transactions, we thought it proper to call upon the Comptroller and other members of the Navy Board; by some of whom it is stated, that owing to the multiplicity of business, the subject of the premium on bills of exchange drawn at Jamaica, had been wholly lost sight of till Sept. 1800, since which period, the premiums have been carried to account; but it appears that no measures were taken for the recovery of what had been previously received by the Naval Storekeepers, until it became a subject of our enquiry. We now understand that a suit has been instituted against Mr. Dick.&#x2014;We have hitherto confined our observations on one part of the subject only, the abuses committed in the drawing of bills of exchange for money taken up for the use of the naval department at Jamaica: the abuses in the expenditure of this money, and the wilful neglects in not sending timely demands for stores, by which a necessity for such large disbursements was created, though abuses not so easily detected, or precisely substantiated, are of infinitely more consequence; indeed, it is chiefly from this source, that the occasion of drawing bills, and the consequent great profit by the exchange, took its rise.&#x2014;The irregularity of
<col>874</col>
Mr. Dick in the transmission of his accounts of stores expended and remaining, and of the demands for the probable exigencies of the service, and also in the mode of making purchases, appear in a very voluminous correspondence between the commanders in chief on the Jamaica station, the Navy Board, and Mr. Dick (which we caused to be laid before us) as well as from the examination of two of the members, and the secretary of the committee of stores: whose evidence, with a letter from the Navy Board to vice admiral lord Hugh Seymour, we conceive fully sufficient to establish the fact of Mr. Dick's misconduct in these particulars; in which he persevered, notwithstanding the severe reprimands which lie received, until it was convenient to himself to relinquish his appointment.&#x2014;By the omission of the Naval Storekeeper to transmit his demands regularly, the Navy Board was left unacquainted with the stores necessary to be forwarded to that station; and although some supplies were sent out, anticipating the probable wants, yet they were not sufficient to prevent the necessity his neglect had created, for making large purchases at an enormous expence, as the fleet was obliged to be furnished with such stores as they stood in need of, at any rate.&#x2014;Another evil attended this mode of procuring supplies: vice admiral sir Hyde Parker states, in his letter of the 9th Feb. 1799, that the stores were not only bought at exorbitant prices, but were of very inferior quality; indeed the inferiority of cordage and other naval stores procurable in this way, when compared to those supplied by government, is a fact too notorious to require any evidence,&#x2014;In order to shew how much the public has lost by these purchases, we have selected those made by Mr. Dick in the months of Jan. and Feb. 1800, not because the prices were more disadvantageous to government in those months, but because in that year the greatest purchases were made, and it is the year in which the necessity for making them appears more particularly attributable to his neglect; and in another column, we have placed the prices paid by government for the like articles in England, as staled to us by the Navy Board, to which, if there be added 15 per cent. for freight, and other charges, being the amount allowed for that purpose in the instructions to foreign officers, the difference will shew the loss which government may be supposed to have suffered in these months, amounting to 27,896l. 3s. 3d.</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01654">Supposing an equal difference to have prevailed between the prices at home and abroad, during the period of Mr. Dick's holding his office, the whole amount of the loss to government would have been 134,557l. 18s. 2d. st. on his purchases.&#x2014;Cordage, the most considerable article in the storekeeper's purchases, appears, by the documents laid before us, to have been bought by Mr. Dick in Oct. and Nov. 1799, at the rate of 216l. st. per ton, which would have cost in England at that time 53l. 3s. 4d. but we have rather chosen to rest our conclusions on this subject, upon his account of purchases of a variety of articles, made in the course of 2 months, as extracted from his cash accounts.</p>
<col>876</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01655">But it is not to be supposed, that, with every care in the transmission of his accounts and demands, and equal attention in forwarding the supplies, all necessity for purchasing stores could have been prevented; allowing therefore &#x00BC;, or even &#x2153; part, to be deducted from his account, there would still remain a sum of very great magnitude, enough to shew the nature and extent of the loss to which government has been in this instance subjected, and is always liable to suffer, by such practices.&#x2014;We have investigated this instance of abuse, as far as it laid in our power, more minutely perhaps than was requisite, for the purpose of displaying it in such a form, as to prove the truth of its ex-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0453"/>
<col>877</col>
istence; but we consider it as an example of a great class of abuses, to which a too severe and unremitting attention cannot be applied.&#x2014;We discovered, in the course of our examination of Mr. C. De Coetlogon, late naval storekeeper at St. Domingo, that Mr. James Dick had been concerned in a traffic of spurious coin: we therefore called upon the lords commissioners of the Admiralty, and the Navy Board, for the papers relating to that transaction; by which it appears, that two boxes, containing base money, had been found on board his majesty's ship Adventure, at St. Domingo, addressed to Mr. Dick, as naval storekeeper at Jamaica; in one of which was a letter from the manufacturer at Birmingham, with his bill, amounting to 100l. 15s. and stating, that he had sent him a Pattern Johannes, and some two-sous pieces, which it was hoped would answer his purpose; and by a reference to a passage in the letter, it appears that it was not the first transaction of the kind in which he had been concerned. Mr. Dick pretends to have acted in this business only as an agent for a person then deceased. We thought it proper to make some enquiry into this matter, though not directly connected with his official conduct, that it might be known such practices did exist, and ought to be prevented.&#x2014;That the agents of government should be interested, or, as it is termed, stand to the rise or fall of the exchange is highly improper; it may be well supposed that this neither has nor will be done, for any length of time, but to the disadvantage of the public; however, to serve a present purpose, it may be pretended, where the exchange is seldom below par, an agent would not venture to forego constant and large profits, by claiming a reimbursement of casual and trifling losses; but should any change of circumstances render the discount or loss on bills considerable and permanent, a regard to private interest will never fail to shift the loss from the individual to the public: at all events it is a secret and underhand dealing, always to be discouraged; how far it really did prevail in the case before us, we have not been able to ascertain. It appears by the evidence, that the exchange on government bills was never at a discount during the period Mr. Dick acted as storekeeper, whilst the premiums have fluctuated between 2&#x00BD; and 17&#x00BD; per cent.&#x2014;This custom of standing to the profit and loss by the exchange, is stated by Mr. Smith in his evidence; and in the Navy Board's warrant to Mr. Dick, it is allowed to have been the
<col>878</col>
practice, until they supposed it had been put an end to by their warrant of 4th Sept. 1795. Upon this practice, so mentioned in the Navy Board's warrant, Mr. Dick builds the defence of his conduct; yet we find, by looking back only to the year 1781, that 40,000l. was sent out in specie to Jamaica by government, and that 5000l. was remitted to the naval storekeeper in Dec. of the same year; a proof that such practice had not been invariable or of long standing: so that a prescriptive right from established custom cannot be with propriety pleaded, especially when it is taken into consideration, that a contrary practice prevailed at the other stations; and we can discover no reason which should have taken the storekeeper at Jamaica out of the common rule, and have given rim such extraordinary advantages.&#x2014;We have before staled, that the consideration of he premium on bills drawn from Jamaica, vas taken up by the Board of Ordnance in 1786, whilst the first notice of it in the naval department there was not until 9 years afterwards, when the premium had risen to 15l per cent. We repeat this, in order to introduce an observation, that much benefit might be derived from a communication between the different departments of the state on such subjects; and we recommend that the governors of the different colonies, and the consuls abroad, should be directed to send home monthly an account of the actual rates of exchange within that period, to be lodged and recorded in some public office, to which the different departments may have recourse for the purpose of comparing the rates of exchange at which their several agents may credit government. The only check the Navy Board at present have, by their regulations, on the exchange, is, an annual account of it, as it stood in each of the preceding months of the year; this is seldom transmitted properly authenticated by two merchants, as required; and at any rate comes too late for checking abuses as they arise. At Jamaica the storekeeper has been in the practice of sending home an account of the exchange, signed only by himself, omitting to specify the amount of premium, or discount on his bills.&#x2014;The premiums on the bills drawn by the present naval storekeeper at Jamaica are now regularly brought to account; and that this may not be again lost sight of, we do strongly recommend, that in each of the several naval departments, it be made the duty of some person to examine the rates of exchange at which bills may be drawn; as there seems to be too
<image src="S1V0003P0I0454"/>
<col>879</col>
much reason to apprehend that the subject has been very little attended to, and that the public has thereby sustained very considerable loss; and we do further recommend, that the following forms be adopted by the several agents abroad for drawing bills, and charging themselves therewith in their cash accounts, viz.</p>

custom which prevails in America and most other places.&#x2014;And it having been represented to us, that government bills drawn in large sums, have not obtained so high a premium as they would have done, if divided, to suit the convenience of individuals; we therefore recommend, that the bills of exchange should be made out in such sums, not less than 100l. as may be desired by the person tendering the best rate of exchange.&#x2014;By the present regulations, all stores wanted at foreign stations, are to be procured by advertisement for tenders, and a preference given to the person whose terms are most advantageous; where these lenders are fairly received and acted upon, no further security can be required for the public interest: it behoves the superior board to be attentive to the proofs that are exacted by the regulations on this head, and to examine into, cases of irregular conduct with scrupulous exactness; and, however unwilling we are to take the side of severity, we are bound to suggest the necessity of removing from their stations those who, after repeated admonitions, evade or neglect the faithful discharge of their duty; and to apply the general principle to the case before us, we must express our opinion, that so many circumstances of suspicion and misconduct attended the late naval officer at Jamaica, that he should not have been suffered so long to remain in office.&#x2014;Admiral Sir Hyde Parker, in his letters to the Navy Board of the 20th Feb. and 22d March 1800, states a suspicion of collusion and fraud, in the manner in which some purchases of stores were made of Mr. E. Broughton: we were therefore led to some enquiry respecting him, and found that he was the brother of the first clerk in the storekeepers' office; a young man just set up in business in a small way, and not likely on his own account to have had such large concerns in trade.&#x2014;We also found, that most of the bills of exchange were drawn in favour of Mr. W. Richard Wade, who was the Naval Storekeepers' extra clerk, instead of the real persons concerned in the advance of the money. However Commercial transactions between private persons may be conducted, it is safest, for the prevention of collusive dealings, that those in which the public are interested, should be managed openly: we would therefore recommend, that in all contracts or purchases made abroad, the real names of the parties concerned should appear in the accounts, and that orders to this effect be issued to the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0455"/>
<col>881</col>
officers of government at the different stations.&#x2014;We must here beg leave to remark, that the multiplicity of accounts, which in a war so widely extended as the last, load the shelves of the public offices, where they are not unfrequently left for years without examination, and some of them until the return of peace enables the clerks to compare the charges with the vouchers, and report upon their regularity, is productive of great evil to the public service; for by the time the accounts are examined, the accountant may be dead, or removed out of reach, and all redress against him, for improper or fraudulent charges, rendered extremely difficult, or impossible. And after all, to what does the examination go? merely to a comparison of the charges with the vouchers; so much time has elapsed, that an investigation into the real prices, were it attempted, would be scarcely practicable. In fact, it is the regularity, not the justness of the account that is enquired into; what the articles purchased ought to have cost, does not appear to be a subject of investigation.&#x2014;We have been told, there is not a sufficient number of clerks to keep up the accounts in time of war, in the manner that they should be done, to notice and curb at the outset any tendency to abuse. An increase of establishments, already burthensome, deserves the most serious consideration, but the advantages that may be derived from the speedy examination of all disbursements, will more than overbalance any additional expence incurred on this account; and we beg leave to repeat and urge a recommendation of the Commissioners appointed to enquire into the Fees and Perquisites of Office contained in their Fifth Report; viz. "The Accounts of all officers employed on foreign service, ought to be examined as soon as possible after received, and always before the receipt of them is acknowledged, in order to check improper expenditures, which, by not being noticed, the officers may conceive are approved, and continue them."&#x2014;In order to ascertain, at any time, what has been the progress in the examination of accounts, every account should have the name of the examining clerk, and the time when the examination took place affixed to it. All warrants directing any new regulation or alteration in prices, or enforcing a more regular obedience to articles in standing orders, grown into habitual neglect, should be carefully notified to the clerks of the departments to which they
<col>882</col>
relate. Had this rule been observed when the former Naval Officer at Jamaica was dismissed, the evils that have since arisen would have been in a great measure prevented.&#x2014;Every Naval Storekeeper, or other person entrusted with purchases abroad, or expenditure of the public money, should be required to attest upon oath on his monthly cash account, that he neither has nor expects to receive, directly or indirectly, any benefit whatsoever from such expenditure; and that the purchases so made by him, have been effected without favour to any one, and upon the best terms for the public.&#x2014;By the 33d article of the Instructions from the Navy Board, to Naval Storekeepers on foreign stations, they are required to give a general receipt for the papers left in the office to which they succeed; but as this receipt is not accompanied with a schedule of the public documents delivered over, it can be of little use; we therefore beg leave to recommend, that all the Naval Storekeepers abroad, and others in similar situations, be immediately required to transmit a schedule of the instructions, warrants., and other public documents in their possession, intended for the guidance of their general conduct; that any deficiency may be supplied; and that upon a change of officers in future, a like schedule be sent by the person succeeding to the office with his first dispatches, to be preserved in the proper department at home. These may be easily classed under their respective heads, and a form sent out for the direction of the officers in this respect. The Naval Storekeepers abroad being under the immediate inspection and controul of the commanding officers of the different Stations; and Rear Ad. William Parker, in his letter of the 14th July 1795, noticing the premium not being brought to account, and referring to his instructions on that head, we required from the Admiralty a Copy of the Instructions given to the Commanders in Chief; we likewise enquired whether they were furnished by the Navy Board with copies of the general Regulations for the Civil Departments Abroad; we found, by the evidence of the comptroller, that they were supplied with these regulations, if application was made for them, but not of course; we therefore recommend that commanders in chief be always furnished by the Navy Board with a Copy of the Instructions, and all documents being instructions, to enable them to superintend the conduct of the officers of
<image src="S1V0003P0I0456"/>
<col>883</col>
the Naval Departments abroad, which instructions they should leave with their successors: we are aware how much during war a commander in chief's time is taken up with the military part of his duty; but as the good conduct of the officers entrusted with the civil departments, depends almost entirely on the strictness which he may uniformly require to be observed by them, and on his vigilance and attention to prevent; and correct abuses, we think he ought to have authority to investigate the accounts of such officers in any way he may judge proper; and to suspend or remove those whose misconduct may be injurious to the public service. This part of the duty of a commander in chief cannot too strongly be impressed on his mind; it is not by the number of cases only, in which the interference of a superior board or officer is exercised, that the utility of such inspection and controul is to be estimated; it is rather to be judged of by the spirit of rectitude and zeal for the due performance of duty, which such known watchfulness inspires, and by the temptation to fraud which it prevents.&#x2014;In looking to the expence of the Artificers, and other incidental charges of the yard at Jamaica, we are struck with the magnitude of the sum, but have no means of ascertaining the propriety of the expenditure; there were other officers on the establishment of the yard, besides the naval storekeeper; bin it would appear, that though they, as the form required, subscribed their names to the accounts, the entire management rested with Mr. Dick.&#x2014;By the acknowledgment both Mr. Smith and Mr. Dick, on their examinations, it appears that in another instance they were guilty of a violation of their instructions; for the 18th article directs, that "No servant, artificer, or workman, that is the property of the naval storekeeper, shall be directly or indirectly borne in the service, or employed in the work of the yard," they having been in the constant practice of bearing several of their own slaves as artificers and labourers, for whose service they received the pay of government: We do therefore recommend, that the attention
<col>884</col>
of the commanders in chief be directed to this point, and that they do from time to time suggest to the Navy Board, any alterations or improvements in the instructions to their officers, which they may think will be advantageous to the public service; and also report the instances in which the existing regulations may not be complied with.&#x2014;Amongst complaints against the late naval storekeeper at Jamaica, is one from the deputy postmaster general at Jamaica, for refusing to give bills for the money which he wanted to remit, and which on that account remained at a risk in his hands, till it accumulated to a large sum: it was at last sent home in private bills at a year's sight. The loss by the exchange was the inducement for retaining the money in Jamaica, no other opportunity of remitting it at par occurring, but through the naval officer, who managed to evade the orders he had received to furnish such bills. To prevent the like difficulty from occurring in future, notice should be duly given by the agents of the post-office, of the money they have or are likely to have occasion to remit, which should be the first money taken after such notice; but we see no reason why the bills should be granted at any other than the then actual rate of exchange: it is only by this means that the real expence or receipt of each separate department can be truly stated; to the general government of the country it is of no concern, as what is lost by one of its departments becomes a gain to the other. It may also have its use, should other means fail of keeping alive the remembrance of the gain pr loss on the exchange.&#x2014;In forming an opinion of the conduct of the late naval storekeeper, the consideration of his salary, and the other authorized emoluments of his situation, could not but present itself to our notice. Had these been found deficient, some extenuation for illicit advantages might have been admitted; for it is hardly to be expected, that offices of trust and consideration will be properly executed, where the public allowances do not afford an adequate compensation.&#x2014;The following Account will shew what were Mr. Dick's appointments;</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01662">* We have charged this as an emolument, it being taken as an average from the balance of his victualling account, although the amount has not been received by Mr Dick, payment being withheld by the commissioners of the victualling on account of a debt due from him to that department, as purser of his majesty's ship Ramillies. It may be observed, that we bring into the account his commission on the whole of his expenditure, whilst we reprobate great part of the purchases on which this commission chiefly arose; the commission on the whole amount of his purchases is 2,622l. 16s. 11d. deducting even one-third of this, it would have left him an annual average income of 1,452l. 9s. 6d. st. which we think must be considered such a compensation as might have secured the public his best services, without grasping at further emolument.&#x2014;The examination of Mr. Dick brought to our notice certain possessions belonging to the crown under the superintendance of the naval storekeeper at Jamaica; of which there appears to have been kept a very imperfect account. What records of crown lands there may be preserved at the other stations abroad, under the naval departments of the state, we have not had an opportunity of knowing; it was not indeed the object of our researches, but having fallen in our way, we did not think it right to pass it by without some observation, in order to draw the public attention to the subject in other cases where it may be required.&#x2014;At the same time that we have been induced to propose some alterations in the general instructions to the officers of his majesty's foreign yards, we think it just to observe, that they appear to have been drawn up with great care and attention to the public interest, and to. offer abundant

<p id="S1V0003P0-01665">ON considering the different subjects to which our enquiries had been directed by the legislature, the institution for the relief of Seamen maimed and wounded in the service of their country, denominated "The "Chest at Chatham," seemed to claim our

<col>887</col>
early attention; as it had been represented to us, that the unfortunate objects for whose relief it was established, did not derive so much benefit from the institution as it might be made to afford them.&#x2014;In order to obtain a knowledge of the constitution of the Chest, to ascertain the amount and appropriation of its revenues, and to see what improvements could be made in conducting the general concerns of the establishment, we caused the following papers and accounts to be laid before us.&#x2014;No. 1. A decree of a commission, held by virtue of an order in council, dated the 22d of July 1616, shewing the constitution of the Chest.&#x2014;No. 2. Public officers, and expences of the establishment, from 1791 to 1802 inclusive.&#x2014;No. 3. The duties of the several officers of the establishment.&#x2014;No. 4. General Abstract of receipts and disbursements from 1791 to 1802.&#x2014;No. 5. An account of money in the funds belonging to the Chest.&#x2014;No. 6. An account of the real properly of the Chest; with the net receipts for the last 20 years.&#x2014;No. 7. An account of the actual defalcations from 1791 to 1802.&#x2014;No. 8. A scale of pensions proportioned to hurts and wounds.&#x2014;No. 9. An account of the number of pensioners paid in each year, from 1791 to 1802.&#x2014;No. 10. An account of the number of pensioners discharged well, in the year 1802, with the amount of the saving to the Chest.&#x2014;No. 11. An account of the number of pensioners, whose pensions, were augmented in the year 1802, with the amount of the expence thereby created.&#x2014;No. 12. An account of the number of pensioners, whose pensions have been reduced in the year 1802; with the amount of the saving to the Chest.&#x2014;The original written constitution of the Chest is supposed to have been lost during the usurpation of Cromwell; but it appears, from the record of a decree, dated 1st May 1617, made in consequence of an inquisition held at the castle at Rochester, by virtue of an order in council of the preceding year, that in 1590, the masters, mariners, shipwrights, and seafaring men, employed in the service of Q. Elizabeth, did, with the consent and persuasion of the lord high admiral of England, and the principal officers of the Navy Royal, voluntarily give and bestow, and consent to have stopped out of their wages, the following sums, viz. Out of the wages of every mariner, seaman, and shipwright, receiving 10s. or more per month, 6d. per month.&#x2014;Out of the wages of every grommett, receiving 7s. 6d. fourpence: and out of the wages of
<col>888</col>
every boy receiving 5s. per month, 2d.&#x2014;For the perpetual relief of such mariners, shipwrights, and seafaring men, as by reason of hurts and maims received in the service, were driven into great distress and want. It was also consented unto, and established by the said parties, that the like defalcations should from time to time, for ever, be made for the relief of such hurt and maimed mariners, shipwrights, and seamen, as then did, or should hereafter serve in the royal navy, or in any other ship or vessel in the royal service, either at sea or in harbour: the money to be distributed at the discretion of the masters attendant, master shipwrights, boatswains, and pursers of the royal navy, for the time being, or some of every of the said several sorts and ranks, from time to time, as cause shall require, and by the oversight of the principal officers of the navy for the time being, or some of them; that the overplus of the money should be preserved in a strong chest with five locks, of which the keys were to be kept separately, one by a principal officer of the navy, another by a master attendant, another by a master shipwright, another by a boatswain, and the other by a purser; and so to remain for one whole year; and at the end of every year, to be delivered by each of the said several officers to one other officer of the same rank, and so yearly in succession.&#x2014;To the amount of the defalcations before mentioned, K. Charles H. gave to the Chest 12 acres of marshland, situated near Rochester, called Delce: and we find by the records, that, previous to 1672, the fund was increased by the four pences and two pences deducted from the monthly wages of all seamen, for the pay of chaplains and surgeons of the navy in such ships where none are borne; and, in 1688, the fines and mulcts imposed by naval courts martial wereadded, by a grant of K. James II. Upon this basis, the business of the Chest has been carried on, without any material alteration, to the present time; but the shipwrights no longer contributing, are excluded from receiving any benefit from the fund. The affairs of the Chest are managed by two supervisors and 9 governors; the former are the comptroller of the navy and the resident commissioner of Chatham yard; and the latter, with the addition of two gunners, are chosen in the manner pointed out by the decree. The allotment and payment of pensions, the administration of the funds, and all other ordinary business, is conducted by the governors; but no change of system, or general regulations, can be carried into effect,

<p id="S1V0003P0-01667">By the evidence of Mr. E. Soan Twopeny, it would appear, that the estates were never surveyed previous to his becoming the attorney of the Chest; that no circumstances have existed to prevent their increasing equally in value with other lands, except
<col>890</col>
1803, a fund had been created of 281,500l: stock, standing in the names of Sir A. S. Hammond, bart. comptroller of the navy; F. Hartwell, esq. one of the commissioners of the navy; Mr. J. Madgshon, master at Pendant of Chatham yard; and Mr. E. Sison, formerly master shipwright of that yard.&#x2014;There is also a further sum in the 3 per cent. consols of 2,208l. 18s. 10d. in the name of the Deputy Remembrancer of the Exchequer, as the value of a certain part of the estate of Godsight, taken by government for the purpose of increasing the fortifications at Chatham.&#x2014;The funds of the Chest are considerably increased during war, as the defalcations alone very much exceed the expenditure; but in time of peace the reverse is the case, as the paying off the navy gives opportunity to all who have been wounded or hurt to apply for relief, by which the expenditure is increased, whilst the revenue is diminished by the reduced amount of the defalcations arising from a peace establishment.&#x2014;Soon after the institution, there seems to have been considerable difficulty in recovering from the governors, and their heirs, money due to the Chest remaining in their hands, which probably led to the vesting the surplus money in lands.&#x2014;The net average profits of the real estates, including the houses built thereon, for the last twenty years, has been 657l. 7s. 5d.&#x2014;To shew how little the rents of the farms have been increased, we have extracted the following account; and from the average net proceeds of the last 20 years therein stated, we have deducted the increased rent on account of the land tax which has been redeemed, in order to shew the clear average profits of the money kid out in the purchase of those farms; viz.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01668">Mackland, a part of which has been washed away by the sea; and that the estate called Scocles, leased in 1789 for 21 years, at 105l. is worth from 3 to 4000l. per ann.&#x2014;It also appears, that the 12 acres of marsh land given by K. Chs, II. instead of producing any profit
<image src="S1V0003P0I0460"/>
<col>891</col>
in the 55 years preceding 1784, actually caused an expence of 38l. 1s. 7d. to the Chest. We can attribute these circumstances, and the very trifling increase of rents made of the farms in a period of near 200 years, to no other cause than to culpable mismanagement.&#x2014;The estate called Godsight, situated at Chatham, having been let on building leases, has been very much improved in its value, notwithstanding a fire which destroyed a great part of the premises in 1800; but we observe the sum of 2,188l. 8s. 11d. has been lately expended by the governors in building 2 houses in Hammond Place, Chatham, which have been leased for 7 years, at an annual rent of 95l. there by producing only 4l. 6s. 9d. per cent. on the money actually laid out, without taking into consideration the value of the ground belonging to the Chest on which they are erected. On due consideration of the circumstances before stated, and from the mismanagement and general want of improvement in estates belonging to public bodies, more especially where the managers of them are frequently changed, we think it advisable, and do strongly recommend the sale of the estates and premises belonging to the Chest, and that their produce be added to the other money in the three per cent, annuities; by which, we conceive, the income of the Chest will be considerably increased.&#x2014;Besides a general knowledge of the subject to be obtained from the papers and statements transmitted to us, there were circumstances necessary to our information, which could not be satisfactorily ascertained without an enquiry on the spot. We therefore proceeded to Chatham: where we had reference to the original minutes and books of the office: and examined some of the governors and officers of the Chest, as well as the agents employed by the pensioners in receiving and remitting their pensions.&#x2014;In the minutes of the proceedings of the governors, the transactions relating to their trust seemed to be fully detailed; and we must do those who are at present in office the justice to observe, that their accounts appeared to be kept with great regularity.&#x2014;The process by which a person wounded or hurt in his majesty's naval service, is enabled to claim relief from the Chest, is as follows: The surgeon, with the approbation of the captain, fills up a certificate, or smart ticket (printed forms of which he is furnished with) by inserting the name and age of the party, the nature of the wound or hurt, when received, and the service he was employed on at the
<col>892</col>
time; which is signed by the captain, surgeon, and other officers, and delivered to the party previous to his being discharged, or sent to any of his majesty's hospitals; the surgeon keeps an account of such smart tickets as may be granted, which is sent to the Navy Office, and forwarded from thence to the governors of the Chest for their guidance. Upon the parties producing the smart ticket, or in case of its being lost, if it should appear upon reference to the surgeon's list, that one had been granted, the governors and surgeon proceed to examine him; and if the hurt received should not have deprived the party of the power to gain a livelihood, a sum of money is given in full satisfaction for the injury received, called "smart "money;" but in case the wounds or hurts are severe, a yearly pension is granted, and an allowance, not exceeding the amount of the pension, is made to the party, for the purpose of defraying the expence of his journey to his home, which is denominated "pre-"sent relief."&#x2014;At the time of granting pensions, tickets or certificates are given to the parties, expressing the amount of their pensions, and their duration; being for 1, 3, 5, or 7 years, according to the nature of the injury received. The object in granting pensions for a limited time is not only to prevent frauds, by ascertaining the actual existence of the parties at stated periods, but that the governors may have opportunity of proportioning the pensions to the ability of the parties to maintain themselves. On their reappearance at the Chest, they are examined by the governors and surgeon, and if their wounds or hurts continue in the same state, their pensions are renewed; if better, they are reduced; if worse, augmented: and, if the party is perfectly recovered, his pension is entirely discontinued.&#x2014;The hardship of subjecting pensioners indiscriminately to a periodical appearance at the Chest, at whatever distance their residence may happen to be, has been of late in some measure alleviated: in cases of total blindness, or very severe wounds, the governors have granted pensions for life; but the loss of a limb has not been deemed sufficient to entitle them to that indulgence.&#x2014;That the purposes for which this institution was originally established, may be rendered more effectual, we think that all possible facility ought to be given to the receipt of the pensions; and we can see no reason why any persons, who have suffered the amputation of limbs, or received other incurable and disabling wounds, should at any time after their admission, be
<image src="S1V0003P0I0461"/>
<col>893</col>
subjected to the pain and expence of personal attendance at the Chest. We therefore recommend, that, in all Such cases, the parties be admitted pensioners for life, and such pensioners only be required at any time hereafter to appear at the Chest, the nature of whose wounds may afford a reasonable probability of amendment.&#x2014;The: business of the trust is conducted by the; governors at meetings held monthly, beginning on the first Tuesday in every month; and at an annual meeting early in June.&#x2014;At the former, the governors meet for the purpose of examining such persons as appear with smart tickets, as also such whose pensions may have ceased from the termination of their tickets; and at the latter, for the general payment of the annual pensions, which become due on the 25th of March.&#x2014;If a person having a claim on the Chest should arrive at Chatham after the monthly meetings are concluded, he almost unavoidably falls into the hands of one of the agents for pensioners, chiefly keepers of public houses, by whom he is entertained till the meeting of the governors in the succeeding month; as a security for the debt thus incurred, he leaves his pension; ticket in deposit, and a power of attorney for the agent to receive his pension at the, next yearly payment: to entitle the agent to receive the pension for the year, he must produce a certificate of the life of the party, which may be made out on or after, the 1st of March. If the agent advances any part of the pension, after receiving the certificate of life in March, when it is due, and before it is paid in June, the regular charge is 1s. 6d. in the pound, or 7&#x00BD; per cent; but if the advance is made at any time, however short, before the 1st of March, the agent deducts 5s. in the pound, or 25 per cent. for risk and commission; so that between the incitement to a wasteful expence offered by the publican, and the extortionate charges of the agent, the benevolent purposes of the institution are in a great measure frustrated; and it maybe a question whether it is, upon the whole, productive of more good than evil to the parties and their families.&#x2014;In order to know what proportion of the pensions was paid to the parties themselves, and what through the medium of their agents, to enable us to form a judgment of the extent of the abuses arising from the present mode of payment, we caused the pay book to be examined, by which it appears, that out of 5,205 pensions, only 309 were paid to
<col>894</col>
pensioners appearing in person, being in the proportion of 1 to 17. Our opinion respecting he objects of this institution, isstreng thened by the observations and proposals laid before us by C. Hope, esq. commissioner of he navy at Chatham, and resident supervisor of the Chest.&#x2014;To relieve the pensioners from the extortionate commission charged by the agents, and to enable them by habits of industry in their respective parishes, to contribute to the support of their wives and families, and to prevent their becoming public beggars, and useless members of society, to which, we fear, their journies to Chatham too frequently lead, we recommend that their pensions be remitted to them half yearly, and made payable at their respective homes, by means of the officers of the Customs and Excise, according to the mode now practised in the payment of the out-pensioners of Greenwich Hospital.&#x2014;To prevent the impositions which may arise from the adoption of the proposed measures, we recommend that books be kept, containing particular descriptions of the persons of all the pensioners, one for the pensioners for life, and another for those whose pensions are for a limitted time; and that all pensioners may be accurately described; those now enjoying limitted pensions should be obliged to appear at the Chest at the expiration of their present tickets; and that to entitle the pensioners to the payment of their pensions, the certificates of life should contain descriptions of their persons corresponding with those entered in the description book, and be signed by the minister and churchwardens of the parish in which they may reside, and attested before a magistrate.&#x2014;The affairs of the Chest being administered by a fluctuating body, removeable every year, and actually changed in two years, is liable to many objections; the constant and minute attention necessary to secure the due administration of so great and extensive a trust, obviously requires that it should be executed by a distinct board, composed of men of diligence and ability, and constantly resident on the spot.&#x2014;In the consideration of this subject, the Royal Hospital at Greenwich, as being instituted for nearly similar purposes, presented itself to us as the most eligible Department under which it could be placed.&#x2014;We therefore recommend, that the Chest at Chatham be removed to Greenwich Hospital, to be managed as a separate branch of that institution, and henceforth denominated The
<image src="S1V0003P0I0462"/>
<col>895</col>
Chest at Greenwich.&#x2014;The removal of the Chest to Greenwich, besides the advantage of a permanent government, would present the possibility of the pensioners receiving relief from both institutions, and offer an easy selection of persons from the partial relief of one to the superior and lasting benefit of the other; from its being fixed in the neighbourhood of the metropolis, it would afford an easy and cheap conveyance by water to such persons as are obliged to appear at the Chest, instead of travelling by land to Chatham; the expence of conducting-money to Chatham, for the payment of pensions, would be avoided, and also the expence of the journies of the accountant to London, for the purpose of vesting money in, or selling out of the funds, and transacting the necessary business with the public offices.&#x2014;If, in opposition to the removal of the Chest, were urged, that, having been founded originally on voluntary contribution, and the conduct of the trust allotted to a particular description of persons, any innovation would be an infraction of the original compact; it might be replied, that although the stoppages from the wages of seamen might, in the first instance, be felt as a real deduction, yet that an increase of wages having at different times been made, in which these defalcations had no doubt been duly considered, this mode of establishing a fund for their relief could no longer be said to operate as a diminution of their pay; besides, the grants of the mulcts, the stoppages for the pay of chaplains and surgeons in certain cases, and of the free gift of land of King Ch. II. are acts wholly independent of the first institution.&#x2014;It does not appear, by a reference to the decree made in 1617, that the payments of the Chest were meant to be confined to any one place; for it is there stated, that Sir Peter Buck, and others, did owe to the Chest certain sums, being balances of accounts of money entrusted to them to be distributed to divers hurt and maimed persons at the places where they dwelt; at that time the River Medway being the general rendezvous and depot for the fleet, the greatest part of the payments were made at Chatham: but, whatever might have occasioned the first establishment of the Chest at that place, there seems to exist, at the present day, no cause for its continuance; and that the interests of the institution alone should be considered, both with respect to the place, and the manner, in which its affairs should be con-
<col>896</col>
ducted.&#x2014;To obviate any objection that might be made to this change, that the persons in office would suffer in their reasonable expectations, we have to observe, that the governors, by the rules of the establishment, continue in office only for 2 years; that they are chosen from such boatswains, gunners, and pursers, as belong to ships which happen to be at Chatham, and of course liable at all times to be called away.&#x2014;We propose, 1. that all matters at present under the superintendance of the supervisors of the Chest at Chatham, be transferred to, and placed under the controul of the first lord commissioner of the admiralty, the comptroller of the navy, and the governor and auditor of the royal hospital at Greenwich for the time being, as supervisors:&#x2014;2. That the immediate administration of the affairs of the Chest at Greenwich, the management of the funds, the allotment and payment of pensions, and all other duties now performed by the governors, be conducted by 5 persons selected and appointed by the supervisors from the lieut. governor, captains, and lieutenants, on that establishment, being such as from their state of health, and other considerations, may be judged most competent to perform the duties of the office; these to be called "Directors of the Chest at Greenwich;" any vacancies by death, resignation, or removal by the supervisors, to be immediately filled up by the remaining directors, subject to the approbation of the supervisors:&#x2014;3. That a proper office be allotted, either within or near to the hospital, for the meetings of the directors, and transacting the business:&#x2014;4. That all the records, books, and accounts, now in the custody of the governors of the Chest at Chatham, be delivered over to the directors of the Chest at Greenwich, and by them carefully preserved:&#x2014;5. That the money belonging to the Chest at Chatham in the funds, be transferred to, and stand in the names of "The Supervisors of the Chest at Greenwich," as a corporate bodv:&#x2014;6. To prevent persons soliciting relief from being unnecessarily detained, we propose, that a meeting of the directors be held weekly instead of monthly, as at present:&#x2014;7. The necessity for the interposition of agents being done away by the mode proposed of paying pensions at the respective places of abode or the pensioners, all powers of attorney, and bargains for the sale of pensions, should be rendered illegal:&#x2014;3. All letters and packets, for the purposes of the trust, should be allowed to pass free of postage:&#x2014;9. We re-

<col>897</col>
commend, that the rules and regulations for the conduct of the officers of the Chest now in use, be continued in force, except where they may militate against the proposed amendments; and that all future regulations made by the directors, before they are carried into effect, be sanctioned by the approval of the supervisors:&#x2014;10. In addition to the officers before enumerated, it will be necessary to have an accountant, with sufficient clerks, to perform the business of the office, whose appointment, we think, should</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01677">HAVING had reason to apprehend that some irregularities had obtained in supplying His Majesty's Navy with Blockmaker's wares, we were, in pursuance of the duty imposed on us by the legislature, induced to call on the principal officers and commissioners of His Majesty's Navy for a copy of their Contract with Mr. Walter Taylor of Southampton, and for copies of their several warrants to the officers of the yards, for increasing and reducing the Prices of the articles to be supplied.&#x2014;This Contract was not made according to the genera practice of the Navy Board, by public advertisement for tenders, and closing will the person making the lowest, but the terms offered by Mr. Taylor, having been deemed advantageous to the public by the Navy Board, were submitted to the consideration of the right hon. the Lords Commissioner of the Admiralty, and approved.&#x2014;The Contract is dated the 8th of April 1791, by which Mr. Taylor engaged to supply His Majesty's Yards at Deptford, Woolwich Chatham, Sheerness, Portsmouth, and Plymouth, with Blockmaker's wares, at an abatement of 10 per cent. from the price specified in a former Contract, dated the 30th Sept. 1779, and from the prices o additional articles enumerated in this Contract; for which he was to have bills mad out, as he demanded them, to be paid in course, according to the rules of the Navy; and to the amount of his bills was to b added-the discount which navy bills might
<col>900</col>
appear to have borne, by Casting's paper of the prices of stock last published, previous to the date of his bills; and in case any of his bills should remain unpaid above 6 months from the lime of their being presented at the Navy Office, then he was lo be allowed interest at the rate of 4 per cent. from and after the expiration of the said 6 months.&#x2014;The Contract commenced oil the 8th of Oct. for 7, 14, or 21 years; at the expiration of each of those periods, either party was at liberty to put an end to it, by giving 12 months notice in writing; or, in the event of any other blocks with improved coaked shivers being found, on proper experiments, to be better adapted to the use of the Navy than Mr. Taylor's, then the Navy Board might dissolve the Contract by a similar notice.&#x2014;For the due performance of the covenants contained in this Contract, Mr. Taylor entered into a bond, with two sureties, for 2000l.&#x2014;It may be supposed, from what is before staled, that the terms of this Contract are more favourable to the public than the Contract of 1779; but in fact, it was entered into upon the terms at which that Contract stood, previous to its termination in 1791; an abatement, of 5 per cent. being provided for in the Contract of 1779 in lime of peace, and a further abatement of 5 per cent. having been made in 1785, in consequence of the discount being added to the contractor's bills.&#x2014;In order to give a clear and distinct view of the management 'of this Contract, we shall first state how the supplies of the different yards were branched by Mr. Taylor, and then detail his several applications for increased prices, with the warrants of the Navy Board; thereon; offering such remarks as occur in the course of the detail&#x2014;Mr. Walter Taylor reserved the supply of Portsmouth Yard to himself; but soon after he obtained this; Contract, he entered into an agreement: with Mr. Thomas Fox (then in partnership with Mr. Samuel Taylor and Mr. Irwin,; jun.) for the supply of Deptford and Woolwich Yards, they agreeing to pay him 5 per cent. on the amount of all bills for goods delivered by them, after deducting the fees of office, and other trifling expences: Mr. Walter Taylor supplied the small blocks to F those yards, for the making of which his machinery was particularly adapted.&#x2014;Mr. Walter Taylor entered into an agreement, also, with Mr. Bartholomew Dunsterville of Plymouth, for supplying His Majesty's: Yard there with certain articles of Block-maker's wares; but he reserved to himself
<image src="S1V0003P0I0465"/>
<col>901</col>
the making of Shivers and Pins, the profitable articles of the Contract.&#x2014;Mr. Irvin, senior, had the supply of Chatham and Sheerness Yards.&#x2014;Mr. Walter Taylor, on the 23d of July 1793, stated to the Navy Board, that metal and lignum vit&#x00E6; had advanced &#x00BC;th in price since the date of his Contract; that labour had much risen; and that in consequence of the pressing demands made on him, he had been put to very great expence in sending goods to Deptford and Woolwich by land carriage; and therefore he requested to be allowed the additional price which had been always granted in time of war to Block contractors, stating that Messrs. Farrar and Co. had on their Contract of the 30th of Sept. 1779, (from which his was taken) been allowed an advance of 6 per cent.; and that previous thereto, there had been an allowance, of 10 per cent. during war; but that by some unlucky mistake in wording his Contract, the price had been omitted.&#x2014;On the 5th of Aug. 1793, the Navy Board entered into an agreement with Mr. Walter Taylor for the further supply of certain enumerated articles, at specific prices, subject to the abatement of 10 per cent. and forming with the preceding contracts a common basis for the prices.&#x2014;The Navy Board, in their warrant of the 8th of Aug. 1793, state, that Mr. Waiter Taylor had desired an advance of 6 per cent. on his bills, and direct him to be allowed the 6 per cent. accordingly from the commencement of the then armament, and during the war; the same to be added to the gross amount of his bills, and the deduction of 10 per cent. to be made there from, and not from the advance of 6 per cent.&#x2014;The Navy Board, on the 16th, from the apprehension that the former advances in war on the prices of the Block Contract had been granted in consequence of the discount on navy bills, suspended the operation of their warrant of the 8th; but in consequence of the expostulation of Mr. Walter Taylor, in his letter of the 19th, they on the 23d directed that warrant to be carried into execution.&#x2014;Whether the omission of the war price in Mr. Walter Taylor's Contract was an oversight or not, we think he was not justifiable in making his application to the Navy Board for an advance of 6 per cent. as, at the time he made it, his son and son-in-law, Mr. Thomas Fox and Mr. Samuel Taylor, were actually paying him 5 per cent. for permission to carry on a part of the Contract, and we cannot suppose he would leave them without a reasonable pro-
<col>902</col>
fit on their business; and more especially, as we find that as soon as he did obtain the advance of 6 per cent. he took to himself &#x2153;d of it, and left them to supply Deptford and Woolwich Yards at a reduction of 7 per cent. from the warrant prices of the Navy Board; at which rate they continued to supply those Yards until the 14th of July 1800, when their allowance to Mr. Walter Taylor was reduced to 5 per cent.&#x2014;We are certainly not inclined to think 6 per cent. was a great relative advance, when we consider the probable increased price of labour and materials during war; but we are disposed to conclude, from the circumstances before stated, that the Contract was not, in the first instance, made on terms advantageous to the public.&#x2014;On considering the warrant of the 8th of Aug. we were led to suppose that the Navy Board had given to Mr. Taylor more than he asked, as it states, that he had desired an advance of 6 per cent. on his bills; whereas the mode of directing that advance actually gave him 6l. 13s. 4d. per cent.; and by our examination of Mr. Nelson, secretary to the Navy Board, we had reason to believe it was so: but by his subsequent explanation, a statement from the Board, and a reference to the practice under another Contract, we find that the warrant in question was made out in conformity to general custom, and that Mr. Taylor got no more than he intended to apply for.&#x2014;In the beginning of 1705, Mr. B. Dunsterville, being dissatisfied with his former agreement, entered into a covenant with Mr. Walter Taylor, dated the 12th of Feb. by which the latter assigned to the former his Contract with the Navy Board, as far as it related to the supply of Plymouth Yard, on Mr. Dunsterville's agreeing to pay him 2d. per lb. on the weight of all such Lignum Vit&#x00E6;, Brass Coaked Shivers, and Iron Pins, as he might deliver under the Contract in Blocks only, but not upon the Shivers and Pins supplied without Blocks; and Mr. Taylor reserved to himself, by special agreement, the supply of Brass-webbed Shivers, and Iron Pins to be used therewith.&#x2014;Mr. Dunsterville, in his evidence stales, that the 2d. per lb. on Lignum Vit&#x00E6;, Brass Coaked Shivers, and Iron Pins, which he paid to Mr. Taylor, amounted to between 9 and 10 per cent. on the whole amount of the bills made out for the supply of Plymouth Yard, and that Mr. Taylor continued to enjoy this advantage until the Contract with government was put an end to.&#x2014;Mr. Thomas Fox, in his evidence
<image src="S1V0003P0I0466"/>
<col>903</col>
informs us, that he was in the practice of supplying the East India Co's. ships with the same sort of Blocks as he did the King's Yards; that in consequence of the pressure of government business in 1796, it became necessary to give it up, or sacrifice the India business; that he and Mr. Samuel Taylor resolved on the latter, and that Mr. Irwin, jun. formerly their partner, took it up: that at the time they relinquished it, the prices paid by the East India Co's. shipping were from 10 to 15 per cent. higher than the government prices; yet the supply of Deptford and Woolwich Yards was more profitable, from the very large amount of the articles supplied.&#x2014;Mr. Fox states further, that about 1796 Mr. Irwin, sen. gave up the supply of Chatham and Sheerness Yards; that he and Mr. Samuel Taylor, having no additional machinery to erect, undertook the supply of those Yards; and that as Mr. Irwin had been many years a party in the Contract, they allowed him 4 per cent. upon the amount of the bills for goods delivered at Chatham and Sheerness, after deducting the expence of Fees, Mr. Walter Taylor's allowance of 5 per cent. and the advance of 6 per cent. granted by the Navy Board's warrant.&#x2014;We learn from this evidence, that Mr. T. Fox and Mr. S. Taylor were actually paying, from 1796 to the 14th of July 1800, nearly 11 per cent. on the amount of the bills for goods delivered by them at Chatham and Sheerness Yards; viz. the original allowance of 5 per cent. to Mr. Walter Taylor; a further allowance to him of 2 per cent. being &#x2153;d of the 6 per cent. advance granted by the Navy Board, arid the allowance of 4 per cent. to Mr. Irvin, sen.; and that from the latter period, to the termination of the Contract, they continued to pay 9 per cent. on the amount of their goods; viz. Mr. Irwin's 4 per cent. and Mr. Walter Taylor's original allowance of 5 per cent.&#x2014;On the 1st of May 1799, Mr. Walter Taylor represented to the Navy Board, the difficulty he had laboured under, during the war, in procuring Ash Timber to make Capstern Bars and Handspikes, and that he had delivered into Portsmouth Yard only some thousands, by which he had lost at least 200l. a year; he also stated, there were many other articles of Ash Goods in his Contract, by which he had been a great loser, but as they were of an inferior consideration, he did not desire any addition for them; he only required to be allowed 8d. per foot for Capstern Bars instead of
<col>904</col>
5d. and 16d. each for Pump Brakes and Common Handspikes his Contract price for the latter being 10d. and for the former 11d.; and that he might be allowed those prices in the several Yards for such of the articles as had been delivered from the preceding Christmas, and for which bills had not been made out.&#x2014;The Navy Board, in their warrant of the 13th June 1799, after Stating that they had taken into consideration the Reports they had received from the Officers of the several Yards, on reference of an application from Mr. Walter Taylor for an increase of price on Ash Goods, direct certificates to be made out to him for such of the goods under mentioned, as he may have delivered, and has not received certificates for; as also for such as he may afterwards deliver, at the Prices against each expressed, until further Order; viz.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01678">The advance granted by the above warrant on Capstern Bars, an article of considerable consumption and expence, amounts to 60 per cent. but we find a difficulty in stating the precise advance on the other articles, as Common Handspikes, from 7 to 6 feet long, were by the Contract to be charged 10d. and of 7&#x00BD; feet long, One Shilling; and Pump Brakes, from 7 to 6 feet long, 1s. and from 6 to 5 feet, 11d.: the directions to increase these articles, of different lengths, and before of different prices, to one specific price, we conceive arose from a want of reference to the Contract at the time of making the warrant.&#x2014;Having some doubt whether the Navy Board intended that the Prices of Ash Goods, so increased, should be further raised by any per centage advances which might afterwards be granted on articles, the specific prices of which had not been increased, we called on them, and were informed it was their intention, when, they issued the warrant, that the specific prices granted thereby should be subject to the abatements and advances of the then existing and subsequent warrants: if such intention had been expressed in the warrant, it would have prevented much irregularity in the execution of it.&#x2014;Mr. Walter Taylor and son, in their letter of the 23d of June 180O, stated to the Navy Board the great disadvantage they had laboured under from the price and quality of Lignum Vit&#x00E6; ever since the year 1795; that they were no
<image src="S1V0003P0I0467"/>
<col>905</col>
longer able to carry on the service of the Navy for want of that commodity; and that the whole quantity of Lignum Vitae then in the Kingdom would not supply the demands of the Navy for a year; and therefore proposed the fitting all Blocks with brass-webbed Shivers, or that they might be allowed such an additional price to their Contract as would enable them to purchase the Lignum Vitae then in the market.&#x2014;The Navy Board, on the 27th, informed Mr. W. Taylor and son, they did not think it would be proper to introduce the Brass Shivers into further use in His Majesty's Navy; but that they were willing to allow them a certain rate per cent. upon the amount of their bills, for a limited time, to cover the advanced price of Lignum Vit&#x00E6;, and desired to know what rate they considered themselves entitled to.&#x2014;Messrs. Taylor and son, in their reply of the 30th, say, that considering the very disadvantageous conditions under which they had for a considerable time carried on their Contract, particularly within the two last years, they beg leave to submit, that the original deduction of 10 per cent. (explained in a former part of this report) provided for by their Contract, and the subsequent advance of 6 per cent. on the gross amount of their bills be done away: and that whilst the cause of the present grievance prevails, they may hare an allowance of 10 per cent. on the gross amount of the Yard Certificates, and that they may have such advance on the goods they have delivered, for which certificates had not been made out.&#x2014;The request contained in this letter is for an advance of 14l. 11s. 8d. per cent. on the actual amount of their bills; and we cannot help remarking here, on the assertion made by Messrs. Taylor and son, of the very disadvantageous conditions under which they had been carrying on the Contract for a considerable time; as it appears in evidence, that the allowance made by Mr. Bartholomew Dunsterville to Mr. Walter Taylor, from the 12th Feb. 1795, amounted to between 9 and 10 per cent. on the whole amount of the supply of Plymouth Yard; and that from the 8th of Aug. 1793, he actually received from Mr. Irwin, sen. Mr. T. Fox, and Mr. S. Taylor, 7 per cent. on the amount of the goods delivered by them at Deptford, Woolwich, Chatham, and Sheerness Yards. If the conditions on which Messrs. Taylor and son supplied Portsmouth Yard were very disadvantageous, what must have been, the conditions
<col>906</col>
of the Sub-Contractors, particularly of Mr. Thomas Fox and Mr. Samuel Taylor, who had paid since 1796, and were then paying, nearly 11 per cent. for permission to supply Chatham and Sheerness Yards at the prices granted by the warrants of the Navy Board?&#x2014;The Navy Board, by their warrant of the 14th July 1800, direct, for the reasons contained in Messrs. Taylor and son's application, that the abatement of 10 per cent. and the advance of 6 per cent. shall be done away, and that they shall be allowed an addition of 8 per cent. upon their Contract prices for such goods as they may deliver into His Majesty's several Yards, for 9 months, from the 8th of July 1800.&#x2014;This warrant gave to Mr. Waller Taylor an actual advance of 12&#x00BD; per cent. being, with the former advance of the 8th of Aug. 1793, an increase of 20 per cent. on his Contract prices; and on Capstern Bars, the only article named in the warrant of the 13th June 1799, for increasing the price of Ash Goods (which we can state with precision, for the reasons before given) an advance of 92 per cent. from the prices of the Contract. By the evidence of Mr. William Adam, it appears, that the average price of English Ash Timber in 1791 and 1792, was 5l. per load, and in 1799-1800 and 1802, the average price was 6l. 15s. being an Increase of 35 per cent.&#x2014;On the 23d March 1801, Messrs. Taylor and son represented to the Navy Board, that in addition to the cause which had before obliged them to apply for an advance, that Elm, Ash, Metal, and Iron, had risen in an enormous degree, and they therefore requested a continuance of the prices of the warrant of the 14th July 1800, for 9 months longer.&#x2014;The Navy Board, by their warrant of the 28th, direct the advance of 8 per cent. to be continued for 9 months from the expiration of their warrant of the 14th July 1800.&#x2014;Messrs. Taylor and son, in their letter of the 8th of Feb. 1802, state lo the Navy Board, that the time named in the warrant of the 28th March 1891, for continuing the advance of 8 per cent. on their Contract prices, expired on the 8th of Jan. and request it may be continued for 6 months longer, as the whole of their then 18 months stock had been bought in at the war price.&#x2014;The Navy Board, on the 19th, informed Messrs. Taylor and son, that the advances granted were for a limited time only, and that as the same reasons do not exist for continuing them, they must return to the prices allowed by the Contract, for all
<image src="S1V0003P0I0468"/>
<col>907</col>
goods delivered since the 8fh of Jan. then past; and on the same date, the 19th of Feb. 1802, the Navy Board, by warrant, direct the officers of the several Yards to make out certificates for goods delivered accordingly.&#x2014;On the 4th of March, 1802, Messrs. Taylor and son represented to the Navy Board, that they had been, and were then very great sufferers, and request their Contract Prices may be without any deduction for a limited time, and express a hope that soon after peace is settled, a favourable alteration will take place in the price of materials.&#x2014;The Navy Board, in their warrant of the 11th of March, 1802, state, that having taken into consideration a letter from Messrs. Taylor and son, they direct the officers of the several yards (notwithstanding their warrant of the 19th of Feb.) not to make the abatement of 4 per cent. provided for by the Contract of the 8th of April, 1791, upon such goods as Messrs. Taylor and son have delivered since the 8th of Jan. 1802, or may deliver within 6 months from that date. The abatement provided for by the Contract of the 8th of April, 1791, being 10 per cent. and not 4, as quoted in the warrant of the 11th March, 1802, the comptroller and secretary of the navy were examined as to the intention of the Navy Board in granting it, and by their evidence we were led to believe that Messrs. Taylor and son had been considerably overpaid, as no abatement had been made from their bills during the time that warrant was in force; but it has since been represented to us by the Navy Board, that it was their intention that no deduction should he made, and that the naming the 4 per cent. was a mistake of their secretary, who has since informed us, that the Contract was not read at the time of making the minute for the warrant; and that the 4 per cent. having been named in Mr. Taylor's application, was the reason of its being inserted in the minute and warrant.&#x2014;The Lords of the Admiralty, on the 3d of May, 1802, directed the Navy Board to give notice for annulling the Block Contract as soon as possible, and not to purchase any more Blocks from that time.&#x2014;It having been represented to us by Mr. Samuel Taylor, that he believed the Admiralty had referred his father's Contract to their solicitor, who had deemed it invalid, in consequence of its not having been signed by the Navy Board, and it was therefore annulled, we called upon Capt. Markham, one of the lords of the Admiralty, by whom it is stated, that tip reference was
<col>908</col>
made, or thought necessary to be made, as to the validity of the Contract, as it was not considered binding on the public, Mr. Taylor having demanded and received an increase of price on his Contract; and that the Admiralty directed notice to be given for the termination of the Contract, because they considered it an injurious one to the public, and had it in contemplation to erect machinery in Portsmouth Yard for manufacturing Blocks, by which they would be made cheaper and better. Finding it to be difficult to determine the express meaning and intent of some of the warrants for increasing and reducing Mr. Walter Taylor's prices, we called on the Navy Board for a copy of the first bill or certificate for goods delivered, made out to him at each of the Yards, under his Contract, and under each of the several warrants for increasing and reducing his prices; and also for an account of the bills made out to him at the several Yards, from the commencement of his Contract, in order to see how the several warrants had been understood and acted upon. From the very loose manner in which some of the warrants are worded, we are not surprised to find that they have been so differently interpreted and acted upon at the several Yards; but we are at a loss to account how the certificates could be suffered to pass at the Navy Office, where they all came under the examination of one person, whose special duty it is to see that they are made out in exact conformity to the orders of the Board, and who has an easy reference for explanation, if he should judge it necessary: we do therefore recommend that the warrants of the Navy Board be worded with more circumspection, and that more attention be paid to the examination of the Yard certificates, before they are passed into bills. And, in order to prevent a recurrence of similar evils, we do strongly recommend the doing away the present practice of making the prices of Contracts subject to a variety of abatements and advances, which render the accounts to be made out under them complicated, and by multiplying calculations, liable to error. We think all Contracts which are formed by percentage biddings on specific prices, and further agreements for articles which may be required of Contractors, should form a common scale or basis for the prices, and that the whole should be liable only to one simple percentage, abatement, or advance, whether it be determined by the Contract or the Warrant of the Public Board: and we also think the specified
<image src="S1V0003P0I0469"/>
<col>909</col>
Prices of Contracts entered into for a great variety of articles, ought to be revised and made proportionable to their current value, when circumstances will admit; this we conceive may always be done in time of peace, before the bidding for a new Contract takes place, instead of referring to a scale of disproportional prices in a former Contract, as, by that circumstance, none but those who have acted under the Contract, and are acquainted with the general consumption of the articles charged above or below their current value, can at all judge of the terms of their proposed Contract.&#x2014;It appears by the papers we required the Navy Board to lay before us, on the subject of an improved Block invented by Mr. John Garnett, and tried in his Majesty's Navy, that at the time of entering into this Contract, there was a great competition between Mr. Walter Taylor and Messrs. Garnett, Randall, and Brent, for supplying his Majesty's Navy with Blocks, and that many very respectable officers of his Majesty's Fleet had testified their fullest approbation of the Block invented by Mr. John Garnett, and had stated that it possessed a manifest superiority over any other Block they had ever seen. From amongst many other testimonies, equally strong, we have selected the following Report of a Survey held on Blocks of Mr. Garnett's invention, by order of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, on the 25th of March, 1791: viz.
<quote>"Magnificent, Spithead, 25t March, 1791.</quote>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01679">There is not any notice taken of a Patent in Mr. Walter Taylor's Contract; it has, however, been stated to us by his son, that
<col>910</col>
he had one, for an Improved Lignum Vit&#x00E6; Coaked Shiver, deliverable under his Contract; but as it has been represented to us by Mr. Dunsterville to have possessed no positive advantage over the old triangular Coaked Shiver, we conceive the Navy Board, instead of granting the increased prices on Mr. Taylor's several applications, had it in their power to have dissolved the Contract, if they had judged it expedient, and to have adopted the old triangular Coaked Shiver; or to have contracted with Messrs. Randall, Brent, and Garnett, for Blocks, considered by the officers of the Navy to have been very-superior to Mr. Taylor's.&#x2014;Our attention has naturally been directed to (he circumstance of the Navy Board's granting Mr. Walter Taylor considerable advances, notwithstanding he had entered into a Contract to supply his Majesty's Yards with Blockmaker's Wares for 7, 14, or 21 years, at specific prices; being inclined to believe, if there had been ever so great a fall in the prices of materials and labour, Mr. Taylor would have insisted on receiving the prices he had contracted for: on giving the subject our best consideration, we are not disposed to condemn, in all cases, the giving relief to individuals in their engagements with government, as we are of opinion the public concerns should be conducted on broad and liberal principles, conceiving a contrary practice might endanger the supplies in time of war, and be productive of evil; yet as it would open the door to great abuses, if too much encouragement was given to complaints on any small or temporary loss, we would recommend, that whenever it may be thought right by any of the naval departments, to increase a contractor's prices, instead of advertising for a new Contract, that the information which may justify the proposed increase be laid before the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, for their consideration and determination.&#x2014;It was stated to us, that had Mr. Taylor's demands been greater than they were, they most have been complied with, as it was unknown to the Navy Board that there was any manufactory, besides his, capable of supplying the Navy with Blocks: we lament that the public service should have been considered to be so circumstanced, and think the attention of the Navy Board, on Mr. Taylor's several applications for advances, mighty have been more advantageously directed, by enquiring of the several blockmakers the terms on which they were willing to serve government, than by confining its enquire to the increased price of labour and materials; the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0470"/>
<col>911</col>
propriety of allowing an advance on those considerations depending very much on the terms on which the Contract was originally made, and which we conceive to have been unfavourable to the public.&#x2014;Mr. Dunsterville has stated to us in his evidence, that the supply of Plymouth Yard had been in his family for a century, and that he would again have undertaken it at 5 per cent. under Mr. Walter Taylor's prices; and Mr. Thomas Fox has slated to us, that he was capable of supplying the Eastern Yards; and that one of his reasons for not entering into articles of partnership with Mr. Taylor, was, that he might have the opportunity of accepting a Government Contract, for which he was prepared, in case the Contract for supplying the King's Yards had been separated; and when it be recollected that lie for a considerable lime actually paid near 11 per cent. for permission to supply Chatham and Sheerness Yards at the prices granted by the warrants of the Navy Board, it might have been expected that his terms would at least have been as much under Mr. Taylor's as those stated by Mr. Dunsterville.&#x2014;On a review of the detail of the case, and of the evidence before us, we feel ourselves called upon to say, that his Majesty's Yards have not been so advantageously supplied with Blockmaker's Wares, as we think they might have been; it appearing in evidence, that during a great part of the time Mr. Walter Taylor held the Contract, Mr. Thomas Fox and Mr. Samuel Taylor were actually paying near 11 per cent. on the amount of their goods, for permission to supply Chatham and Sheerness Yards; that during the whole time of the Contract, they paid from 5 to 7 per cent. for permission to supply Deptford and Woolwich Yards; and from the 12th Feb. 1795, to the termination of the Contract in 1802, the allowance made by Mr. Bartholomew Dunsterville to Mr. Waiter Taylor, amounted to between 9 and lo per cent. on the whole amount of the supply of Plymouth Yard.&#x2014;We do therefore recommend, in case the Blocks are not manufactured by government, that the supplies of the different Yards be divided as they have been heretofore, and that engagements be entered into with those persons who actually furnish the supplies; for, besides the general impolicy of contracting with one person only for articles of great necessity to the state, and the suffering him to branch that Contract to his own advantage and the public loss, it must be evident, that the supplies of government will be more certain, by pursuing the practice we have recommend-

ed; for then, in case of the failure of one individual to perform his engagements, the demands on the others might be increased in the necessary proportion, and the public service thereby be prevented from being put to much inconvenience.&#x2014;It has been stated to us, that the clerks in the Navy Office, upon whose examination of the public accounts the fair expenditure of millions annually very much depends, have no other mode of gaining a knowledge of their several duties than from the communications of their predecessors, and from precedent; we think it cannot require much reasoning to shew the defect and impropriety of this practice, as by the inattention and neglect of one person, the best and wisest regulations may be wholly lost sight of: we do therefore recommend, that the secretaries, under the direction of the several committees, be ordered to draw up a Code of Instructions for each office, branching its duties to the several clerks; that these instructions be laid before the Navy Board, and, when revised and corrected, be established; and that additions be made thereto as occasion may require.&#x2014;We do not mean at present to call in question the advantages, or disadvantages which may have arisen from the arrangement of the several members of the Navy Board into committees; but we think the public service would be benefited, if the business of each committee was divided, so that each member might have the immediate superintendance of a separate branch thereof, the general direction resting, as at present, with the committee at large, giving to the sea officers and to the. surveyors of the navy, the departments most connected with their professions, and to the other members, those best suited to their knowledge and ability; for, besides the advantage of individual responsibility, it will afford to active and intelligent men an opportunity of arranging and consolidating the duties of the several branches of the office under their superintendance, so as to insure to the public permanent and lasting benefit: but, as the Comptroller of the Navy is invested with a general superintendance over all the departments, and has, besides, special duties to perform, we think he should not be included iu this arrangement.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01680">A CASE of gross fraud, committed under the Contract for the performance of Cooper's Work, and for the Supply of Cooper's Wares at His Majesty's Yard at Woolwich, having been, by order of the right hon. the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, laid before the Attorney General, it was recommended by him to be communicated to us.&#x2014;The nature of this fraud being fully set forth in the Representations of the Navy Board, and the case being now under the consideration of the law officers of the crown, to determine the mode of proceeding against the delinquents, we have not judged it necessary to employ our time in going more minutely into the enquiry&#x2014;On examining the Certificates for Goods delivered, containing the fraudulent charges, we discovered errors which it would be improper to pass without notice; we shall therefore make some observations on them, and then proceed to state the frauds which have been detected.&#x2014;The Contract for Cooper's Wares to be delivered at Woolwich Yards was held by Mr. William Gunton till the 25th of May 1745; upon his decease, a new Contract was entered into with his widow; and upon her death, the Contract was granted on the 28th Feb. 1782, at an advance of 35 per cent. on</p>

Young, Adams, and Corson, was 20 per cent.&#x2014;Other articles, not specified in the Contract, were at different times required for the service of the Yard; these Messrs.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01690">A reference to the Statement of Mr. Stephen Tadd, master mast-maker, and of Mr. Joseph Baker, master rope-maker, will shew other instances of similar impositions, the whole proving the facility with which such Frauds may be practised, the want of further checks for their prevention, and the necessity of a more careful examination of the accounts; for although the employing a Cooper in each of his Majesty's Yards, as proposed by the Navy Board, may prevent a recurrence of the abuses of which we have been speaking, yet it can hardly be supposed that mere accident had discovered the only instances in which Frauds of this nature have been committed.&#x2014;The difficulty of establishing effectual means to prevent Frauds and Abuses, must necessarily be in proportion to the want of exertion in the superintending power: we therefore recommend, in order to draw the attention of the officers more directly to the expence of the several Yards, that they be ordered to make out and forward annually to the Navy Board, an Abstract Account of the Yearly Expence of their respective Yards, made up to the 31st Dec.
<col>918</col>
under different heads: this Account should, we think, contain the annual expence of the nine preceding years, by which the officers would be led to make a comparison of the expences; and if there should appear to be an increase on any article, would naturally consider and enquire whether there had existed any cause for such increase, or whether it had grown out of abuse.&#x2014;To the amount of the certificates for goods delivered, made out at the several yards, we think the interest ought to be added, agreeable to the present mode of payment by ninety-day-bills, that the Abstract Accounts may embrace the whole amount of the expences of each yard.&#x2014;By comparing at the Navy Office the expences of the several Yards with each other, such Frauds as those practised under the Contract for Cooper's Wares would probably be discovered, and it would afford the Board an opportunity of seeing, at one view, the expences classed under the different heads, at each of the Yards; so that if any considerable increase, not borne out by the services performed, should appear, it would lead to enquiry, and probably to the detection of frauds.

Agency.&#x2014;The property of Prize, or Goods taken from an enemy, is well known to be a branch of the Royal Prerogative; but the bounty of the Crown has generally transferred it to the captors by proclamation: and the Distribution of Prize, the Proceedings in Prize Causes, the Disposition of the Capture while the Proceedings are pending, the appointing of Prize Agents, and their Conduct, have been regulated by acts of parliament, commonly called prize acts, passed soon after the commencement of hostilities. The duty of the Prize Agent is chiefly to be collected from these statutes, which are usually made to continue in force during the war, at the beginning of which they are passed, and no longer; except as to matters depending in judgment when hostilities cease, or brought into judgment in consequence of captures made during the war. The law on this subject may therefore be considered as occasional. From the stale of public affairs for some time past, it has been foreseen that the attention of the legislature might soon be applied to the framing of such a law. We have therefore diligently employed ourselves in endeavouring to obtain information on this subject, and we hasten to make known the result, at a period when such information may possibly be of use.&#x2014;We propose to adopt the following Order in this Report:&#x2014;First, to state the Practice, Duty, and Emoluments of a Prize Agent; then, the Irregularities, Abuses, and Frauds, to which the present mode of conducting the business gives opportunity and occasion; and lastly, to suggest such alterations as appear to us likely to prevent the mischiefs which attend the present system.&#x2014;From the examination of James Primrose Maxwell, esq. a Prize Agent of great experience, we received a clear and succinct account of the Practice of a Prize Agent, which we think it expedient to insert in his own words, referring to the sections of the Prize Act, which confirm his statement, and may serve to illustrate it:</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01695">"At the commencement of a war, and "upon the King's issuing a proclamation for "the distribution of Prize Money, it is the "practice of the officers and companies of "His Majesty's ships, on taking Prizes, and "sending them into port, generally to transmit a letter of attorney to one or more "persons to act as their agents, unless they "may have made such appointment previous to their proceeding to sea.&#x2014;By the "act of parliament*, a majority of each

"class of officers and men have a right to "appoint one or more agents; but they generally appoint the person recommended "by the captain.&#x2014;On the arrival of the" Prize in port, the agent takes possession, "and gets the preparatory examinations "taken, which are transmitted with the "ship's papers to the high court of Admiralty, directed to the registrar.&#x2014;The depositions taken are commonly those of the "master and the two next principal persons on board the Prize, on printed standing interrogatories prepared by the King's "Advocate. The examination at the outport is made in the presence of one of the "commissioners appointed by the Judge of "the High Court of Admiralty, and an Actuary appointed by the Registrar, who "examine the witnesses, through the medium of an interpreter, touching the particulars of the property of the ship, cargo, "and destination.&#x2014;The examinations are "delivered by the Registrar to the King's "Proctor, who follows the opinion of His "Majesty's Advocate, as to taking out a "monition, and commencing proceedings "against the captured vessel, and this examinant never knew an instance of a vessel's being proceeded against contrary to "the opinion of the King's Advocate&#x2014;At "the expiration of 20 days* from the issuing of the monition, giving notice to all "persons to make their claims, or as soon "after as the cause can be got ready for "trial, it is placed on a list for being heard "in its turn. If the capture should be a "ship of war, or decidedly the property of "the enemy, and no claim preferred, condemnation generally takes place in the "course of 6 weeks; but in regard to ships "claimed as neutral property, the proceedings are not so expeditious, depending "upon the nature of the case, residence of "the claimants, and the facility of obtaining "evidence to determine whether the property be neutral or otherwise.&#x2014;The Prize "remains undelivered in the port where "she arrives until condemned or released, "unless the court, upon representation by "affidavit of the perishable state of the cargo, grant a commission for the appraisement and sale thereof; but the ship is "never sold till after condemnation. If the "neutral claimant think proper to take the "property on giving security &#x2020;, he has a "right so to do, agreeably to the value settled by two appraisers named by commissioners appointed by the course one com-

Previous to May 1798, if no appeal were "preferred within 3 months after the condemnation, and the account of sales was "settled, which generally happened within "that time, the proceeds were divided "among the captors, but in May 1798*, an "act of parliament was passed, which extended the time for lodging appeals from "3 months to 12 in all cases whatever.&#x2014;By "the extension of the time for lodging appeals, the captors were not only kept out "of their Prize Money, but in some instances, I fear, claims have been lodged "for the purpose of delaying the distribution, and with a view to obtain a consideration from the captors to drop the appeal. It also affords the neutral claimant "opportunity to contrive and bring forward "fabricated evidence in support of his pretensions.&#x2014;In cases of appraisement and "sale of neutral cargoes, the proceeds are "remitted by the commissioners to the Registrar of the Court of Admiralty, to remain in his hands until final adjudication; "but after condemnation, if the claimant "chuses to appeal, and declines taking the "property on bail, the Captor's Agents &#x2020; "give security, dispose of the goods, and "keep the property in their hands until the "appeal is decided.&#x2014;After condemnation "(or final decree on appeal) the agents proceed to sell the Prize, and within a reasonable time afterwards (perhaps three or "four months) make up the accounts for "distribution to the captors, giving notice "twice in the London Gazette &#x2021; that the "Account of Sales would be lodged in the "Court of Admiralty. At the expiration "of 10 days from the first notice &#x00A7;, another "notification is inserted in the Gazette, that "payment will be made to the captors at a "certain time and place, not less than three "days from the date of the notification.&#x2014;If "the ship be in England, the payment is "made on board, and the Recalls fixed generally at the place where the agents reside.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01696">From this Account given by Mr. Maxwell, it will have been perceived, that the Business of a Prize Agent, which begins with the first arrival of a captured vessel in port, continues during the suit till acquittal or condemnation; in case of appeal, till final adjudication; and is not concluded, where the Prize is condemned, till after it has been distributed, and the unclaimed and forfeited shares have been paid over to the Treasurer of Greenwich Hospital.&#x2014;The Duties of a Prize Agent have already been touched upon in the Account given of his Practice; but we think it may be of service that we should introduce into this Report a more particular Statement of them. And we propose to do this by giving Extracts from those Clauses in the Prize Act, passed in the 33rd year of His present Majesty's reign, ch. 66th, which prescribed the Agent's duty during the last war.</p>

After the sale of any Prize, the Agent shall give public notification for the payment of the shares to the captors. If the Prize be condemned in the High Court, or other Court of Admiralty* <i>in Great Britain,</i> the agent shall publish such notification in the Gazette, or some other newspaper of public authority of the island or place where the Prize shall be condemned, and if there be no Gazette or such other newspaper published there, then in one of the most public newspapers of the island or place; and two of the Gazettes or newspapers containing such notification shall be delivered by the agent to an officer of the Customs, or Principal Officer of the Port or Place where the Prize shall be condemned. If there be no public newspaper in the island or place, the agent shall give in two written notifications under his hand. The officer receiving these notifications, shall subscribe them with his name, send one of them by the first ship to the Treasurer of Greenwich Hospital, or his Deputy, to be there registered, and keep the other in his custody. The agent shall insert in every such notification his place of abode, and the day of the month and year appointed for the payment of shares. These notifications, at home or abroad, shall be published in the manner directed 3 days at least before any share is paid. After these notifications, if any man's share remain in the hands of the agent belonging to men run from the service, or not legally demanded within three years, such shares shall be paid to the Treasurer of Greenwich Hospital.&#x2014;Sect. 57. The agent and officer of the Customs, or other officer offending against the preceding section, shall forfeit respectively 100l.&#x2014;Sect. 59. Agents, after the Sale of any Prize is completed, and before the time of the first payment of the Prize Money to be distributed, shall exhibit in the Court in which the Prize shall be condemned, or in the High Court of Admiralty, a Copy of their Accounts of Sales verified on oath, to be deposited in the Public Re-

<p id="S1V0003P0-01698">The provisions of the legislature, stated in the foregoing abstracts from the statute, have apparently two great objects in view; one, to notify and secure to a meritorious body of men the reward of their exertions and gallant actions; the other, to notify and secure to Greenwich Hospital, for the benefit of that noble charity, such shares of Prize and Bounty money, as by accident or neglect might remain unclaimed, or by desertion and other causes might become forfeited.&#x2014;The avowed emolument of a Prize Agent arises from his Commission, which is, generally speaking, 5 per cent. on the gross proceeds of Captures finally adjudged to be lawful Prize. If the goods taken be subject to heavy duties, the amount is sometimes deducted from the proceeds before the commission is charged. We say, the avowed emolument, because we understand this to be the only remuneration for his services, to which he is entitled by usage, where he does not make a special agreement with his employers; but there is a farther emolument enjoyed by him in many instances, which ought not to be permitted, and of which we shall speak further hereafter; namely, the use of the proceeds of Captures, to an enormous amount, which frequently remain in his

hands many years while Appeals are pending. There is reason to believe that he sometimes shares in the sum charged for brokerage, which we consider as improper. It has been stated to us by some of the agents whom we have examined, that the Commission is sometimes charged on the net proceeds; but we apprehend, that it is not the usual course, and seldom takes place except by agreement.&#x2014;Where the Capture is not adjudged Prize, the agent does not receive any commission nor any compensation for his trouble. In such cases he charges only his disbursements.&#x2014; The Commission above mentioned is not always received by one agent, or by those only who do the business. For the most part, two or move agents are appointed by the captors, who then share the commission, and it happens not unfrequently that a friend of the captain appointing the agent, and the secretary of the commander in chief, are named in the letter of attorney with the regular agent, and, by virtue of being so named, or by a private agreement with the efficient agent, participate in the commission without taking any part in the employment. The Agents whom we examined concurred in opinion, that their profits (so far as they arise from commission) would be increased if one agent, or two or more, being general partners, were appointed for every capture, with a commission of 2&#x00BD; per cent. instead of the commission of 5 per cent. subject to the drawbacks occasioned by the practice of appointing supernumerary and non-efficient agents.&#x2014; It will be proper to notice in this place, that agents making the sales, and superintending the business through the progress of the Prize Cause, until final adjudication, do not always make the distribution themselves, but employ inferior agents for that purpose; or, if they undertake the first distribution themselves, they sometimes employ the inferior agents to make the Recalls.</p>

<title>IRREGULARITIES, ABUSES, AND FRAUDS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01699">We now proceed to the head of Irregularities, Abuses, and Frauds.&#x2014;The mischiefs in the present system of Prize Agency, of which we have had proof in the course of this enquiry, fall under the description of Abuses and Irregularities, rather than Fraud. We find no reason for subjecting to general censure, or involving in general disrepute, the persons concerned
<image src="S1V0003P0I0478"/>
<col>927</col>
in this business; but we are satisfied that there exists a set of men, who take advantage of the unsuspicious character; of the indiscretion and extravagance which prevail among seamen, and who, in time of war, earn a scandalous livelihood by supplying them with liquor, clothes, and trifling sums, and getting from them wills and powers of attorney for their Prize Money.&#x2014;These men are chiefly to be met with at the ports, and consist of slop-sellers, publicans, and other persons of the lowest and worst condition. It would have been a waste of time to have employed ourselves in endeavouring to trace to detection instances of the Frauds practised by these people. It will be found from the Evidence that persons most conversant in Prize Concerns, have no doubt but that the evil exists, and requires a remedy; we apprehend that the men of whom we are speaking, and their practices, are very notorious.&#x2014;We have received, in the course of our enquiry, some representations respecting the inferior agents before noticed, as employed in making the Recalls, which place them in a point of view by no means respectable; but they originated from a quarter which has since appeared to us not entitled to much attention, namely, the narrative of a person who, when summoned before us, refused to give evidence.&#x2014;We have examined one of these Agents, who has been engaged many years in a most extensive wav in the business of Recalls, and we should not be justified if we were to impeach his integrity by any thing that has been proved before us; still we feel ourselves obliged to declare, that the mode of conducting this part of the business has been very loose and unsatisfactory, furnishes grounds for jealousy and suspicion, and might be made a cover for Fraud.&#x2014;It will tend to elucidate the sort of irregularities to which we here allude, if the nature and form of a Distribution List be first described. It is a book with the leaves divided into six parts or columns. The first division or column contains the names of the persons entitled to shares, arranged in classes, according to their rank; the second column shews the quality of the persons entitled; the third the amounts of their respective shares; the fourth, the time of the shares being paid; the fifth column is allotted to the signature of the party receiving; and the sixth to the name of the witness attesting the receipt. Lists of this sort are put into the hands of a Recall agent, where he is to
<col>928</col>
make the whole distribution; where a part distribution has already taken place, he is furnished with extracts from the lists containing the names, qualities, &amp;c. of those only whose shares remain unpaid.&#x2014;Stated days, twice a month, were fixed by him for the private Agents of seamen to attend. Upon these days it was usual for the private agents and attornies, or persons so representing themselves, to resort to the Recall agent, and (strange as it may appear) instead of giving in a list of the persons whose shares they profess to be entitled to receive, they were permitted to look through the Distribution List, and to sign their names in the fifth column as attornies for as many of the claimants as they thought proper. A few days after they called again, and then used to receive the amount of the shares for which they had signed, without producing any authority under which they acted, or pretended to act. Within three or four years past this practice was in some measure altered. The private agents or attornies were allowed at their first coming to sign the lists as before; but they were required to leave their authorities to be inspected by the Recall agent, who, upon their next coming, paid or withheld the shares for which they had signed, according as he was, or was not, satisfied with the authorities produced. Their signatures were not however erased from the Shares not paid them, but remained from an expectation (as it is alledged) that they might afterwards produce better authorities, and clear up the doubts which prevented their receiving the money in the first instance. It was stated, indeed, that these signatures were always erased when the time arrived for accounting with Greenwich Hospital, and that the Recall agent had the following check against their being mistaken for receipts, as they import; namely, that the signatures set against the shares actually paid (and those only) were attested by themselves, or one of their clerks, in the sixth column. It is obvious, that this mode of signing the lists for shares not received was likely to create errors, and was capable of being used as a cover for Fraud. This practice too was (it seems) reformed about 12 months ago; and the authorities are now left with the Recall agent to be compared with the Lists before the private agent or attorney is permitted to sign. Nevertheless, we have thought it proper to enter into a detail of this mode of signing the lists, because we have no means of as
<image src="S1V0003P0I0479"/>
<col>929</col>
Certaining whether the reform is general, unless we should bring before us every agent who pays Recalls; and though it were general, yet there is no security that the abuses which have existed in this branch may not at any time be renewed. In some of the lists which we examined, we observed in this fifth column, the signatures of persons not professing to be the immediate attornies to the parties interested: the Entries were in tins form; "A. B. for C. D. "Atty." The Recall agents are also in the habit of corresponding with the petty agents at the ports, who may be said to trade in Prize Money, and frequently debit themselves in the Distribution Lists as acting for them, charging a Commission of 2&#x00BD; per cent. The entry in the fifth column is then made in this form; "A. B. (the Recall "Agent) for C. D. Atty.;" or, "A. B. (the "Recall Agent) for C.D. on account of E. F. "Atty." It is apparent that the Recall agent sometimes surmises, that the money so paid over by him to persons having or pretending to have powers, does not reach the true owner. For it will be found in the Evidence of Mr. James Poulain, that he required Deeds of Indemnity from two persons to whom he and his partner were in the habit of making many payments for shares of Prize Money. One of these deeds which we inspected, was dated so late as the 17th of March 1802, and was made between Messrs. Poulain and Keys, and B. Hitchins, by the description of Navy Agent. &#x2014;It recited, That Messrs. Poulain and Keys had paid to the said B. Hitchins, several sums of money due to officers and seamen for proportions of Prize Money, the said B. Hitchins acting (as he alledged) as attorney or agent for such officers and seamen; but not producing at the times the powers whereby he, or the persons he represented, were empowered to receive, and farther that they were likely to pay him other sums in like manner, and might be called upon to pay the same over again. Then followed a Covenant of Indemnity against all such payments made since the 1st of Jan. 1793, and also against all such payments as should afterwards be made by them.&#x2014;When a List is about to be closed, preparatory to paying over the unclaimed shares to Greenwich Hospital, in which List any shares of officers remain unpaid, it appears to have been usual for the clerks of the Recall agent to give notice to such officers of their claims, and to receive for so doing a gratuity of 2&#x00BD; per cent. commis-
<col>930</col>
sion.&#x2014;That persons entitled to shares should be informed of it, is perfectly right.; but the fact is stated for the purpose of drawing the following inference. If it happen, even in a few instances, that officers are ignorant of such claims at the distance of 3 years and 3 months after the first distribution (the period allowed for the agents to pay over the unclaimed shares to Greenwich Hospital) surely it must happen in many cases that the inferior classes of seamen are not informed of their rights, and so they or their families lose the benefit belonging to them. Add to this, that the seaman's ignorance of his right is an incitement to the fraudulent practices before mentioned; namely, the receiving of his Prize Money by means of pretended powers.&#x2014;Another evil arising from irregularity may properly be noticed here. The powers of attorney given by seamen are frequently general, and extend to wages, prize, bounty money, &amp;c. due, or which may become due to them.&#x2014;The same power is often executed by many seamen, in some instances by as many as 200 or more, some claiming shares under some distributions, some under others. One reason assigned for these general powers, and for inserting so many names in one power, is, that if separate powers were given for every Prize, or distinct powers by every claimant, the cost of the power, upon which the stamp duty alone is 15<i>s.</i> would often exceed the money to be received. It is to be observed, that the powers so executed by many having distinct interests, with one stamp only, are not valid in law, and therefore should not be permitted. Yet we find, that not only the inferior agents, but those of the greatest respectability, and most extensive concerns, have been in the practice of paying to the persons appointed by them. We believe that this facility has often proceeded from a good motive, an unwillingness to delay or refuse payment to the seamen; but it should be remembered, that the observance of form and regularity is a protection against deceit; and that the neglect of such precautions leads to abuses. It is manifest that the illiterate are very likely to be imposed upon by these general powers; and it is not to be supposed that a sailor will consider much the contents or effect of a paper which he executes in concert with fifty or an hundred shipmates.&#x2014;. In giving an account of the Emoluments of a Prize Agent, we noticed that the commission was not wholly received by the efficient agent, but that others, not doing any
<image src="S1V0003P0I0480"/>
<col>931</col>
part or the business, shared his emoluments, who were either joined in the appointment, or had a secret understanding with him. This strikes us as an improper proceeding, not to be passed over without further notice. An evil may naturally be exacted to flow from it, namely, that the efficient agent, deprived by these means of such profit from his commission as would be a fair retribution for his labour, will seek an equivalent from other sources, and will be tempted to make good this drawback by improper charges to be deducted from the proceeds. On the other hand, if that which remains to the agent, after these defalcations, be a sufficient remuneration, it proves that the captors are charged unjustly with the Excess. Perhaps it may be said, that the real agent derives a considerable exclusive profit from the money in his hands, of which he has the use in cases of appeal, commonly for 3 years, and often for double that period; but surely this would be pleading one abuse as a palliative for another. The agent can have no claim to the use of this money. It was never meant as part of his profit. It sets his interest at variance with his duty; and for that reason, if there were no other, it should not be permitted to continue among the sources of his emolument. Strong suspicions have been entertained that among some of the agents abroad it has actually led to the basest treachery. Whether any thing so iniquitous as has been surmised can be justly imputed to this cause or not, there appear to be abundant reasons for not allowing the agents to have the use of the proceeds of Prizes to such an amount, and for so long a time, as was permitted in the late war. The property is in many instances too great to be trusted to an individual, especially if that individual be engaged in trade; and most of the Prize Agents abroad are merchants. They are tempted to speculate upon it; and we find that some of the most considerable among them have failed at different periods for very large sums. The principal Agency House in Jamaica, which is said to have been concerned in nine-tenths of the captures carried into that island during the last war, amounting in value to about 2,143,000l. sterling, has been very lately under pecuniary embarrassments; and at that time they were greatly in arrear to Greenwich Hospital for unclaimed shares, and had in their hands more than 197,000l. depending on Appeals, besides the Proceeds of Prizes
<col>932</col>
undistributed amounting to 95,000l. retained principally for the purpose of defraying the expences of the Appeals.&#x2014;Another Irregularity which we have had occasion to observe in the business of Prize Agents, is, that they have in many respects disregarded the directions of the statute passed for the regulation of their conduct (as before noticed) at the beginning of the last war.&#x2014; The 56th section, requiring public notification previous to the payment of shares, does not seem to have been generally regarded by the agents abroad. The mischief of this is, that one of the chief sources of information to Greenwich Hospital is lost; besides that, the means of acquiring knowledge of their claims are lessened with respect to sailors who happen to leave the station before distribution, and with respect to the representatives of those who die Without receiving their shares.&#x2014;The Accounts required by the 62d section to be furnished to the treasurer of Greenwich Hospital, within 3 calendar months after the day appointed for the first distribution, have in general not been sent, or if sent, have contained only an Account of the Net Proceeds, with the Amount of the Shares paid; and, till a late regulation adopted by the commissioners of the Hospital in Jan. last, the accounts required by the same section to be delivered at the time of paying over the money remaining in the Agent's hands, used to be stated in a defective and unsatisfactory manner, by no means agreeable to the directions or spirit of the law. In these imperfect accounts, no mention was made of the shares which had been paid, and the Statement of the Proceeds was in a general way, without any detail of the produce of the sales, or the particulars of the expences and charges.&#x2014;There is another part of the Agent's duty arising from this statute, which has almost uniformly been transgressed or evaded; we mean, the publishing of the Notification directed by the 56th section, before the payment of any shares. We find it to have been a very general practice for agents to pay shares, or advance money to the captors on the credit of them, without observing this previous step.&#x2014;One of the evils arising from this practice is, that the agents, particularly those abroad, as soon as any such advance has been made, open an account current with the party, and carry the sum which, upon distribution, may be due to him to his credit side in that account. In such cases, the sums carried to accounts current are entered as discharg-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0481"/>
<col>933</col>
ed, or paid in the Distribution Lists. There is great reason for believing that this Irregularity is the occasion of loss to Greenwich Hospital, and to the parties interested, or their representatives. This remark is justified by the case of Mr. Thomas Finch, late master's mate of the Regulus.&#x2014;Messrs. Willis and Waterhouse, Prize Agents at Jamaica, had advanced some money to Mr. Finch, and opened an Account with him; we called for and examined this account. The credit side contained entries of several sums as shares of Prize Money to which he was entitled; the debit side consisted of advances and payments on his Account, and a balance in his favour of 297l. Jamaica currency. Among the payments, there was charged a remittance of 100l. sterling, on his account, to Mr. W. E. Cook, a navy agent in London. Mr. Finch was killed in action on the 11th of July, 1798. His father, as his representative, received from the pay office his arrears of wages on the 31st of March, 1799, but knew nothing of his right to Prize Money. Three years and three months haying elapsed after the Distribution to this Ship, the forfeited and unclaimed shares were paid to the Treasurer of Greenwich Hospital, and the Account between him and Messrs. Willis and Water-house finally closed.&#x2014;It appears, therefore, that if this matter had not incidentally come before us, the balance above mentioned, as well as the sum remitted to Mr. Cook, would most probably have been lost to the public, as well as to the representative of the deceased, to whom both these sums have lately been paid.&#x2014;Mr. Devis, a clerk of Messrs. Willis and Waterhouse, stated in his evidence, that it was their practice upon settling their accounts with Greenwich Hospital, to pay over all balances in their hands, notwithstanding such balances might have been previously written off in the Distribution Lists as carried to Account Current. In the above instance of Mr. Finch, we found, upon examining the Lists of forfeited and unclaimed Shares for the Regulus, that it made no mention of his name.&#x2014; We are not disposed to believe, and we do not mean to assume that Messrs. Willis and Waterhouse, or their correspondent Mr. Cook, had any fraudulent intention in this transaction. An explanation of it, so far as it respects the accounts of Messrs. Willis and Waterhouse with Greenwich Hospital, is given by Mr. Devis, in his evidence; but the explanation is not quite satisfactory; and the case viewed in the most favourable
<col>934</col>
light, is an instance of Irregularity, which ought to be effectually guarded against in future.&#x2014;We were furnished with an instance of the payment of shares to officers, before any notification of distribution, in the evidence of Mr. Aubin. It there appears that the Requin was captured in 1795, and that the proceeds, amounting to 1500l. except the shares of the commander in chief and the junior admirals, which were paid without any previous notification of distribution, still remain undistributed, and not paid over to Greenwich Hospital. A material observation arises from this case. Mr. Aubin assigns, as a reason for not having made a general distribution, that he has not been able to obtain Prize Lists, owing to the ships of the Fleet entitled to share having been ordered on different stations, and the crews having been dispersed. Admitting this plea as an excuse for his not having distributed, it will hardly justify his withholding of the money from Greenwich Hospital; though, according to the strict letter of the law, the duty to pay over unclaimed shares does not arise till 3 years after notification of distribution. We apprehend, that the treasurer of the Hospital, under the particular circumstances of this case, might and would have received this prize money at the end of three years from the condemnation of the capture; but, if we are mistaken in this, the law, limiting the period from notification of distribution, requires some alteration or addition. It cannot be admitted, in any case, that difficulties in proceeding to distribution should enable the agent to hold the money against the captors and the Hospital.&#x2014;This Irregularity in paying or advancing shares of Prize Money before Notification of Distribution, and that not partially, but to the seamen as well as officers, is farther instanced in the evidence of Mr. Brouncker, according to whose account, it seems to be a general practice with the Prize Agents in the East Indies. Probably it has arisen from a circumstance stated by him, namely, that there was not any Vice-Admiralty Court, or other court there, which had cognizance of Prize Concerns, and the captors were obliged to send home the the papers and instructions for Condemnation in the High Court of Admiralty. The delay is, of course, very considerable between the capture and condemnation.&#x2014;The time allowed for registering Letters of Attorney by agents, appears to us unnecessarily long. In 6 months after condemnation, they may be expected to have performed the greatest part of their duty,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0482"/>
<col>935</col>
except in cases of appeal; and the time most proper for giving public notice of their employment, seems to be at the first outset. If it be said, that they may not always be provided with powers of attorney in the first stage of the business, it may be answered, that, as notoriety is the object, they might be directed, instead of registering their powers of attorney, to make an entry with the Registrar of their names, their places of abode, the captors employing them, and the prize, before they take any step in the cause.&#x2014;In the evidence of Mr. Bate, the deputy treasurer of Greenwich Hospital, an inconvenience is stated to have arisen from the agents abroad having the option of paying the forfeited and unclaimed Shares to the Treasurer of Greenwich Hospital, or to his deputies abroad. If the Plan hereafter recommended, by which we propose to secure more effectually the interests of the Hospital, should not be adopted, it will be proper that this option should be done away, and that the agents abroad should be obliged to make these payments to the deputy treasurers on the spot.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01700">We have now closed our account of those instances of Abuses, Irregularities, and Defects, in the present system, which have appeared to deserve notice in the course of our enquiry. If it should be thought that they are less numerous, or less important than might have been expected, it may be observed, that it is an extremely difficult and invidious task to draw a discovery of incorrect or illegal transactions from parties interested or concerned in them; and that the statute from which our powers are derived, discountenances enquiries which tend to make the parties examined criminate themselves, or to expose them to pains or penalties.&#x2014;The same observation applies, if it should be objected, that our enquiry has not led to a copious disclosure of gross and abominable Frauds practised upon sailors with respect to their Prize Money; besides, it should be remembered, that many of the frauds by which they suffer, do not so much arise in the business of Prize Agency, as in the tricks and impositions of persons not engaged in that business, and consequently not within the scope of our enquiry. Still the general complaint, that sailors are often cheated by anticipation of all their future Prize Money, leads us to suggest, that possibly this might in some measure be presented, if it were enacted, that no Transfer by Deed, Will, or otherwise, or Agreement for a Transfer of any share of Prize Money, executed or made before Notifica-
<col>936</col>
tion of Distribution of the Prize, upon any consideration whatever, should be valid. By such a provision, the sailor would at least have an opportunity of knowing the amount of what he gives in exchange for what he receives; and if such a law should be objected to as a new attempt to restrain the freedom of alienation, it may be answered, that the restraint is temporary, calculated to protect the sailors' interest, and at all events would not obstruct the title of his next of kin, if he should happen to die before notification.&#x2014; Whether this restraint should be general, or limited, as to the classes of men, or amount of Prize Money to be affected by it, would be a consideration fit for the legislature, if a law of this sort should be thought adviseable; our design in this suggestion is to point out a mode of protection for the petty officers, seamen, and marines.</p>

<section>
<title>PLAN OF A GENERAL FRIZE OFFICE.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01701">The remainder of this Report will be employed in proposing Remedies for the Evils before noticed. It is not a new idea that a General Prize Office established by government would be an institution of public utility. Such an institution has been thought necessary by many persons well versed in Prize Affairs, and by some naval characters of great talent and respectability. It appears to us the only plan from which the abolition, or effectual reform of the Irregularities and Abuses in the present system of Prize Agency, can reasonably be expected.&#x2014;We have therefore directed our thoughts to the Formation of such an Office, the Regulations by which it should be governed, the Expences which would probably attend the Establishment, and the Funds by which those Expences might be defrayed. The Plan proposed by us is as follows:&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>1. That a Prize Office should be established in London, under the management of three commissioners, who should have agents or correspondents at Plymouth, Portsmouth, and Sheerness, and at Yarmouth, if occasion should require: the Expence of which establishment should be provided for in the manner hereafter mentioned.</li>
<li>2. That one Agent only, or two or more, being general partners in businesss, should be appointed to manage the interests of the captors, to be nominated by the ship actually making the capture: and that no person should receive any part of the commission charged by agents, or derive any benefit
<image src="S1V0003P0I0483"/>
<col>937</col>
therefrom, except the persons who should "<i>bon00E1; fide</i>" act as such in the real management of the business. And that every Prize Agent allowing of such participation, and every person so participating, should respectively forfeit 500l. for every such offence.</li>
<li>3. That before a Prize Agent be allowed to act, he should give security in the High Court of Admiralty at home, or in the Courts of Vice Admiralty abroad, in the sum of 5000l. for the due discharge of the trusts reposed in him; and in every suit at the time of commencing proceedings in the High Court of Admiralty, or Vice Admiralty Courts, he should give in his name and place of abode to the Registrar of the Court, which should be regularly transmitted every three months by the Registrar to the Commissioners for Prizes, with the names of the capturing and captured vessels, and an account of all Decrees given in Prize Causes within that period, whether of acquittal or condemnation.</li>
<li>4. That the Commission of Agency be 5 per cent. upon the Net Proceeds, to be appropriated as hereafter directed.</li>
<li>5. That where no Appeals shall be entered against the Condemnation of Prizes at home, and the Agent should not make Distribution within six months from the time of such condemnation, the amount of the Proceeds should be paid over to the Commissioners for Prizes, unless, upon a representation from the agent to the Commissioners, the proceeds should be permitted to remain in his hands for a longer period, not exceeding three months.</li>
<li>6. That where no Appeals shall be entered abroad, if the agent should not make distribution within nine months from the time of condemnation, the proceeds should be remitted to the Commissioners for Prizes, for the purpose of making distribution.</li>
<li>7. That all remittances should be made in government bills, if obtainable at the time when the agents may have occasion to remit.</li>
<li>8. That if the Agent make the distribution at home, within the time before specified, he should pay over the unclaimed shares to the Commissioners for Prizes at the expiration of one month from the time of distribution, and likewise 1 per cent. of the commission of 5 per cent. charged; and deliver a detailed account of the proceeds, together with the original Prize List, and a Copy of the Distribution List.</li>
<li>9. That if the Agent abroad make distribution within nine months from the time of
<col>938</col>
condemnation, he should remit to the commissioners for Prizes, within four months from the time of distribution, the amount of the unpaid and forfeited shares, together with 1 per cent. of the commission of agency, and transmit at the same-time a detailed Account of the Proceeds, the original Prize List, and a Copy of the Distribution List verified upon oath.</li>
<li>10. That the money paid by the agent to the Prize Office in cases not appealed, be lodged in the Bank, to be taken out by order of the Commissioners for Prizes, as occasion may require, for Distribution or Recalls.</li>
<li>11. That if the Agents, at home or abroad, should not make the Distribution within the times before specified for them respectively, then the Prize Office should make distribution, deducting the 5 per cent. commission as aforesaid, with the usual charges for advertisements, and distribution, as now made by the agents; and, when distribution shall have been made, the Prize Office should pay the agent 2&#x00BD; per cent. of such commission.</li>
<li>12. That in cases of appeal from the decisions of the High Court of Admiralty, the proceeds be paid over by the agent to the Commissioners for Prizes, within four months from the time of condemnation, if the appeal should be entered within that time; and if the appeal should not be entered within that time, then within one month from the time of entering the appeal; unless, upon cause shewn by the agent, the commissioners should enlarge the time for such proceeds being paid over, for a period not exceeding two months; such proceeds to be by them immediately invested in the 3 per cent. consolidated Bank Annuities, if the books of that fund be then open, and if not, then in the 3 per cent. Reduced Annuities, in the names of the Commissioners for Prizes, with such descriptions as may keep the Accounts of the Proceeds of each capture distinct, after a sufficient sum for defraying the expences of the suit, to be judged of by the commissioners, shall have been advanced by them to the agent for the captors, he giving security for the same; and if the agent be dissatisfied with the sum proposed to be advanced by the commissioners, the High Court of Admiralty, upon application by the agent, should decide the amount of the money to be advanced.</li>
<li>13. That further sums, if judged necessary by the commissioners, should, be ad-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0484"/>
<col>939</col>
vanced to the agents in the progress of the Appeal, out of the money so invested, or the interest arising therefrom.</li>
<li>14. That the Commissioners for Prizes, from time to time, should receive the dividends, and vest the same in the funds for the benefit of the parties in whose favour the appeal shall be decided.</li>
<li>15. That at the time of paying over or remitting the proceeds, the agent should deliver the original Prize Lists of the ships entitled to share, and a detailed Account of the Sales, verified upon oath.</li>
<li>16. That in cases of appeal from the decisions of the Vice Admiralty Courts abroad, the agents should remit the amount of the Net Proceeds, after deducting the expences of sale and condemnation, as soon as may be, not exceeding six months from the time of such appeal being entered, by bills of exchange payable to the Commissioners for Prizes, together with the original Prize Lists of the ships entitled to share, and a detailed account of the sales, verified upon oath. And if the agents should wilfully, or without sufficient reason, retain the money beyond the period above specified, he should be liable to a penalty of 500l. besides one per cent. per mensem for such time as he shall hold the money in his hands, to be paid to the party or parties who shall eventually be entitled to the proceeds.</li>
<li>17. That upon the money being received by the Commissioners for Prizes, such sums as may be judged necessary by the commissioners shall be advanced to the correspondent of the agent, to defray the expence of prosecuting or defending the appeal.</li>
<li>18. That upon all remittances made to the Prize Office from the agent, he shall at the same time communicate the name and place of abode of his correspondent or agent in England.</li>
<li>19. That the amount of the proceeds, when received by the commissioners, should be invested in the Funds as before provided for in cases of appeal from the decisions of the High Court of Admiralty.</li>
<li>20. That in appealed cases, the amount of the proceeds having been paid to the Commissioners for Prizes, the Distribution and Recalls should be wholly made by the Prize Office, and the agent should receive 3 per cent. on the net proceeds.</li>
<li>21. That captains or commanders of his Majesty's ships and vessels, on quitting any of the foreign stations before distribution be made, may direct the proceeds of Prizes, or, in cases of joint captures, the proportions of their respective ships to be remitted
<col>940</col>
to the Commissioners for Prizes, with the Account of the Proceeds, and the original Prize Lists; and in such cases, distribution should be made by the Commissioners for Prizes, and. the agent should be allowed 2&#x00BD; per cent. commission.</li>
<li>22. That all Recalls be made by the Commissioners for Prizes, who shall deliver accounts to the Treasurer of Greenwich Hospital of the unclaimed and forfeited shares, and pay over the amount at the expiration of the time now allowed.</li>
<li>23. That captains or commanders of his Majesty's ships or vessels transmit to the Prize Office an Account of Captures made by them, mentioning the agent to whom they shall be consigned, with his place of abode, the date of the capture, and where taken, and the names of the ships entitled to share for such capture.</li>
<li>24. That the Prize List sent to the agent contain the signature of the lieutenants and signing officers, and the ages and description of the persons entitled to share in the capture, to be taken from the Description Book, with an alphabetical list of the names affixed to it.</li>
<li>25. That the Agents should not send Accounts of Proceeds and Distribution Lists, as heretofore, to Greenwich Hospital, but to the Commissioners for Prizes, in the manner above directed.</li>
<li>26. That the paying or receiving of any share of Prize Money, before Notification of Distribution, should subject the agent paying, and the party receiving, to certain penalties; and that upon accounting with the Commissioners for Prizes, no deduction be made by the agent from the shares of Prize Money on account of money advanced by him; but that the full amount of the unpaid and forfeited shares should be paid over to the Commissioners for Prizes.</li>
<li>27. That no payment of shares to commissioned or warrant officers be allowed by the Commissioners for Prizes, other than such shares as shall be discharged in the Distribution Lists by payment to parties, or their orders, or lawful attornies, or the legal representatives of such officers deceased, or persons duly authorized by them; and that no payment to such officers, entered in such Distribution Lists as carried to account current, shall be deemed a legal discharge.</li>
<li>28. That the shares of Prize Money due to petty officers, seamen, and marines, be paid to the party, or person authorized by his order to receive the same, which order shall specify the name of the particular prize or distribution (should the distribution be
<image src="S1V0003P0I0485"/>
<col>941</col>
for more than one prize) and shall contain a full description of his person, signed by the captain, and one other signing officer of the ship in which the party shall be then serving; or, if discharged from the service, then the order shall be witnessed by the minister and churchwardens of the parish in which he may reside; which order, being admitted and paid, shall remain with the Commissioners for Prizes, or agents paying the same; and shall be in the following form:&#x2014;</li></ol>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01715">These are the general outlines for the Establishment of the proposed Prize Office.
<col>944</col>
We do not pretend to lay down rules for every minute part of the business that will necessarily arise in giving motion to such an Institution. Suitable arrangements, as occasion may require, will be made by the Commissioners; some difficulties may occur at the outset, but none, we conceive, that may not easily be surmounted.&#x2014;From the extent and magnitude of the trusts and duties to be reposed in the Commissioners, it will be of great importance that persons duly qualified should be selected to fill these situations; integrity, responsibility, and habits of business, will be essential requisites. An intimate knowledge of the business of Prize Agency in particular would be very desirable, at least in some of those who should first be appointed.&#x2014;We apprehend that many considerable advantages will result from such an institution. The Office will be a Place of Registry, to which all persons connected with Prize Concerns may apply for information, and learn the state of the captures in which they are interested. This will be matter of great advantage to the seamen, who, according to the present system, frequently lose Prize Money for want of knowing where to get such information, particularly in Cases of Prizes condemned abroad: the difficulties which they meet with in this respect are to be reckoned among the causes which lead them to sell their claims for the most trifling considerations. And it should be observed, that from the connexion of the Office with the ports of the greatest resort, this useful information will be placed as much as possible within their reach.&#x2014;Another advantage will be this; the Proceeds of Prizes now suffered to remain with the Agents at the risk of the captors, unproductive both to them and the claimants, and sometimes (as we have seen) lost by the failure of the agents, would be remitted lo the office in a reasonable time, and thereby secured. When they are vested in the Funds, they would not only be secured, but also rendered productive for those who should be ultimately entitled, whether it be the captors, the claimants, or Greenwich Hospital. In Cases of Appeal long depending, there would be an accumulation of interest, which might serve to meet the Expences of Sale, Commission, and Law Charges; add to this, that the public also would derive some benefit by the investing of so much money in the funds in time of war.&#x2014;If it should be apprehended, that the persons now engaged
<image src="S1V0003P0I0487"/>
<col>945</col>
in the Business of Prize Agency will be injured by the Establishment of such an office, it should be observed, that they will continue to be employed in the greatest part of the business as before, in the Sales, the Proceedings to Condemnation, the Distribution in many Instances, and in Appeals.&#x2014;The Captors will have the choice of whom they shall employ in all these branches. Several agents, indeed, will not be employed for any one capture; but this rather affects the privileges of the different classes of officers and seamen, than the agents: and we understand that the Privilege was seldom exerted by the inferior classes, who usually adopted the agent nominated by the captain.&#x2014;The commission proposed to be allowed the Agents for their services, exceeds that which they at present obtain, according to their own statement. Those whom we have examined generally agree, that upon an average according to the present system, they do not receive a Commission of more than 2&#x00BD; per cent. and some of them rate it lower. According to the plan proposed, they will receive 4 per cent. in all cases where they make Distribution; 2&#x00BD; per cent. where they do not make Distribution, in cases not appealed; and 3 per cent. in all appealed cases. It is true, that sometimes the trouble of an appeal may exceed that of a first distribution, and it may be asked upon what principle we have allotted a less commission to the former. It might be answered, that 3 per cent. commission would be an ample remuneration in the first case, and the additional 1 per cent. is proposed as a stimulus to diligence and dispatch. The truth is, that it is not by the comparison of one allowance with another that a fair judgment can be formed. It is only by looking at an average profit upon the whole business for a given time that the agent can fairly calculate whether his gains be sufficient We conceive there would be no danger of their proving otherwise upon such a computation.&#x2014;We deem it unnecessary to make any apology for proposing to take from them die use of the money while appeals are pending. This was never reckoned among their authorized emoluments. It sets their interest (as we have before remarked) in direct opposition to their duty; and if the former has not been sometimes preferred (as it has been surmised) the temptation to such a breach of duty, and the danger arising from speculation on such Funds, should be done away.&#x2014;If the Establishment be objected to as an Increase of Patronage,
<col>946</col>
and attended with great expence, we should submit, that patronage cannot be conferred or allowed for a more important object in this country than the protection of the seaman's interests; and if the expences of the office appear alarming, it should be noticed that we have judged it right to compute them on a high scale, thinking it better to err (if at all) on the side of excess. At the same time we are led to hope and believe, from the best calculations we can make, that the funds proposed to be set apart for the supply of those expences will not prove deficient. On the first opening of the establishment, an advance from government will be necessary, which may be repaid as soon as the Funds begin to be productive. And it may deserve the consideration of the legislature, whether, in the many cases of Appeals still remaining unheard, the proceeds now lodged in the hands of agents might not, after a proper notice, and reasonable time allowed for calling them in, be rendered subservient to the purposes of the institution.&#x2014;One topic only remains to be noticed; a topic which, in some respects, is perhaps not less important than any that have preceded An institution of this sort will necessarily tend greatly to check and correct the Frauds and Forgeries practised for the obtaining of Prize Money by wills, general powers of attorney, and orders. It would be in vain to hope that impositions on seamen should be wholly abolished by this or any other institution. But if by securing their property till the amount of it be ascertained; by giving them ready information of their rights, and rendering detection of fraud more easy, such an establishment should lessen, in any great degree, the opportunities of fraudulent practices, it must necessarily tend to reduce the number of those who seek a livelihood by them.

<image src="S1V0003P0I0488"/>
<col>947</col>
the Reign of his present Majesty, intituled, An Act for appointing Commissioners to enquire and examine in to any Irregularities, Frauds, or Abuses, which are or have been practised by Persons employed in the several Naval Departments therein mentioned, and in the Business of Prize Agency, and to report such Observations as shall occur to them for preventing such Irregularities, Frauds, and Abuses, and for the better conducting and managing the Business of the said Departments, and of Prize Agency, in future."</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01719">THE original and principal duty of this department is to collect a considerable part of the revenue of Greenwich Hospital, arising from a Deduction of Sixpence per month from the wages of seamen employed in the merchant's service; to which has been added, the collection of one moiety of the wages of men deserting from ships in the African trade, and other forfeitures and penalties; and also the receipt of the wages of men dying in the West India trade.&#x2014;Having pursued our Enquiries into the various topics above enumerated, in the order in which the several duties have been successively imposed on the office, we proceed, in the same manner, to relate the result, and offer such observations as have occurred in the course of our investigation; and to propose such alterations as may tend to encrease the revenue of Greenwich Hospital, and promote the interests of indigent individuals.&#x2014;The deduction of 6d. per month from the wages of seamen in the merchant service was first established by an act, passed in the 7th and 8th of the reign of his Majesty King William III. for the better support of Greenwich Hospital.&#x2014;In the following year it was further enacted, for the better levying and collecting the said duty, That all masters or commanders of merchant vessels should be examined, upon oath, as to the number, rates, salaries, wages, and times of service, of all and every person or persons belonging to or serving in such vessels.&#x2014;In the 10th year of the reign of her Majesty Queen Anne, the right hon. the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty were empowered, by an act of the legislature, to appoint a receiver or receivers, for the better collection of the said duty; such receiver or receivers to have power to depute the officers of the customs, or such other persons as they shall think fit, to collect the duty at the Out-ports of Great
<col>948</col>
Britain and Ireland; and the officers of the Customs, if so appointed, are required to collect the same, with such allowance for their trouble as the lords of the Admiralty should judge reasonable.&#x2014;By an act of the 2d year of the reign of his late Majesty, the collection of the duly was extended to the Islands of Jersey, Guernsey, Aldemey, Sark, and Man, and to the colonies, islands, and dominions, in America; but the collection, of this duty has not been extended to Gibraltar, or other places within the Mediterranean.&#x2014;The former acts, requiring the duty o be paid within 14 days from the ships being cleared inwards at the Custom-House, having been found ineffectual, it was enacted, That no Merchant's Ship should be cleared Inwards at the Custom-House until the master, commander, or owner, should produce a certificate of his having paid the duty, under a penalty of 20l. upon the master or owner and officers of the Customs respectively.&#x2014;By virtue of the authority vested in the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, by the statute of the 10th of Q. Anne, a permanent Establishment was fixed for the collection of this duty about the year 1714, which has continued with very little variation to the present period.&#x2014;On entering into the investigation of this department, we issued precepts for such papers and accounts as we judged necessary to obtain a knowledge of the duties required of the several officers, and also of the nature and extent of the receipt and expenditure of the office.&#x2014;We likewise issued our precept to the First Commissioner and Receiver, requiring his attendance, with which he was unable to comply, being confined by severe indisposition; and the other commissioners residing at a considerable distance from London, we were obliged to have recourse to Mr. Chas, Eve, first clerk to the receiver, and Mr. Charles Stanbridge, clerk to the accountant, for the information we wanted.&#x2014;The present Establishment consists of 3 commissioners; the first, in addition to his general duly as a commissioner, is, by his appointment, directed to execute the office of Receiver of the Port of London; the second commissioner has no particular duty assigned to him by his appointment, though in the records of the office he is styled Accountant. No instructions for the guidance of either of these officers in the collection of the Sixpenny Duty can be found in the office, although, in an ancient warrant, General Instructions are referred to, bearing date the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0489"/>
<col>949</col>
13th of Jan. 1714.&#x2014;As we concluded these instructions must have originated with the Lords of the Admiralty, we applied for a copy thereof; but they reported to us, that, upon a strict examination of the books of that office to a remote period, it did not appear that any General Instructions had been given to those officers for the regulation of their conduct.&#x2014;The third commissioner is appointed specifically Comptroller of the Accounts of the Receiver, and, by his Instructions, is required "to attend at all usual office hours in the head office in the port of London, together with the Receiver, and to keep a constant account of ail sums of money received by him there, making up the accounts with the several masters of vessels at the same time, and entering them in a fair book; and he is empowered to examine upon oath any master or other person whatsoever, making payments of the said Sixpence a month, touching the number and times of service of all and every person belonging to the ships or vessels, or any matter relating thereto.&#x2014;He is also to take an account of all bills remitted to the Receiver from the out-ports, and to inspect the accounts of the said Port Receivers, returned from time to time, from the Accountant, and to see that they do duly, and in time, remit the balance of their several accounts: He is also to examine the Receiver's yearly accounts, when prepared by him to be laid before the Auditor, and with the Accountant, to certify to the Auditor the charge upon the Receiver."&#x2014;However painful it may be to us to censure the mode in which the business of this office has been conducted, we hold it to be our duty not only to state the actual Abuses which may be found to exist in any of the Departments to which our Enquiries are directed, but to point out the Irregularities that may arise from a negligent superintendence, or a total dereliction of the duties required of principals; conceiving, that where the Heads of an office are generally negligent, there will seldom be found much diligence or attention in those acting under them.&#x2014;It appears from the result of our examination, that the appointments of the Commissioners for the Receipt of the Sixpenny Duty have been considered little otherwise than as sinecures; that the duties of the Commissioners, particularly of the second and third, have been chiefly performed by Mr. Charles Eve, first clerk to the Receiver, and Mr. Charles Stanbridge, clerk to the Accountant; and
<col>950</col>
that, since the indisposition of the late Mr. Rashleigh the Receiver, who resided at the office, the whole direction and management of it has been left to Mr. Eve.&#x2014;The second Commissioner resides at Tapley in Devonshire, and having seldom attended at the office, the performance of his duty has consequently been entirely entrusted to his clerk. The appointment of the third Commissioner and Comptroller, which is now held by one of the Esquire Beadles of the University at Cambridge, where he resides, has been made a perfect sinecure; and the important Checque the Comptroller was intended to be upon the Receiver has been rendered void by his non-attendance&#x2014;The form even of the checque, for which his office was instituted, has not been kept up, the duties of his clerk, as well as his own, having been performed, during the last twenty years, by the clerks to the Receiver and Accountant, subordinates to the very persons whose conduct he was appointed to control; and the salary allotted to the Comptroller's clerk has been received by them, although a nominal clerk has been regularly borne on the establishment, and the salary charged in the accounts of the Receiver, as paid to him.&#x2014;It is stated by Mr. Eve, that in the last year the Commissioners have not assembled once; that the Receiver and the Accountant have met at the office in that period about seven or eight times; and that the Comptroller has been there, within the year, about six times; but then only for the purpose of signing papers.&#x2014;By virtue of the statutes of the 10th of Queen Anne, and the 2d of George II. the commissioners appoint Deputy Receivers at the Several out-ports of Great Britain and Ireland, and in his Majesty's colonies, islands, and dominions in America, who are selected from the officers of the customs; and upon the conduct of those abroad a considerable checque has been established by the Board of Customs, withholding the payment of their salaries, unless they produce a certificate from the commissioners of the Sixpenny Office, that they have regularly accounted to them for the monies received.&#x2014;The allowance made to the Deputy Receivers for their trouble in the collection is 12&#x00BD; per cent. The commissioners have no authority for making this allowance, but it is reasonable to suppose it was contained in their original instructions, which have been lost; as, by the records of the office, the commission does not appear to have been altered since the first institution.&#x2014;The receipt of the Deputy Receivers
<image src="S1V0003P0I0490"/>
<col>951</col>
in the West Indies and America are checqued by the Plantation Clerkin the Custom-House in London, for which an allowance is made to him of 10 per cent. upon the net amount of the collection; and the Secretary to the Commander in Chief at Newfoundland is employed to receive the Sixpenny Duty collected by the deputies there, upon which he has an allowance of 7&#x00BD; per cent.&#x2014;The commission of 12&#x00BD; per cent. upon a small receipt, may not be more than adequate to the trouble; but at the principal ports, where the collection is large, it amounts to a sum very much beyond what we consider to be a reasonable compensation.&#x2014;The emolument derived by the Deputy Receiver at Liverpool from the percentage allowances on the monies collected under the direction of the Sixpenny Office, amounted in the year 1800 to the sum of 1,081l. 16s. 10d. and on an average of the last three years to 977l. 14s. 9d. and as the commission on the receipt of the wages of men dying in the West India trade, soon after the passing of the act in 1797, for the forfeiture of the same to the use of the Merchant Seamens Hospital, was reduced at the ports of Liverpool and Bristol from 12&#x00BD; to 5 per cent. on account of the largeness of the emolument, we can see no good reason why the commission on the receipt of monies payable to Greenwich Hospital should have been continued at 12&#x00BD;per cent. particularly at Liverpool.&#x2014;We therefore recommend, as no permanent percentage allowance can be fixed, owing to the variation in the receipt of the different ports, that the rate of commission allowed the Deputy Receivers be revised annually by the commissioners, and such alterations as they may judge necessary, submitted to the Lords of the Admiralty for their directions. The percentage allowance so granted, we think, ought not to exceed the sum of 500l. per annum to any one Receiver; and this, we trust, will be deemed a fair and adequate compensation, especially when it be considered, that this allowance is in addition to the emoluments derived from appointment under the Board of Customs.&#x2014;The statute of the 8th and 9th of William III. 10th of Q. Anne, and 2d of George II. direct, That all and every master, commander, or owner of merchant vessels, liable to the Duty of Sixpence per month payable to Greenwich Hospital, shall be examined upon oath as to the number, rates, salaries, wages, and times of service, of all and every person and per sons belonging to or serving in such ships or vessels; and sufficient power is given by the
<col>952</col>
act to the Receiver or Receivers, or their Deputies, to administer the same.&#x2014;Although the Commissioners, in their instructions to the Deputy Receivers, direct this regulation to be adhered to, and furnish them with a form, in which the accounts of the crews shall be rendered by the masters; yet this very proper and necessary regulation has been very much neglected at the office in London, though under the immediate inspection of the Commissioners; and the masters have generally been required to state only the number of men for which they were willing to pay the duty, to the truth of which an affidavit has seldom been administered. Mr. Stanbridge states, that where there has been an appearance of Fraud, the masters have been asked by the clerks, if they could make oath to their accounts; but an oath has never been administered, as the clerks have no authority for that purpose.&#x2014;Having required of the commissioners a detailed account of the establishment of the office, with the amount of the annual receipt of each individual, by salaries, fees, perquisites, and emoluments, a statement was delivered to us, similar to that presented to the Committee of Finance in 1797. In the column for fees was written "No established "Fees;" and in the column of "Total Receipt of each individual," the amount of the salaries only was placed against each name, which would appear to have been intended to convey an idea that no fees were taken; but on our enquiring whether any fees, though not established, were received, we discovered that certain fees were taken by the first clerk from masters of vessels paying the Sixpenny Duty, upon the plea of dispatching their business, and also gratuities on the payment of wages to the representatives of men dying in the West India trade, as well as for those forfeited to the Merchants Seamens Hospitals, which, on an average of the last four years, have amounted in the whole to about 390l.&#x2014;We conceive the receipt of fees will generally lead to abuse; and as we find that the production of the necessary documents has been dispensed with, which ought to have been furnished by persons paying the Sixpenny Duty, whereby the interest or Greenwich Hospital may have been prejudiced, we recommend their being immediately abolished, and that no fee whatever be taken by any person belonging to this office: but, we are of opinion, that the salaries to the officers and clerks should be made adequate to the duties required, and the trust reposed in them.&#x2014;The sums paid

into Greenwich Hospital by the Receiver on account of the Sixpenny Duly, during the last 13 years, have been as follows; viz.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01720">We caused to be laid before us an Account, rendered annually by the Sixpenny Office to the Admiralty, of the Number of Seamen employed in the Merchants Service, who had paid the Sixpenny duty between the years 1790 and 1802; but upon examination of it, we found it unsatisfactory from two causes: first, the numbers stated being ascertained by reducing the gross amount of the duty received into shillings, and dividing them by 6, the proportion that would be paid by one man, if constantly employed during the year, it merely gives a number which would, if so employed, pay to that amount; and, secondly, because we discovered that it had been the practice to include in the gross amount of the Sixpenny duty, the moiely of run mens wages in the African trade, and other forfeitures and penalties collected at the out-ports.&#x2014;We therefore subjoin a Copy of the Account; and in an additional column, have given the number of Seamen that ought to have been returned, according to the mode of calculation above described.</p>

It must be observed, the numbers we hare stated which ought to have been returned to the lords of the Admiralty, are not the numbers of seamen actually employed in each year in the merchants service, but the numbers which, if constantly employed, would have paid the amount of the duty collected. Supposing seamen in general to be employed only during two-thirds of the year, the numbers necessary to pay the duty must be increased one-third; but this estimate, we apprehend, would fall very short of the number of men actually employed in the trade of Great Britain.&#x2014;In order to bring the collection of the duty to some test, we procured from Mr. John Dalley, assistant Register General of shipping in the port of London, the following Accounts, which are annually laid before parliament, of the Number of Men employed in the Merchants Service:</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01722">"An account of the number of ships, with their tonnage, and number of men and boys usually employed in navigating the same, that have been registered at and belong to the several ports of Great Britain, and appear, by the books of the register general of shipping, to have been in existence on the 30th of Sept. in the years 1799, 1800, and 1801, distinguishing each year;" with an abstract of the same, including the number of ships and vessels belonging to the several ports in the British dominions: also, "an account of the number of men and boys, which appear by the reports of the masters to have been employed in the merchants service in Great Britain on board British ships entered inwards and outwards from and to foreign parts, during the last 10 years; distinguishing England from Scotland."</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01723">We likewise examined Mr. Dalley, for the purpose of ascertaining whether any account was kept by his, or any other department, of the number of seamen actually employed in the merchants service; but although Mr. Dalley took considerable pains in making a calculation of the number so employed in vessels belonging to England and Scotland in the year 1801, yet the basis on which it was formed is much too uncertain to induce us to offer an opinion on the propriety of the collection of the Sixpenny duty in that year; and he himself is of opinion with us, that there is no mode of ascertaining the number of seamen actually employed, by which the receipt of Greenwich Hospital duty can be checqued; but it must be observed, that
<image src="S1V0003P0I0492"/>
<col>955</col>
in the account presented to us by Mr. Dalley the registered tonnage of the port of Beaumaris would require 1,162 men to navigate it; which, if constantly employed, would produce a revenue to Greenwich Hospital of 348l. 12s.; whereas it appears, the gross sum collected in that port, which embraces the minor ports of Barmouth, Conway, Carnarvon, Pulhelly, and Holyhead, in the year 1802, amounted only to 67l. 7s. 2d. We therefore recommend, that the commissioners of the Sixpenny Duty frequently have recourse to this account, to see whether the sums collected in the several ports bear a proportion to the tonnage and number of men said to be employed in them.&#x2014;The statute of the 2d of George II. after stating that the act of the 10th of Queen Anne, directing the Sixpenny Duty to be paid within 14 days from the ships being cleared inwards by the officers of the Customs, hath been found ineffectual, inasmuch as many masters and commanders, after they have been cleared inwards at the Custom-House, have wholly neglected to pay the said duty, directs, that the same shall in future be paid before any ship or vessel shall be cleared inwards; and that no officer of the Customs shall grant any cocquets, transires, returns, or discharges, or permit any ship or vessel to go out of port until the master shall have produced to him a certificate of the payment of the Greenwich Hospital duty.&#x2014;This regulation, intended to enforce a due and regular payment of the Sixpenny-Duty, has not been so effectual as was probably intended, owing to the meaning of the words "cleared inwards" not having been absolutely defined; for although it would appear to be intended, that the duty should be paid before the ship or vessel be cleared of her cargo, and before the Custom-House officers placed on board be taken away, as is actually expressed in the act of the 20th of George II. constituting a fund, by a similar duty, for the support of maimed and disabled seamen in the merchants service, yet the words "cleared inwards" have been construed and acted upon in the port of London as regarding only a certificate, to be granted by the tide surveyors, of the ship being cleared; which certificate is only required for the purpose of rendering the ship eligible to the making an entry outwards; and as a fee is payable on it, the certificate is probably seldom applied for until it is absolutely required, frequently not until after a considerable
<col>956</col>
lapse of time; and if the vessel should be broken up, as in that case such certificate cannot be necessary, it would appear, the duty to Greenwich Hospital would never become payable.&#x2014;Although, in some cases, it has come to the knowledge of the commissioners for the collection of the Sixpenny Duty, that the tide surveyors have even given false clearing notes, certifying that the Greenwich Hospital duty has been paid, when it has not been so, they have, notwithstanding the controul over the officers of the Customs given to them by the act, contented themselves with the bare promise of their never doing so again, instead of suing them for the penalties incurred by their misconduct; and since the collection of this Duty has been managed by the clerks of the Sixpenny Office, it appears they have frequently sent for the tide surveyors; but they have not been able effectually to checque a practice so injurious to the revenue of Greenwich Hospital.&#x2014;We find, that owing to the absence of the commissioners, it has been a practice for the chief clerk to the receiver to sign receipts for the Sixpenny Duty, as deputy to the receiver, and also as deputy to the comptroller, except in cases where blank receipts have been signed by them, and left at the office to be used at his discretion: the chief clerk has also, in some instances, felt himself compelled to sign deputations for the appointment of receivers at the out-ports, lest the revenue of Greenwich Hospital should be injured. We cannot refrain from expressing our disapprobation of such a mode of conducting the business of a public office; and recommend, that measures be adopted to prevent a recurrence of the same.&#x2014;To obviate the difficulty as to the time of payment of this duty to the receiver of the Sixpenny Office, or his deputies, we recommend that the duty be made payable before the ship or vessel be cleared of her cargo, and before the Custom-House officers placed on board be taken off, as provided for by the 20th of George II. with respect to the payment of sixpence per man a month to the Merchants Seamens Fund; and that the master neglecting to pay the duty before the ship be so cleared, shall forfeit to Greenwich Hospital the sum of 20l.; and we think the commissioners should either be authorized to levy the penalties imposed by the several acts relative to the Sixpenny Duty, with power to mitigate them, or that they should be enabled to recover the penalties in a summary
<image src="S1V0003P0I0493"/>
<col>957</col>
way before a magistrate.&#x2014;We further recommend, that the attention of the commissioners of the Sixpenny Office be directed to the due payment of the duty within the times prescribed by the act, and that the commissioners be required, in every case of failure or wilful neglect, to sue for or levy the penalties imposed.&#x2014;That in future every ship-master or owner, or other person tendering payment of the Sixpenny Duty, be required to produce a list of the crew, with the times of their respective entries and discharges, to which they should invariably be required to make affidavit, agreeably to the act.&#x2014;The times of the deputy receivers making their remittances to the Sixpenny Office are quarterly, half-yearly, or yearly, and are said to be so according to the amount of their receipts; but we observe that the receipts of many of the deputies who are permitted to remit yearly are greater than the annual collection of those who do so quarterly, and we understand that no revision of this subject has taken place since the year 1767. We therefore recommend that this very proper regulation be more attended to, and that the times of the deputies making their remittances be revised and altered as occasion may require; and we also recommend that the accounts of the several deputies be made up to certain stated periods, and not, as at present, from the date or their respective appointments.&#x2014;The deputy receivers for Ireland are very generally in arrear, some more than 10 or 12 years; we therefore recommend that steps be taken to recover the monies due to Greenwich Hospital, and that the commissioners be more attentive in future to the collection and remittance of the duty from Ireland.&#x2014;We understand that vessels going coastwise do not pay the Sixpenny Duty in the port of London, except when sold or broken up. The plea urged for this practice is, that the advantage derived by many of the deputy receivers at the out-ports from the commission on the receipt of the Sixpenny Duty is so small, as not to render the appointment an object of consideration, and that in some instances, difficulty has been experienced in obtaining persons to accept the situations; but we see no reason why the revenue arising from the Coasting Trade should not be collected by the Sixpenny Office, and not be made subject to a deduction of 12&#x00BD; per cent. for collection, merely to add to the emoluments of the deputy receivers at the out-ports; the officers of
<col>958</col>
the Customs being required by the statutes the 10th of Queen Anne and 2d of George II. to collect and receive the Six-penny Duty, if deputed by the receiver or receivers for that purpose.&#x2014;Numerous forfeitures, and penalties imposed by various acts of parliament, have been given, either wholly or in part, towards the support of Greenwich Hospital; but although the provisions of the acts have been frequently violated, there are but few instances of persons having been prosecuted for the penalties, and none at the suit of the commissioners of the Sixpenny duty; although the tide surveyors, who, granted certificates of the duly having been paid, when it was not, appear to us to have been very fit objects for prosecution.&#x2014;We shall now proceed to speak of the moiety of the wages of men deserting from ships in the African trade, forfeited to Greenwich Hospital by an act, passed in the 30th year of his present Majesty's reign, intituled, "An Act to amend and continue, for a limited time, several Acts of Parliament for regulating the Shipping and carrying Slaves in British Vessels from the coast of Africa, and which has been continued by several subsequent acts.&#x2014;It does not appear that the commissioners of the Sixpenny Duty ever received any specific directions to collect the moiety of the wages of Run Men so forfeited; but as they had been in the practice of collecting all the forfeitures and penalties payable to Greenwich Hospital, and as their communication with the masters arid owners of the merchant shipping of Great Britain afforded much facility to the receipt of it, they took upon themselves the charge of the collection, and it has, since the passing of the act, afforded a considerable addition to the revenue of Greenwich Hospital.&#x2014;The appointments of the Deputy Receivers at the out-ports authorize and require them to receive all monies payable to Greenwich Hospital, and they have, under that authority, received the moiety of Run Mens wages in the African trade, on which the same rate of commission, 12&#x00BD; per cent. has been allowed, as for the receipt of the Sixpenny Duty.&#x2014;The money so collected at the port of London has been paid into Greenwich Hospital by the receiver, under the general head of "Forfeitures," and at the out-ports it has been added to the produce of the Sixpenny Duty, and paid in under that head; and as the receiver does not give to Greenwich Hospital any specification of the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0494"/>
<col>959</col>
manner in which the forfeitures in the port of London have arisen, the directors cannot, by the accounts furnished, have any knowledge that the revenue of the Hospital has been encreased by the moiety of the Run Mens wages. We are not disposed to attribute this misstatement of the accounts of the Sixpenny Office to an improper motive; but we recommend, that in future the receiver of the Sixpenny Duty do state distinctly, in his annual account, the different heads under which the monies have arisen.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01724">We shall, lastly, proceed to speak of the Receipt of the Wages of Men dying on board of Ships in the West India trade, directed to be paid to the receiver of the Sixpenny Duty by an act of the 37th of his present Majesty, intituled, "An Act for preventing the Desertion of Seamen from British Merchant Ships trading to his Majesty's colonies and plantations in the West Indies," and by which a duty has been imposed on the Sixpenny Office totally foreign to its original institution; namely, that of the receipt of the wages of all seamen dying on the voyage from any port of Great Britain to and from any of the colonies or plantations in the West Indies, for the use of their executors or administrators; but if not claimed by them within 3 years, are forfeited, and directed to be paid to the use of the merchant seamens Hospitals, or, where none, to the magistrates of the county, to be by them distributed among the old and disabled seamen of the port to which the ship may belong.&#x2014;The act imposing this duty on the Sixpenny Office having made no provision for defraying the expences of the collection, a correspondence took place between the commissioners of the Sixpenny Office and the Lords of the Admiraly on the subject, by whom they were authorized to make the same allowance to the Deputy Receivers at the out-ports for the collection of this money, as for the Sixpenny Duty, to be defrayed out of the Greenwich Hospital revenue.&#x2014;The commissioners of the Sixpenny Office, very soon after the passing of the act in 1797, reduced the rate of commission to 5 per cent. at the ports of Liverpool and Bristol, owing to the great amount of their receipts; but at the other ports it continues at 12&#x00BD; per cent. except at the port of London, where no commission is charged.&#x2014;The commission on the
<col>960</col>
receipt of the wages of deceased seamen is deducted by the deputy receivers out of the monies payable to Greenwich Hospital.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01725">At the expiration of 3 years, when the unclaimed wages become forfeited, the receiver of the Sixpenny Duty has, previous to making distribution to the Merchant Seamens Hospitals, deducted the sum advanced out of the Greenwich Hospital revenue for defraying the expence of the collection of the year for which the distribution is to be made; and although he has had no authority whatever for so doing, yet we cannot disapprove of the measure, as there was no other mode of repaying the monies advanced; and, as we conceive, it never could have been the intention of the legislature, that Greenwich Hospital should have been at the expence of collecting the revenue of the Merchant Seamens Hospitals.&#x2014;The sums which have been deducted from the Sixpenny Duty, on account of the commission on Dead Mens wages to the 31st Doc. 1802, have amounted to 1,988l. 0s. 9d. of which 551l. 0s. 9d. has been repaid in the manner before stated, leaving a balance of 1,437l. due to Greenwich Hospital, being the amount of 3 years commission, which the Hospital must always be in advance, according to the system that has been adopted.&#x2014;There can be no sufficient reason why Greenwich Hospital should advance money, or be at any ex-pence in collecting the wages of men dying in the West India trade, as it derives no advantage from it whatever; we therefore recommend that the receiver of the Sixpenny Duty be authorized and directed to deduct the sums that have been advanced from the first monies that become payable to the merchant seamens Hospitals; and, after Greenwich Hospital shall be repaid, that the commission, and other necessary expences, on the receipt of Dead Mens wages in the preceding year, be deducted out of the monies payable in the beginning of the year ensuing to the merchant seamens Hospitals.&#x2014;We also recommend that the receiver of the Sixpenny Duty be authorized to deduct a commission of 2&#x00BD; per cent. upon the receipt of Dead Mens wages in the port of London, which will amount to about 100l. a year, such commission to be paid to Greenwich Hospital, to indemnify it for the expence of a clerk, the greatest part of whose time must necessarily be occupied in transacting this business.&#x2014;No notice whatever has been taken in the accounts furnished by the receiver of the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0495"/>
<col>961</col>
Sixpenny Duty to Greenwich Hospital, of the sums which have been deducted from its revenue on account of the commission on Dead Mens wages, nor of the mode or time of its repayment; it has, as before stated, been deducted from the amount of the Sixpenny Duty, and, when repaid at the end of 3 years, it has been carried to the account of Greenwich Hospital under the head of "Sixpenny Duty received in "the port of London:" although we believe that no improper motive has led to the keeping this transaction from the knowledge of the directors of the Hospital, yet we hold it to be our duty to express our disapprobation of this mode of stating the accounts of the Sixpenny Office.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01726">The sum of 109l. 17s. 10d. has been collected, and remains in the hands of the representative of the late receiver of the Sixpenny Duty, on account of the wages of men dying on board ships in the West India trade, belonging to ports in America and the West Indies: as the act directs that the wages which shall be unclaimed at the end of 3 years shall be paid to the merchant seamens Hospitals of the port where the ship belongs, or, where none, to the magistrates of the county, to be distributed amongst the old and disabled seamen of the port, it does not appear to us to have been the intention of the legislature, that such money should have been collected; but, if it should remain unclaimed, we think it ought to be appropriated to repay Greenwich Hospital the monies that have been advanced on account of the commission on Dead Mens wages.&#x2014;The act directs, that the accounts of the wages of men dying during the voyage shall be delivered by the masters, upon oath, within 10 days from the ship's arrival, to the collector or comptroller of the Customs, and that the amount shall be paid within 3 months to the receiver of the Sixpenny Duty, who has no authority to require a second affidavit from the master.&#x2014;We are therefore of opinion, that the collector or comptroller's clerk in the port of London should transmit, twice a week, to the Sixpenny Office, a report of ships entered inwards from the West Indies, containing an account of the sums sworn to by the several masters, as the amount of the wages of men who have died during the voyage, for which the Sixpenny Office should make the clerk an adequate compensation.&#x2014;And as the time for paying over the amount of Dead Mens wages to the receiver of the Sixpenny Duty appears to
<col>962</col>
us unnecessarily long, inasmuch as the ship may be in the West Indies again before the time limited for the payment of the money has expired, we recommend its being shortened to one month from the time of delivering the account upon oath to the collector or comptroller of the Customs.&#x2014;With a view to the recommending the placing the receipt of the wages of men dying in the West India trade under the direction of the trustees and directors of the Merchant Seamens Hospitals at the several ports, who collect their own revenue, arising from a Duty of Sixpence per month from seamen in the merchants service, and a moiety of the Run Mens Wages in the African trade, for the support of their establishments, which alone are benefited by the unclaimed wages of men dying in the West India trade, we examined Mr. W. Oddy, secretary to the Merchant Seamens Corporation; but, from the information we obtained, we are inclined to think the monies would not be so well collected, and that the Merchant Seamens Hospitals are more benefited at present than they would be if the business was placed under their own direction.&#x2014;As the wages are paid to the representatives without any deduction, and as the whole of the commission on the receipt is taken from such wages as remain unclaimed at t he end of 3 years, whereby the sums payable to the Merchant Seamens Hospitals are considerably reduced, it occurred to us it might be advisable to recommend, that the commission allowed on the collection might be deducted from the monies received by the representatives; but as we find the wages are frequently paid to them on the same day they are received by the Sixpenny Office, and as they are generally wives or relations in indigent circumstances, we are disposed to think the expence of the collection had better be defrayed, as it has hitherto been, from the wages that remain unclaimed.&#x2014;The money in the hands of Mr. John Rashleigh, the late Receiver of the Sixpenny Duty, on the 17th May 1803, the time of his decease, amounted to the sum of 13,712l. 16s. 11&#x00BD;d. viz.</p>

The former sum was paid by the executor of Mr. Rashleigh to the Treasurer of Greenwich Hospital on the 28th of May and the 28th of July last, and the latter remains in the hands of his executor, subject to the claims of the representatives of such deceased seamen, for 3 years, and at the end of that term, the sums remaining unclaimed must be paid to the Merchant Seamens Hospitals by him, according to the provisions of the act, unless he should be induced to pay over to Mr. Rashleigh's successor the amount of Dead Mens wages in his hands, on receiving a bond of indemnity, as it appears die present receiver of the Sixpenny Duty cannot, as the law now stands, give a legal discharge for such money; but we are of opinion it is highly expedient, that, upon the demise or removal of a receiver, the sum of money in his hands at the time should be paid over to his successor in office, it being evidently the intention of the legislature that the wages should be paid to the receiver in his official and not in his private capacity, as otherwise the object of security might be defeated, and the representatives would have to seek for an individual, instead of applying at a public office for the monies due to them.&#x2014;The monies paid into Greenwich Hospital in the year 1802 by the Receiver of the Sixpenny Duty, amounted to 22,758l. 5s. 1d. but the receipt of that year was swelled beyond its usual amount by the paying off the armed vessels in government service, and by the return of the transports from abroad, which were several years in arrear to the Sixpenny Office. On an average of the last 20 years there has been paid in the sum of 13,736l. 0s. 5d. and the average of the salaries and incidental expences of the establishment during that time has been 1,402l. 2s. 10d.&#x2014;The Receiver makes his payments to Greenwich Hospital of the money received by him within the year, by eight instalments, viz.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01728">On the 28th of April, the Receipt of the Port of London for the months of January and February.</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01736">And on the 28th of March in each year, the Receiver delivers an Annual Account of his Receipts and Disbursements, with Vouchers for the latter, to the Directors of Greenwich Hospital; but the only checque upon his receipts is a certificate given on the account, by the accountant and comptroller, that he has duly charged himself with all sums received on account of the Hospital.&#x2014;In this Account the gross produce of the Hospital revenue is not stated, with the several charges of collection; but simply a net sum, as the amount of the Sixpenny Duty, is placed against the names of the several Ports in England, with the amounts of the collection in Scotland and Ireland, without any notice of Run Mens wages, or the commission on Dead Mens wages; and, in order to magnify the Receipts in the Port of London, it has been the practice since the year 1766, to deduct the amount of the salaries and incidental charges of the Sixpenny Office from the monies collected at the out-ports, without stating in the Account that it was so deducted.&#x2014;By the mode of payment to Greenwich Hospital before stated, there is always left in the hands of the receiver and his deputies the amount of two months collection; but the balance of the receiver, at the time of making four of his payments, is suffered to accumulate to the amount of 4 months collection, and in the others to 3. As we see noreason why the Receiver should make his payments under specific heads, we recommend that he do in future pay over to the Treasurer of Greenwich Hospital, on the first day of every month, the amount of money in his hands on account; and that he do make up his Annual Accounts, as at present, to the 31st of Dec. and pay over the remaining balance, if any, on the 28th of March in each year.&#x2014;From what is before stated, it will have been observed, that the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0497"/>
<col>965</col>
Accounts rendered to Greenwich Hospital by the commissioners of the Sixpenny Duty are fallacious, inasmuch as no notice whatever is taken of the moiety of Run Mens wages in the African trade, or of other Forfeitures and Penalties at the out-ports, nor of the sums that have been advanced or repaid on Account of the Commission on Dead Mens wages in the West India trade; and by not noticing the periods to which the deputies have made their payments, the Directors of the Hospital must be led to suppose they are not very much in arrear; we therefore recommend, that the Receiver of the Sixpenny Duty, in his Annual Account to Greenwich Hospital, do state each particular head of receipt, with the gross amount of the sums collected, and the expences thereon, and that he detail the Receipts of the Ports of Scotland and Ireland the same as those of England, noting the time against each Port to which the Duties have been paid up, by which means the directors and auditor of Greenwich Hospital will be enabled to notice any improper charges or allowances, to compare the Receipts of one year with another, under each particular head, and to direct their attention to any branch of the Revenue of the Hospital</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01738">By the salaries we have proposed, an increase of expence to Greenwich Hospital will appear to be incurred of 470l. a year; but we apprehend, that the additional revenue which the Hospital will derive from a vigilant superintendence of its receipt, if proper persons be appointed, will more than compensate for this expence; and besides, the reduction of the commission of the Deputy Receiver at Liverpool, say to five per cent, on the Receipt of the Sixpenny Duty, and on Run Mens wages, will produce a saving of at least 300l. a year; the Hospital will likewise be a gainer of 100l. a year by the commission of 2&#x00BD; per cent. proposed to be charged on the Receipt of Dead Mens wages at the Port of London; and, by pay-

which they may think badly collected.&#x2014;On considering the Establishment of the Office, and the duties to be performed, we are of opinion, that two commissioners are fully adequate to conduct the business; one to be Receiver, as at present, and the other a checque upon the Receiver, under the denomination of Comptroller.&#x2014;As the proper collection of the Hospital Revenue, and the due accounting for the same, must depend on the ability and assiduity of these officers, the necessity for efficient persons being selected to fill the situations must be apparent; and we recommend that constant personal attendance be required of them, as we conceive, that with proper attention on their part to the Collection of the Duty in the Port of London, and to the conduct of the Deputy Receivers, the Revenue of Greenwich Hospital may be considerably increased.&#x2014;The Salaries which we think may be proper to be allowed to the officers and clerks, are as follows; and we are of opinion, that each clerk should take an affidavit, that he will not directly or indirectly receive any fee, gratuity, perquisite, or emolument, in any shape whatever, for the execution of his duty, other than the salary allowed him.</p>

<title>PLYMOUTH YARD.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01744">THE Naval Arsenal at Plymouth Dock was first established in the year 1691; and it appears by the Records, that, previous to that time, the master shipwrights and the artificers were borne on board one of his Majesty's Ships fitted for their accommodation.&#x2014;The affairs of the Dock Yard are conducted under the general superintendence of a Commissioner, chosen from the captains in his Majesty's Navy: he has authority over all persons employed in the Yard, but he has no power to reward, promote, or even to cause a man to be entered into the service; and from this circumstance, the Commissioner, although the principal, appears to have less influence over the
<col>968</col>
workmen than any other officer; this seems to be a defect in the system, as we conceive all principals should have it more or less in their power to distinguish and reward the ability, zeal, and industry of those employed under them; and without such power, we apprehend authority will seldom be respected. The principal duty of the Commissioner is to enforce obedience to the Orders and Regulations of the Navy Board, which are sent to him to be delivered to the respective officers; no Orders originate with him, except in cases of emergency, such as the issuing stores to, or repairing any ships which the Commander in Chief of the Port may represent as wanted for immediate and special service; and as all the Returns and Accounts are sent by the respective officers to the Navy Board, the duty of the Commissioner, which is not well defined, appears to relate more particularly to the executive business of the Yard.&#x2014;Over each Department an Officer presides, who is individually responsible for the due execution of the business entrusted to his management. In his Majesty's Yard at Plymouth, the principal Officers consist of&#x2014;
<ul>
<li>A MASTER SHIPWRIGHT,</li>
<li>TWO MASTERS ATTENDANT,</li>
<li>A CLERK of the CHECQUE,</li>
<li>A STOREKEEPER,</li>
<li>A CLERK of the SURVEY,</li>
<li>A CLERK of the ROPE YARD.</li></ul></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01745">The duties of the Master Shipwright are multifarious and important; he has the direction and superintendence of nearly the whole operative business of the Dock Yard; in the execution of which he is assisted by four subordinate professional officers, termed "Assistants to the Master Shipwright;" one of whom is particularly entrusted with the management and conversion of timber, and is stiled "Timber Master;" of which office we shall have occasion to speak more at large in a subsequent Report.&#x2014;It is likewise the peculiar duty of the Master Shipwright to inspect the quality of all stores received from contractors, which are used in his department, and to attest their fitness for the service; to survey and value all vessels hired or purchased into his Majesty's Navy; to keep an Account, and certify to the Navy Board, the Quantity of all Works performed by contract in the Dock Yard; and to keep an Account of the Earnings of the respective artificers under his superintendence, and to certify the Amount from time to time to the Clerk of the Checque.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01746">The duty of the Masters Attendant is to?
<image src="S1V0003P0I0499"/>
<col>969</col>
superintend the Works carrying on in the Sail Loft and Rigging House; to muster and direct the employment of the persons borne in the Ordinary; to attend the launching, docking, masting, and ballasting his Majesty's ships; to attend to the ships coming into and going out of port, and their removal from one part of the harbour to another, and to take care that proper moorings be provided for them; to see to the timely provision of the Rigging and Sails of the ships preparing for sea, to inspect the quality of all stores used in their department, either purchased or served in upon contract, and to certify to the Navy Board their fitness for the service.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01747">The duty of the Clerk of the Checque is to muster the several persons belonging to the Yard, upon their coming to or quitting work; to keep an Account of their Wages; to make out, quarterly, the Pay Books of the Yard and Ordinary; to muster the companies of his Majesty's ships in Commission, and the persons employed on board the ships in Ordinary, and to check the absentees of their provisions; to muster at certain periods the Marines at head quarters; to view, in conjunction with the other officers, the quality of all stores received, and to make out certificates of the quantities, when required by the contractors, in order to their obtaining payment of the Navy Board; to attend in film with the Storekeeper and Clerk of the Survey, the receipt of all Stores, and the delivery of lots of old stores to the purchasers; he likewise pays bounty to volunteer seamen, and the contingencies of the Yard: Several other payments have been imposed on this officer, by recent acts of parliament, relating to Seamen's wages, which are totally unconnected with his situation in the Dock Yard, and will become the subject of our future observation.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01748">The Storekeeper has charge of, and is accountable for all stores received into the Dock Yard; it is likewise his duty, in rotation with the Clerk of the Checque and Clerk of the Survey, to attend the survey and receipt of all stores from contractors, and the delivery of lots of old stores to the purchasers; and to check the certificates made out by the Clerk of the Checque, for stores received upon contract.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01749">The duty of the Clerk of the Survey is, in conjunction with the master shipwright and master attendant, to direct the issues of all stores to the Warrant Officers of Ships, and for the Use of the Yard, and to keep a charge against the persons to whom they are
<col>970</col>
issued; to survey all articles returned into store, and with the Clerk of the Checque and Storekeeper, to attend the surrey and receipt of all stores from contractors, and the delivery of lots of old stores to the purchasers; and to examine the certificates made out by the Clerk of the Checque of the stores received, by which die contractors obtain payment.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01750">The duty of the Clerk of the Rope Yard combines the offices of the Clerk of the Checque and Storekeeper; he musters the people in that department, upon their coming to and quitting work; and is cliarged with the hemp, tar, and other articles, used in ropemaking, of the expenditure of which he keeps an account.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01751">From a consideration of the various and important duties entrusted to the officers in his Majesty's Yards, it would be expected that upon their appointment they should be famished with full and sufficient Instructions for the regulation of their conduct; but upon enquiry of the officers of his Majesty's Yard at Plymouth, we find that the Instructions under which they act are of very ancient date (prior to the year 1700); that they have not been revived since their establishment, and have in great part been abrogated by orders issued by the Navy Board from time to time, adapted to the various circumstances of the service as they have arisen. These occasional Orders or Instructions have accumulated to a great extent, superseding each other as the opinions or those entrusted with the direction of the civil department of the Navy have varied; and as no abstract of them, under the particular heads of service to which they relate, has been kept at Plymouth Yard, it is only by a reference to the documents themselves, voluminous and often contradictory, that an officer upon his appointment can (and that with much industry and application) gain a knowledge of the duties of his station.&#x2014;It will appear by the evidence of the Clerk of the Checque, that the Instructions, however insufficient for the regulation of hit conduct, have not even been given to him, either at the time of, or subsequent to his appointment; nor were they delivered to him with the other official documents by his predecessor, on his entering upon office.&#x2014;We understand that the Navy Board, in the year 1785, had it in contemplation to make a general Collection and Digest of their Standing Orders or Regulations; and that an Abstract of the dates of them up to the 31st of Dec. 1784, arranged under different
<image src="S1V0003P0I0500"/>
<col>971</col>
heads, was actually formed and forwarded to the officers of Plymouth Yard, who were acquainted that a general Collection was preparing; that it should be sent to them when completed; and that in future, they should be furnished with the substance and dates of all Standing Regulations, in order to their being added to such collection. It is much to be regretted that this very useful work was not accomplished, as it would have greatly facilitated the business of the Dock Yard,' and afforded to the Navy Board a comprehensive view of their Standing Regulations, whereby they would have been enabled to have kept a better check upon the due observance of them, than in the course of this Report will appear to have existed.&#x2014;The advantage of officers placed in situations of important public trust, being furnished with Instructions for the general outline of their duty, is too obvious to need comment; and we cannot too strongly recommend a revision of the Instructions to the officers of his Majesty's Yards, adapting them to the present extended scale of the naval service.&#x2014;The inferior officers of die Deck Yards have no Instructions whatever for their guidance, but act immediately under the direction of their superior officers. It may be advanced, that the officer who is held generally responsible, should have the entire direction of his subordinates: in the executive branch of his business, we fully accord in this opinion; but as various accounts relating to the different classes of artificers, placed under the superintendence of these inferior officers or master workmen, are kept and rendered by them, for which they alone can in fact be held responsible, we are of opinion, that they also should have Instructions for their guidance, as their present means of gaining information of the regulations of the Board on these subjects are very precarious and imperfect.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01752">In May, 1801, some Regulations were established, by Order of his Majesty in Council, for the better government of the Dock Yards; grounded on the Report made in 1783, by the commissioners appointed by an act of parliament, passed in the 25th of his present Majesty's reign, to enquire into the Fees and Emoluments of the Public Offices.&#x2014;The principal objects of these Regulations were, the Establishment of a System for the better Management and Conversion of Timber; the Abolition of the Fees, Perquisites, and Emoluments, formerly received by the Officers and Clerks; and of the long-established privilege enjoyed
<col>972</col>
by the workmen of carrying Chips out of the Yard, which had grown into a serious abuse.&#x2014;In lieu of the multifarious Emoluments of the officers and clerks, arising from Fees and Perquisites, permanent annual salaries were allotted to them, proportioned to the responsibility and labour at their situations; and an allowance in money was given to the workmen for the loss of the Chips, according to the following Table, which is paid to them weekly by the Clerk of the Checque, through the medium of the auartermen and foremen in the different branches.</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01758">The principal Classes of Artificers employed in the Yard are, Shipwrights, Caulkers, Joiners, House Carpenters, Smiths, Bricklayers and Masons, Sail-makers, Riggers, and Ropemakers.&#x2014;The whole of the workmen, except the 3 latter classes, are employed under the direction and superintendence of the Master Shipwright; the sailmakers and riggers are under the Masters Attendant; and the rope-makers are considered as a separate establishment, under the direction of officers specifically appointed for the purpose.&#x2014;The vacancies for artificers and labourers are filled up by the nomination of the officers having the direction of them, subject to the approbation of the commissioner; they are examined by the surgeon of the Yard previous to their entry, to ascertain that they have no bodily infirmities; and each artificer is tried as to his professional skill and ability, by the foreman of the shipwrights or master workmen.&#x2014;The common hours of labour in this Yard have been regulated according to the different seasons of the year: viz. from the 2d of Dec. to the 1st of Feb. they are from 7 in the morning till dusk in the evening: from the 2d of Feb. to the 1st of March, from &#x00BD; past 6 in the morning to six in the evening, if the day-light will permit: from the 2d of March to the 1st of Oct. from 6 in the morning to 6 in the evening: from the 2d of Oct. to the 1st of Dec. from &#x00BC; past 6 in the morning to 6 in the evening, or as long as the day-light will permit.&#x2014;The workmen have likewise a stipulated time for dinner, which varies also according to the seasons of the year; being two hours in summer, one hour and a half in spring and autumn, and one hour in winter.&#x2014;The Artificers and Labourers are mustered by the Clerk of the Checque, or some of his clerks, in general by the first and third; the workmen being divided, and borne upon separate books, in order that they may be called at the same time in different parts of the Yard, to save time in mustering.&#x2014;When the workmen are allowed to leave the Yard to dine, they
<col>974</col>
are mustered three times a day; on their coming to work in the morning, on their returning from dinner, and again when they quit work in the evening; but when they are employed extra, and remain at work during their dinner time, they are mustered only in the morning and afternoon.&#x2014;It has been stated to us, that the Workmen are allowed in winter from 10 to 15, and in summer from 5 to 10 minutes for assembling, beyond the time prescribed for their coming into the Yard; and that the mustering takes up from 25 to 30 minutes: allowing the time so lost to be upon an average only half an hour, and the number of mea belonging to the Dock Yard to be 2190, as it stood on the 6lh of Sept. 1803, there would be a loss of time in the course of the year by the morning and noon musters, equal to the employment of 34,273 men for a day; and the value of the labour so lost, estimating the pay of the workmen on an average at 3s. per day, is 5140l. 19s.&#x2014;We are therefore of opinion, that the public would derive considerable advantage were the workmen mustered in five or six divisions by different clerks, at the same time, insead of two.&#x2014;When the workmen during the late war were paid for working the whole of their dinner time, they were allowed half an hour to eat their dinners, which were brought into the Yard; this apparent overpayment is stated by the officers to have been counterbalanced by the time saved, which would otherwise have been lost in mustering, had they quitted the Yard: so that the above calculation equally holds good, whether the men were, or were not mustered in the middle of the day. In the evening the muster does not take place until after the bell has rung for the men to leave work, and consequently the time taken up in mustering is not lost to the public.&#x2014;At the times of mustering, if any of the men do not answer on being called, they are checked, or noted Absent on the Book, by dots placed against their names, thus Morning/.Evening; and the mark denoting; them present, or entitled to their pay for the day, is drawn through the Line thus | Morning/| Evening. By this mode of setting off the musters, the means of abuse are easy, as the check can be removed almost beyond the power of detection, merely by drawing a line over the dots.&#x2014;In the course of our enquiry, it appeared that this abuse had existed previous to the Regulations before alluded to, established in May, 1801, when the clerks whose
<image src="S1V0003P0I0502"/>
<col>975</col>
particular duty it was to muster the workmen, were in the practice of receiving Fees quarterly from the men, for notes, certifying the amount of their wages, upon the credit of which many of them were in the practice of borrowing money; these Fees varied in amount from 1 to 5s. on each note, according to the class and wages of the party.&#x2014;Although these Fees were represented to have been given for the quarterly notes, yet we are inclined to believe that they have operated with the clerks in the removal of the Checks; for since that inducement was removed, the practice, as it has been stated to us, has been discontinued.&#x2014;We are however of opinion, that the recurrence of this abuse would be prevented, if the clerks were to deliver to the commissioner, immediately after mustering, a list of the men who had not answered to their names, by which Lists the Muster Books should be examined previous to the Pay Books being made out from them.&#x2014;The established Rates of Daily Pay of most of the classes of workmen have been fixed upwards of a century, and have not undergone any variation; but their actual wages have considerably exceeded those rates of pay, from two circumstances; first, from their having worked in extra time, or beyond the usual hours of labour; and secondly, from the Navy Board's having adopted a plan for employing them by the piece, which has been denominated Task and Job Work. The general distinction in the use of those terms, has been to call Building, or new Work, Task; and Repairs, Job. The workmen, both before and since the introduction of Piece Work, have been employed as much extra time as the exigencies of the service required; the necessity for which, except in cases of a pressing nature, decided by the commissioner on the spot, has been judged of by the Navy Board, who have issued their warrants from time to time, fixing the Rates of Extra at which the workmen were to be employed.&#x2014;The extra employment has been divided into certain portions of time called Nights and Tides; a Night consists of five hours additional labour, for which the workmen are allowed a day's pay, and a Tide of one hour and a half, for which they are allowed rather less than the third of a day's pay.&#x2014;When the workmen have been employed by the Piece, a maximum has at different times been fixed by the Navy Board upon the amount of their earnings, which has been governed By the Rates of Daily Pay, and the allowances for Extra; for instance, when the
<col>976</col>
workmen have been directed to be employed by Task or Job at the rate of single day, and one or two Tides in the common working hours, it has meant that though employed by the Piece, their earnings were to be restricted to the sum of the established daily rate of pay, and the allowance for one or two Tides extra. The Rate of two for one, or double days, in the single day hours, has meant, that their earnings were to be restricted to double the amount of the established daily pay; and three for one, in like manner, has meant, that their wages were not to exceed thrice the amount of the established daily pay.&#x2014;The term Extra formerly related only to the additional time that the workmen were employed, and the wages paid for that time. Since the introduction of Task and Job work, it has been taken in a more extensive sense, and is used to express not only time beyond the usual hours of labour, but any mode of working, though within those hours, by which the wages of the men are increased beyond the established rate of daily pay. For instance; the employment by Job or Piece, by which the men may earn two for one, or double pay, is called working extra, although the work is performed in the usual hours. In fact, every thing is considered as extra beyond the established daily pay.&#x2014;Whenever it is judged expedient to employ the workmen on Sundays, they are allowed ah extra day's pay, in addition to the sum earned; and when they are employed on board ships in Plymouth Sound or Cawsand Bay, they are (to prevent loss of time in going backwards and forwards), required to sleep on board, for which they are allowed an extra day's pay, and are victualled in the same manner as the seamen; so that when they are employed on Sundays and sleep afloat, they have two days pay, and an allowance of provisions, in addition to their actual earnings. We cannot but consider these allowances as profuse, and whenever an adequate rate of pay is established for the different classes of workmen, we apprehend half a day's pay, in addition to the established rate, will be deemed an adequate compensation for their employment on Sundays, and that a shilling a day, with provisions, must be thought sufficient for the Shipwrights and Caulkers for sleeping afloat.&#x2014;The Artificers and Labourers, when hurt in His Majesty's Service, are attended by the surgeon of the Yard, and are allowed the established daily pay of the class to which they belong, for six weeks, if unable to resume their labour at a shorter

<col>977</col>
period. There is likewise an Establishment of Superannuation for the different Classes, to which they are admitted if rendered incapable of labour from hurts received, or after an uninterrupted service of thirty years.&#x2014;The Shipwrights, Caulkers, Joiners, House Carpenters, Bricklayers, Masons, Sailmakers, Smiths, Quarter Boys, and Oakum Boys, have an Allowance of two-pence halfpenny a week, under the title of Lodging Money; the intention and origin of this allowance we have been unable to trace, but in an Order dated 5th April 1699, it is stated to have been a practice at Portsmouth Yard "time out of mind."&#x2014;The workmen are paid quarterly, but are always one quarter in arrear at the least, being paid 3 months wages when 6 are due. As soon after the expiration of a quarter as the clerk of the Checque can collect the different notes or vouchers for the allowance of extra wages to the workmen, they are setoff on the Muster Books, either in characters or money, and the different numbers of days, nights, and tides, which have been worked by each man respectively summed up, and the amount of the wages for the quarter set against their names; the Pay Books are then made out, which express the time for which the payment is made, the men's names, the number of days, nights, and tides, they have been employed in the quarter, and the total amount of their wages. The pay books are signed by the Clerk of the Checque; but it has been stated to us by that officer, that his time is so wholly engrossed by the other duties of his station, as not to allow his giving them any examination previous to affixing his signature to them, upon the faith of which alone the payments are made, without the Books being previously transmitted to the Navy Board for examination and correction.&#x2014;The Pay Books are ultimately forwarded to the Navy Office, but rather as vouchers for the payments made by the Treasurer of the Navy, than with any view to their being audited; indeed it is impossible at present that any effectual examination can take place, as the Pay Books contain only the gross number of days, nights, and tides, the workmen have been employed, and the full amount of their wages, and the Muster Books and Vouchers, which would shew in what manner the total amount of the time and wages are made up, have never been transmitted to the Board.</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01760">When the Amount of the Wages of the Workmen in the Dock Yards, and the great increase which has taken place of late years are considered, it is scarcely to be credited that the Navy Board should have suffered sums of such magnitude to have been disbursed upon the faith of the signatures of the Clerks of the Checque in the several Yards, without the Pay Books undergoing any check or examination whatever; and this conduct is in direct opposition to the general practice of the Navy Office in other respects, as the Pay Books of the smallest vessel in His Majesty's Service arc examined in three distinct Departments previous to payment being made upon them.&#x2014;From the very loose manner in which the payments of the wages to the workmen in the Dock Yards have been conducted, this subject has not come before the Board in the common course of business; and it appears, by the Examination of the Comptroller of the Navy, that, during the whole of the late war, it was not the object of particular investigation. Indeed, so little attention seems to have been paid to this subject, that three of the Members of the Navy Board out of the four whom we examined, were very uncertain whether the Pay Books of the Yard were checked at the Navy Office or not, previous to the payment.&#x2014;It has been before observed, that there are three assistants to the master shipwright in the general execution of his duty; there are likewise inferior officers of the shipwrights and caulkers, which branches are the most important in a Dock Yard, and are considered to be more immediately within the province of the master shipwright.&#x2014;Over each of the other classes, though under the general superintendence of the master shipwright, a master workman is appointed, who conducts and directs the execution of the work.&#x2014;Under the

<p id="S1V0003P0-01762">By the above Account it appears, that, although the shipwrights established rate of daily pay has not been altered for upwards of a century, their actual wages have been gradually on the increase since the year 1758, and that they have been more than doubled since that time. Our reason for requiring the Statement for the years 1758 and 1780, was to compare their wages in the most active years of former wars, with their wages during the last war.&#x2014;We have been induced to state the average wages paid for the working days, in order to shew clearly the increase which has taken place of late years. On a cursory examination of the above and similar calculations, it may be conceived, as the workmen are frequently employed on Sundays, and the average we have formed being for the 313 days only that it exceeds the wages actually paid to them; but that certainly is not the case, and we consider it to be a low average, inasmuch as we believe the time lost by the workmen, by</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01764">The following Statement will shew the average number of shipwrights employed in Plymouth Yard, and the amount of their wages in the years stated, with their several allowances:</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01765">being absent from the Yard from sickness and other causes, to be fully equal to their employment on Sundays, and such average is further reduced by the number of persons entered and discharged in the course of the year, who have not received pay for the whole time.&#x2014;That the wages actually paid to the shipwrights exceeded such average, is proved by their having been employed at the rate of 3 for 1 during most part of the year 1801, which made their wages 6s. 3d. a day, besides occasional extra, whereas the average stated is only 5s. 5&#x00BD;d&#x2014;The shipwrights are formed into gangs or companies, over whom an inferior officer is placed, called a quarterman; each of which gangs, according to the directions of the Navy Board, should consist of twenty persons; the task, gangs are directed to consist of the quarter-man, 15 men, and 4 apprentices, who are termed Servants in the Dock Yards; but the number of men and apprentices in the other gangs depends upon the proportion which
<image src="S1V0003P0I0505"/>
<col>981</col>
the apprentices bear to the working shipwrights. After the task gangs are formed, the quartermen have the selection of their respective companies; each, according to his seniority, nominating 1 man in turn, beginning with those who have apprentices&#x2014;There is a class of officers between the quartermen and assistants, called foremen of the shipwrights, of whom there are five in Plymouth Yard; 2 superintend the repairs of ships carrying on in the Docks; 2 superintend the several works carrying on afloat; and the other has the direction and superintendence of the ships buildintr.&#x2014;The shipwrights were employed by the day, working such occasional extra as the service required, until the year 1788. In the 7 years war, ending in 1762, the artificers were generally employed 2 tides, or 3 hours extra, but on particular emergencies, five hours. In the peace which succeeded, they were not employed any extra for nearly two years, and during the remainder of that peace, they were employed 1 tide, or an hour and a half extra in the summer months only, except in the armament of 1770, when considerable; exertions were made.&#x2014;During the American war, they were generally employed two tides, and occasionally 1 night extra; and on the return of peace, 1 tide extra during the summer months only.&#x2014;From the general tenor of the orders of the Navy Board about this time, there is great reason to believe, that their inducement for allowing the artificers during peace to work l title extra, was rather to add to their daily wages, than on account of any extra exertion being required; and in support of this opinion, we find that on the 3d of Feb. 1775, they submitted to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, a Plan for building ships in the King's Yards, and carrying on the works of those that might require considerable Repair, by Task; and one of the principal advantages slated to be expected to result to the public from its adoption, was, "that it would effectually put a stop to the clamour for a general increase of wages, as it would, in effect, be an increase to the able and deserving men, without increasing it to the unable; and it was feared that a general increase of wages, in any other mode, would not have the same salutary ends in increasing the dispatch of the work."&#x2014;The Navy Board in their proposal also stated, that, previous to the year 1775, various attempts had been made to introduce the mode of employing the shipwrights by task without success, and that the failure was to be attributed to the want of well-regulated
<col>982</col>
plans for carrying it into effect, and to an apprehension that the workmanship might not be well performed.&#x2014;The plan was approved by the Admiralty, and the Navy Board in consequence gave directions for its being carried into execution, by warrant, dated the 23d of March 1775, which contained a Code of Regulations for that purpose.&#x2014;A certain price per ton was fixed by the Navy Board to be allowed to the artificers for building a Ship of each Class; and the work was divided into 25 Articles or Sections, to each of which a price was set proportionate to the sum allowed for the whole.&#x2014;The shipwrights were directed to be new shoaled, and the most able formed into gangs to be employed by task; they were to be held subject to the same musters, checques, and mulcts, as those employed by day work; and on no pretence whatever to be permitted to go out of the Yard gate within the working hours, nor to go to work before those hours, nor remain at work after them.&#x2014;The Navy Board, in their Warrant to the officers, stated, that the surveyor had devoted considerable care and attention in fixing the prices for the several articles, and had availed himself of the opinion of the officers of the several Yards as to the number of men, for 1 day, which might be proper to complete each article; but we have been unable to ascertain satisfactorily on what "Data" of daily pay the calculation of the prices was formed. The Surveyors of the Navy are of opinion that the rate of pay taken as "Data" in forming the calculation, was 2 for 1, or 4s. 2d.; but as by the Warrant the quartermen and foremen were only to have two tides extra, in addition to their daily pay, we do not think that they are correct in their supposition, as it is reasonable to conclude the Navy Board would have given an increase of wages to the subordinate officers in the same proportion as to the working men; whereas, if the prices were fixed on the basis of 2 for 1, the men would receive 4s. 2d. a day, and the quartermen only 3s. 9d. We therefore applied to the only Commissioner who was a member of the Navy Board at the time of the introduction of task work, and who had been brought up in the civil department of the service; but it appeared, upon his examination, that lie was altogether unacquainted with the subject.&#x2014;Notwithstanding the plan appears to have been very advantageous to the shipwrights, yet it was resisted by them; and the reason urged against it was, that in case any timber proved defective or unfit for use, when fashioned to its intended shape, no
<image src="S1V0003P0I0506"/>
<col>983</col>
compensation was provided for the workmanship performed on such materials.&#x2014;The plan being persisted in, they struck work, and were in consequence discharged from the Yard on the 29th of June 1775; but were re-entered on the 21st of Aug. following, and allowed the option of working either by task or day work.&#x2014;The prices for task work were revised, and some alterations made in the scheme by the Navy Board's Warrants of 22d Aug. 1775, and the 3d of May 1776, since which no alteration in either has taken place; it appears, however, from the result of our enquiry, that a further revision is necessary, the prices for building large ships being fixed too high, and for small ships too low, and consequently the men's earnings are very disproportionate, though, upon an average, the prices are fully adequate; as the amount of their wages, when employed by task, has been from 4s. 2d. to 6s. 6d. a day.&#x2014;The Warrant of the 22d of Aug. 1773, was intended to do away the objections urged by the shipwrights to this mode of working; it directed, that they should be paid a daily rate of wages for the time that might be lost in the conversion of unsound materials, and in the performance of some extra works; it likewise directed, that they should have assistance in the heavy work of getting in the beams.&#x2014;The points thus yielded by the Board, were directed to to be made known to the artificers, in order that they might have full information of the encouragement held out to them "of a large increase of earnings within the common working hours:" but notwithstanding this encouragement, the shipwrights persisted in their refusal to work by task until the year 1788, when it is said to have been adopted at their solicitation, and has been since continued whenever the works carrying on have allowed the shipwrights to be so employed.&#x2014;The shipwrights on task work have been confined in their time of working to the common hours of the Yard, except when they may occasionally have been employed on any particular work which could not be left in an unfinished state; but although employed by the piece at fixed prices, their earnings have in some instances been limited to 4s 2d. or twice the amount of their established daily pay.&#x2014;As the men employed by task were confined in their time of working to the common hours of the Yard, we can see no good reason why any restriction should have been laid upon the amount of their earnings, provided the prices established were fair and equitable, especially as we consider the number of Officers fully suf-
<col>984</col>
ficient to have seen that the work was well and substantially performed.&#x2014;In the year 1783, in consequence, as is stated, of an application from the shipwrights in some of his Majesty's Yards, the Navy Board proposed to the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to employ the effective shipwrights generally by the piece in the repairs of ships, or what they termed job work, in order "to give all fitting encouragement to industrious and deserving men, who, according to this mode, might benefit themselves by a due exertion of their strength and abilities."&#x2014;We have before stated generally, that job work consisted of repairs; but in the regulations respecting task work, it was directed, that if any one entire article or section of work should arise in the repair of ships, it should be performed by task.&#x2014;The proposal for job work being approved by the Admiralty, the Navy Board directed, by their Warrant of the 3d Dec. 1783 to the officers of his Majesty's several Dock Yards, that the shipwrights should be so employed, under the following regulations:&#x2014;1. No job was to be undertaken until it had been first valued by the master shipwright and his assistants; the price so set upon it was to be examined by the clerk of the checque, and compared with precedents, or the prices allowed for works as nearly correspondent thereto as possible. When the valuation was settled, the workmen were to be employed upon the job, without waiting for particular orders from the Board, as they trusted that the officers, for the sake of their own reputation, as well as in justice to the public, would, to the best of their skill and judgment, set equitable prices:&#x2014;2. An account of the particulars and valuation of the jobs so taken in hand, was nevertheless to be sent to the Board immediately, under the hands of the officers before mentioned, hi order to their being confirmed, if approved of fully; or that the Board might point out such articles as needed alteration in future cases of the like nature.&#x2014;3. By these means, the Navy Board state, they had no doubt but that in a short time, just and equitable rates would be found out for almost every possible case, so that his Majesty might have the full benefit of the men's time, and the workmen be paid to the full for their labour.&#x2014;By this Warrant it was likewise directed, that the shipwrights employed by the piece or job work, should not, without special order, be permitted to remain in the Yard more than the usual working hours, and that their earnings should be limited from the 1st of Oct. to the 31st of March,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0507"/>
<col>985</col>
to 1 day and 1 tide, or 2s. 8&#x00BD;d. a day; and from the 1st of April to the 30th of Sept. to 1 day and 2 tides, or 3s. 4d. a day.&#x2014;We think that the Navy Board, before they directed the shipwrights to be employed by job, should have established prices by which the earnings were to be ascertained; the allowing them generally under the plea of working by the piece in the common hours of the Yard, to have more than the established rate of pay, can be considered only as granting them an increase of daily pay; as it follows naturally that the prices to be set on the different works by the officers, would be so fixed, that the men might, by ordinary exertion, earn the advance of pay granted.&#x2014;The shipwrights of Plymouth Yard were at this time very averse to the mode of working by the piece, and the plan for employing them by job, as well as by task, was in con-</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01769">sequence not carried into effect until the year 1788.&#x2014;It appears that the first ship repaired by job in Plymouth Yard, was the Gibraltar of 80 guns; on which occasion, the officers reported to the Navy Board the works necessary to be performed, previous to their being taken in hand; the number of men intended to be employed on the work; the time in which it ought to be performed; and the sum of money they judged proper to be allowed for it; of which the following is a copy:</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01770"><i>"Plymouth Yard,</i> 15<i>th Nov.</i> 1788.</p>

<image src="S1V0003P0I0508"/>
<col>987</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01774">On the 11th of Jan. 1791, the Navy Board directed the officers of Plymouth Yard not to employ the artificees by job until further order; but on the 13th of the same month, they authorized the officers to employ the shipwrights by job in the summer months only, limiting their earnings to 1 day and 2 tides, or 3s. 4d.; during the rest of the year they were to be employed by day work, at the established rate of pay.&#x2014;Although the Navy Board, by the latter Warrant, authorized the employment of the shipwrights by job, it by no means became general, even in the summer months, until the 8th of Jan. 1793, when the Navy Board issued a Warrant to the officers of Plymouth Yard (grounded on a proposal from them) to employ the shipwrights 2 for 1 by job, in the common working hours, including their dinner time, on the ships tilting out; and, on account of the pressure of business, dispensed with the propositions of the prices to be allowed, "trusting that the officers "would take care the service reaped an advantage equivalent thereto." The Navy Board, by this Warrant, which continued in force until Oct.1794, dispensed with the only document by which they could judge of the effect which the encouragement given to the men to exert themselves by the increase of wages might produce upon the quantum of work performed; and threw the whole responsibility of the public receiving an advantage, adequate to the expense incurred, upon the master shipwright. During this period, it is slated, that the work performed was taken account of, and that the men were allowed the extra wages, upon certificates given by the master shipwright to the Clerk of the Cheque, that their earnings had amounted to the rates of pay allowed.&#x2014;As the Navy Board in all their orders respecting job work had limited the earnings of the shipwrights to a less sum in winter than summer, on account, we apprehend, of the difference in the length of the days, we are at a loss to understand upon what principle they varied from it, and authorized the officers, in Jan. 1793, to employ them generally at the rate of 2 for 1. If job work, as it has been stated to us, was intended to be an employment "bon&#x00E2; fide" by the piece, the same rate of earnings should not have been fixed for winter and summer, as the same quantity of work could not be done in the former as in the latter season&#x2014;On the 7th of Oct. 1794, the Navy Board, by Warrant, directed the mode in which the artificers and labourers
<col>988</col>
were to be employed, and fixed the extent of wages which they were to be allowed; permitting the efficient artificers of most of the classes to receive twice the amount of their established daily pay, either by being employed by task or job, or by working such a number of extra hours as would entitle them thereto.&#x2014;By the Warrant of the 8th of Jan. 1793, the shipwrights, for their double pay, or 4s. 2d. a day, were required to work dining the time allowed them for dinner, which in summer is 2 hours, so that the public for this increase of pay gained some extra employment; but in the warrant of the 7th of Oct. 1794, directing that the shipwrights working by task or job should have double days pay, the Navy Board revived their former restriction on that head; "that task and job should be "wrought in the common working hours, "as originally established;" and the officers were not to deviate from this rule, without particular directions: this Warrant therefore deprived the public of that extra employment, and actually doubled the daily rate of pay of the shipwrights, giving them 4s. 2d. a day for working in the usual hours of the Yard.&#x2014;It was however directed, that, notwithstanding the orders which had been given for dispensing with the propositions, the officers were to propose to the Navy Board, from time to time, such task or job work as they might think it right the shipwrights should be employed upon, together with the prices to be allowed, either prior to the taking such work in hand, or at the end of every month, for the Board's approval, and orders thereon.&#x2014;It may be said that this Warrant, although it allowed the shipwright wages might amount to 4s. 2d. a day, yet, by requiring the propositions or accounts of the work performed, it provided that the officers should make it appear to the satisfaction of the Navy Board, that the work done was equal to the wages paid; this leads to a consideration of the manner in which such accounts had been made up.&#x2014;The various works performed by the shipwrights, when employed by job, have been in the first instance taken account of by the quarterman of each gang, who delivered the same to the foreman of the shipwrights under whom he acted; in the office of the foreman, the accounts of the several quartermen were brought together, and the works on each ship arranged in their proper order, and entered in a rough book: prices were then affixed to each article, either by the foreman or the persons employed
<image src="S1V0003P0I0509"/>
<col>989</col>
under him, which were submitted to the assistant to the master shipwright, under whose superintendence the repairs of the ship had been placed, for his approval or correction; and after the prices had received his approbation, the fair proposition, in the form before specified, was copied from the book, and laid before the master shipwright for his signature when corrected, or approved; it was afterwards signed by the assistants and the clerk of the checque, and forwarded to the Navy Board. These propositions, it appears, have been fallacious even from the first introduction of job work, for instead of entering the exact number of men employed upon the several jobs, a fictitious number has been inserted, calculated from the amount of the prices proposed to be allowed; this, we apprehend, has been done in order to make it appear to the Navy Board, that the men have earned the rate of wages authorized and actually paid.&#x2014;It may be proper to describe the situations of the persons employed in taking and checking these accounts: the daily rate of pay of the quartermen was established at the same time as that of the shipwrights, at 2s. 6d. a day, and they have had an emolument arising from the wages of an apprentice, whose pay in the first year of his apprenticeship is 1s. 2d. a day, and advances, according to the length of his service, to 1s. 10d.: when the shipwrights were first directed to be employed by the piece, the Navy Board directed that the pay of the quartermen should be independent of the earnings of their gangs, and that they should be allowed two tides extra, in addition to their established pay. By Warrant of the 13th of March, 1804, this plan was altered, and they were permitted to have the same extra as the working men, not exceeding 2 for 1, or double pay; and by Warrant of the 22d of May, 1797, this restriction was taken off, and they were allowed the full extra wrought by the shipwrights when employed more than the common hours by the piece or job. The extra pay of the apprentices to the quartermen was governed by the rate of earnings of the men with whom they were employed.&#x2014;Thus it appears, that by the alterations from the original plan, the interest and duty of the quartermen, who were to take the accounts of the work performed by the shipwrights, were set at variance, and a powerful inducement to favour the men excited, by rendering their pay and emoluments dependent wholly on the accounts they might render of the work per-
<col>990</col>
formed by the men whom they superintended.&#x2014;The foremen of the shipwrights, who were to check these accounts, and affix prices to the work, stood exactly in the same situation as the quartermen; they were paid at a rate of daily wages, with the indulgence of 2 apprentices; their rate of pay was increased by the same Warrants, and in the same ratio as that of the quartermen, and the amount of the pay of their apprentices was likewise governed by the rate of earnings of the people with whom they were employed.&#x2014;The assistants to the master shipwright, and even the master shipwright himself, to whose inspection these accounts were ultimately subject, had likewise an interest in favouring the workmen; as the most considerable part of their emoluments was derived from the pay of a certain number or apprentices, which was encreased or diminished according as the earnings of the men fluctuated.&#x2014;Although we cannot assert that these inducements actually operated with the officers in giving to the men greater wages than they considered them justly entitled to, yet it appears by the evidence, that the apprentices to the officers have been certified by them to have been employed upon task and job work, in order to increase their rate of wages, when they have been employed in drawing or writing in the offices or their masters. The emolument to the officers, arising from the pay of their apprentices, was abolished by the order of his Majesty in council, dated the 28th of May, 1801, and fixed annual salaries given to them in lieu of all perquisites and emoluments whatever; this regulation was afterwards extended to the foremen of the shipwrights; but the quartermen are still paid according to the earnings of the men, of whose work they render accounts.&#x2014;It appears by the evidence of the assistants and foremen, that their examination of the quartermen's accounts (where any has taken place) has been extremely superficial; that it was directed merely to the principal articles of the work, not taken down in writing, but for which they trusted wholly to their memory; of course the large sums of money annually paid to the shipwrights have been disbursed upon the faith of the accounts rendered by the quartermen, who had, and still have, the powerful inducement before-mentioned to swerve from their duty.&#x2014;The prices set by the officers against the several works in the propositions were examined at the Navy Office, and, if approved by the Board, a Warrant was issued
<image src="S1V0003P0I0510"/>
<col>991</col>
on each proposition, directing the clerk of the checque to set off the wages of the shipwrights employed on the job, according to the proposition; but in case any of the prices were altered, such alterations were stated in the Warrant, and the clerk of the checque was directed to govern himself thereby in setting off the wages of the men.&#x2014;Notwithstanding this appearance of precision, and the semblance of an actual employment and payment by the piece, no attention whatever was paid by the officers either to the propositions made to the Navy Board, or to the Warrants given by them in consequence; but the whole of the shipwrights employed by job were paid the utmost extent of wages authorized by the Navy Board, upon the authority of a general note from the master shipwright to the clerk of the checque. By these means the shipwrights, though nominally employed by job, were virtually employed by the day, at the advanced wages of 4s. 2d. for working in the common hours; which led us to enquire in whom the power of increasing the wages of the workmen in his Majesty's naval service was vested.&#x2014;By the evidence of the several members of the Navy Board whom we examined, and a report from the Board of Admiralty, we learned that this power is vested in his Majesty in council; and on requiring from the Navy Board a copy of the order from the Admiralty first authorizing the employment of the artificers by job, and of any orders which might have been given to them since that period for employing them at the rate of 2 for 1 in the common working hours, we received a copy of the order from the Admiralty (and of the proposal from the Navy Board on which it was grounded) which first authorized the Navy Board to employ them by job, at the rate of single day and 2 tides in summer, and single day and 1 tide in winter; and as the authority upon which they directed them to be employed at the rate of 2 for 1 in the common working hours, they furnished us with copies of various Orders from the Admiralty, none of which are applicable to the point in question, but appear to have been given at different times of emergency, and merely direct generally, that the artificers should be employed as much extra as possible, with advantage to the service, meaning certainly extra time; and having no regard whatever to what was to be the amount of the men's wages for their common day's labour. Although the fixed rate of daily pay had been encreased to a certain extent
<col>992</col>
by employing the workmen by the piece, with the approbation of the Admiralty, yet it appears the Navy Board directed them to be employed at the rate of 2 for 1 in the common working hours, without consulting the Admiralty; and under such circumstances, we are of opinion, they should have taken especial care that work was done (according to the prices approved by themselves) equal to the wages paid to the workmen; and we think it will be clearly demonstrated in the course of this Report, that the advance given by the Warrant of the 7th of Oct. 1794, was in many instances profuse, and productive of various abuses, by the manner in which it was granted.&#x2014;Between the 30th Jan. and 4th of July, 1797, the Shipwrights, as well as several other classes of workmen, were employed at the rate of two for one, and two tides by Job, in the common working hours of the Yard, including their dinner time, and a considerable part of the time one night extra after bell-ringing, on a proposal from the master shipwright to the commissioner, which was approved by the Navy Board; this rate of working made the pay of the shipwrights 7s. 6d. a day; and, considering the time of year when it was carried into effect, it cannot be supposed that work adequate thereto could have been performed. From 12th Jan. 1793, to 7th Oct. 1794, the shipwrights were employed by job, at the rate of two for one, including their dinner time; but in the period above-mentioned, the shipwrights received 1s. 3d. for working their dinner time, or for one hour and a half's additional employment, at which rate their common day's labour alone would have amounted to 8s. 4d. It has been a practice, from the establishment of the Yard, to give the shipwrights, when employed in extra time, a double rate of pay to that fixed for the common time of labour. And as, when the men have been employed during their dinner time, it has been considered as extra, they have, except in the instance before stated, had one tide, or 7&#x00BD;d. for such extra labour, which is at the rate of double their established daily pay; so that when the Navy Board approved of their having two tides, or 1s. 3d. for working their dinner time, they were paid for such extra labour at a quadruple rate to that fixed for the common day's work; by this circumstance the shipwrights alone, between the 30th of Jan. and 4th July, 1797, were paid for their labour in their dinner time about 4000l. beyond the established compensation for suck
<image src="S1V0003P0I0511"/>
<col>993</col>
extra employment, which appears never to have been varied from but in this instance.&#x2014;On the 28th of Nov. 1798, upon a proposal from the officers, in which they stated the pressing nature of the works carrying on, the Navy Board directed by warrant, that the workmen should be employed two tides, that is, 3 hours extra after bell-ringing; and on the 28th of Jan. 1801, they directed that the artificers in general should be employed one night, that is 5 hours extra, in addition to the the two for one by Job they were then working in the common hours.&#x2014;Upon the receipt of each of these warrants, a general note was given by the master shipwrights the clerk of the checque, stating that the workmen were to be employed two for one by Job in the common working hours, and the extra directed by the warrants of the Navy Board, until further order; on the authority of which notes they were so set off, and paid accordingly 5s. 5d. a day in the first instance, and 6s. 3d. in the latter, without any regard whatever to the quantity or value of the work performed.&#x2014;Accounts were, however, continued to be taken by the quartermen, as heretofore, of the work performed by their respective gangs, and propositions of the Jobs, in the usual form, with the prices set by the officers upon the different articles, were sent to the Navy Board for their approval. In the head of each proposition, it was generally stated to be a Job for so many men a certain number of double days; and the total amount of the value of the work on each Job, as rated by the officers, in general corresponded very nearly with the sum which the wages of the number of men stated to have been employed, would amount to, calculated at the rate of double days.&#x2014;These propositions were cither approved by the Navy Board, or such alterations were made in the prices as they judged proper, and warrants were continued to be given, to setoff the wages of the men accordingly; but these warrants had no influence on the conduct of the officers, as the wages were set off on the authority of the general notes given by the master shipwright; and, in some instances, the men were paid previous to the propositions having received the sanction of the Navy Board, or previous even to their having been transmitted to them for that purpose.&#x2014;We were very much surprized to find, that, during the time the warrants of the 28th of Nov. 1798, and the 28th of Jan. 1801, were in force, the propositions made to the Navy Board stated the
<col>994</col>
Jobs to be for double days, and that the value of the work performed, had, according to the propositions, only amounted to the wages of the shipwrights employed, at the rate of double days, or 4s. 2d. a day; when, under these warrants, they were working considerable extra, and paid 5s. 5d. and 6s. 3d. a day; we were therefore led to enquire whether such accounts or propositions contained the whole of the work that was performed by the shipwrights for the wages paid to them, or what account was taken of the work done in the extra time, and whether the value of such work was compared with the amount of the extra wages; when we learnt that the officers had considered it to have been the intention of the Navy Board, that the shipwrights should be employed by the piece during the common working hours only, and that they should be paid the extra according to the additional number of hours they remained in the Yard: but as no separate accounts were taken by which the work done in the common hours could be distinguished from that in the extra time, it could only be determined whether any, and to what amount, work was performed for the extra wages, by the excess of the value of the whole work performed above what was equal to the wages of the men at two for one; and we have reason to believe, indeed it is hereafter proved by several comparative statements, that the sums I aid for this supposed extra work were almost entirely lost to the public, as the value of the work performed seldom much exceeded the amount of the mens' wages at two for one.&#x2014;It has been stated to us by the chief clerk in the office of the Clerk of the Checque, who had the principal management of that department during the late war, owing to the age and infirmities of the Clerk of the Checque, who has been since superannuated, that the wages of the men were set off without waiting for the directions of the Navy Board, in order to prevent delay in making up the Pay Books of the Yard; and that, as the different Orders of the Navy Board respecting Task and Job work had directed that such work should be performed in the common working hours, the Navy Board's warrants of the 28th Nov. 1798, and the 28th of Jan. 1801, for employing the workmen extra after bell-ringing, were understood to mean, that such extra was to be independent of the Job work performed in the common day hours, and was intended as an inducement to the men to exert themselves as much as possible, in consideration
<image src="S1V0003P0I0512"/>
<col>995</col>
of the additional wages they would receive:&#x2014;The Warrants of the 28th of Nov. 1798, and the 28th of Jan. 1801, are very loosely Worded, and appear to have been hastily constructed, without reference to the Standing Regulations of the Board on their relative subjects: This, we must observe, has been too generally practised of late years in framing the orders of that Board; yet we consider the officers interpretation of those warrants has been very much overstrained, to give some degree of colour to the manner in which they have acted under them. The warrants certainly do not stale in what mode the artificers were to be employed in the extra time, whether by Task and Job, or Day work; but the orders of the Board then in force were, that the whole of the shipwrights, excepting such only as were disabled by hurts or infirmities, should be employed by Task and Job. The restriction stated, that this mode of working was to be confined to the common hours, (it will appear by a reference to the warrants) cannot, by the most forced construction, be made to bear allusion to a circumstance not then in contemplation, nor perhaps foreseen; the directions that Task or Job should only be wrought in the common hours Were given when the shipwrights were not employed beyond those hours, and appear to have been meant only as a provision, that if, from idleness or any other causes, any of the shipwrights had not completed their Task at the time of the bell ringing for the people to be mustered out of the Yard, they should not be permitted to remain to complete it. To prove that, however ambiguously the warrants may have been worded, the construction said to have been put upon them by the officers could not have been formed at the time, and that it was positively the intention of the Navy Board, when they extended the number of hours which the shipwrights should remain at work, that they should in such extra hours be employed by the piece, it is only necessary to adduce the Warrant given by the Board on the 22d of May 1797, for allowing extra to the foremen and quartermen in proportion to the earnings of the working men, which directs, that those officers "shall be allowed for their attendance, when the artificers <i>work more than</i> <i>"the common hours by the Piece or Job,</i> the "same extra as the men."&#x2014;Notwithstanding the conduct of the officers, in allowing to the artificers such a considerable portion of extra wages, without taking any Steps to ascertain that work was performed equal
<col>996</col>
thereto, has been endeavoured to be palliated by a misconstruction of the warrants, yet we find, that they acted on the warrants of the 28th of Nov. 1798 and the 28th of Jan. 1801, in exact conformity to their practice under the warrant of the 7th of Oct. 1794, (which could not be subject to the same misinterpretation)&#x2014;the master shipwright, by giving a note to the Clerk of the Checque, for setting off the wages of the artificers at the rate specified In the warrants; and the Clerk of the Checque, by setting them off on the authority of and in conformity to that note, without any regard whatever to the value of the works performed. The employment, therefore, of the shipwrights by the Job or Piece, in the common working hours, has been merely nominal, as they have in fact been employed wholly by the day, and, under these wan-ants', received for their labour 5s. 11d. and 6s. 9d. a day, including the allowance in lieu of their chips.&#x2014;At the same time that we learned from the officers, that no separate account was taken of the work done by the shipwrights in the extra time, we were given to understand, that the propositions sent to the Navy Board did not include all the work performed by them for the wages they received: For, although it was stated by all the persons we examined, that the shipwrights were employed in the extra time on the same jobs as during the common hours; and that when the quartermen came to measure and take account of the work, it was impossible for them to make any distinction between that performed in the common hours, and in the extra time; yet it was urged by some, that, as the quartermen were aware it was only necessary for them, in order to procure the full rate of wages for themselves and people, to state in their accounts such a quantity of work as would, according to the prices which might be put on the different articles by the officers, amount to the wages of the men employed at the rate of double days, they were very incorrect in their accounts, and frequently omitted various articles, when they were satisfied their accounts would amount to the double day's pay of the men without them.&#x2014;It was likewise stated, that the people employed under the foremen of the shipwrights in keeping the job accounts, when they had set a value upon the different articles in the rough book, into which the quartermen's accounts were copied, and found that the amount exceeded the wages of the men employed at the rate of double days, were in the practice of striking out va-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0513"/>
<col>997</col>
rious articles, in order to make the amount correspond as nearly as possible with the wages of the men at that rate, and which articles, so struck out, were omitted in the fair propositions to the Navy Board.&#x2014;As it appeared to us extremely important to ascertain these points with precision&#x2014;(the conclusion, whether the men were properly or improperly paid, during a great part of the late war, resting wholly upon the correctness with which the accounts of the work had been kept)&#x2014;we examined very particularly George Bone and Robert Wonnicott, shipwrights, who had been employed under the foremen in writing the Job accounts, the former about 9 years, and the latter between 5 and 6; and four of the most intelligent quartermen.&#x2014;George Bone and Robert Wonnicott both agree in their evidence, that when the accounts of the quartermen were delivered into the foreman's office, the works were classed, and the whole entered in the rough Job books, previous to prices being set against any of the articles; that when the total amount has exceeded the wages of the men employed, calculated at the rate of double days, the foremen have lined out some articles of trifling amount to save trouble in the writing, and which were omitted in the propositions: The total value of the articles so omitted, they both stated, were in general of very small amount; and the latter, that the articles omitted were in general so trifling, that it was hardly possible to fix a price for the labour on them.&#x2014;Geo. Bone, in corroboration of his testimony, stated, that by a reference to the Rough Job books, which had been kept by him in the office of one of the foremen, the nature and value of the articles which h3d been struck out and omitted in the propositions to the Navy Board would be seen. We therefore caused them to be laid before us, and upon examination, it appeared, that it had not been a general practice to line out articles of work performed, and that the articles so lined out were in most cases of trifling value.&#x2014;The books kept by Robert Wonnicott, in the office of the other foreman of the Yard, have not been preserved; on the superannuation of that foreman, all the Job books were carried to his house by his directions, who at the time stated as a reason for this measure, that it was "for his own "Security in case any Examination on this "Subject should ever take place."&#x2014;It will appear, by the evidence of James Campbell, John Sumpter, John Barrett, and William Eathorne, the four quartermen, that no di-
<col>998</col>
stinction was ever made by them of the work performed by their respective gangs in the common day hours, and in the extra time; but that they invariably took account of the whole work performed by the men from the time of their coming into the Yard in the morning to their quitting it in the evening, which they did with as much correctness as possible; and that they never omitted any articles in their accounts; which, by a certificate signed by all the quartermen of the Yard, transmitted by the officers to the Navy Beard, appeals to have been the general practice.&#x2014;In the instances where the value of the work has appeared to exceed, in any considerable degree, the amount of the wages of the men employed, at the rate of double days, or 4s. 2d. a day, it is stated to have arisen from a fallacy in the accounts, by reporting, as having been performed by a few men, what required the assistance of a considerable number. For instance, where a few men have been employed on the repairs of a ship which may have sustained trifling injury in the bottom, it has been necessary to employ a considerable number, for a short time, for the purpose of raising and suspending the ship on shores, in order to get at the keel. For this service a considerable sum has been set down in the accounts; but as no notice has been taken of the additional number of men employed to perform that service, the whole sum appears, by the accounts, to have been earned by the men permanently employed on the Job.&#x2014;Upon a consideration of the evidence, it appeared, that, during the time the shipwrights were employed extra under the authority of the warrants of the 23th Nov. 1798, and 28th Jan. 1801, they had been very considerably overpaid. With a view therefore to ascertain with precision the amount of the sum overpaid on any given work, we required a List of the Names of the Ships which had received considerable repair in the last years of the war; and having been furnished therewith, we issued our precept for an account, shewing the amount of the whole works performed by the shipwrights to those ships, as valued by the officers; the amount approved by the Navy Board; the Number of Men, and the Number of Days they were employed; and the Amount of the Wages which had been actually paid to them whilst employed on the Jobs, in consequence of the general notes of the master shipwright before alluded to.&#x2014;Wishing to have this Account as correct as possible, we directed that the actual number of ship-

wrights by whom the Jobs had been performed should be clearly stated, in order that the wages paid to them might be precisely ascertained; for, in the Accounts kept in the Yard, of the gangs of shipwrights employed on the different services, it had been the practice to include all the persons belonging to the gangs, although some of them were not employed on the works; such as the, shipwrights who kept the Job Accounts under the foremen, those employed in drawing, and in the mould loft, termed "Stationed Men," but who were borne as effective shipwrights in the different gangs, in order that they might receive similar wages to the shipwrights employed at their Tools on Job work; whereas, had they been described as single Stationed Men, they would have been entitled only to the established rate of daily</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01776">Thus, on the Repairs of seven ships only, no less a sum than 5,623l. 0s. 9d. appears to have been overpaid to the Shipwrights alone, being at the rate of 221. 11s. 9d. per cent. above the value of the work, at the prices approved by the Navy Board; and there is too much reason to apprehend from this comparison, that during the time the shipwrights were employed extra beyond the common working hours, from the 28th Nov. 1798 to the 12th Oct. 1801, the greater part of the sum paid to them on that account, which, according to the best calculation we can make, has amounted to 68,331l. has, from the misconduct of the officers of the Yard, and the want of attention in the controuling power, been paid to the injury of the public; and it must seem extraordinary, that in no instance the Navy Board should have compared the value of the work with the wages actually paid to the men for performing it.&#x2014;Before the officers decided so important a question, as, whether the artificers during the extra hours which the Board authorized their being employed, should ab-
<col>1000</col>
pay, with the allowance of extra for the time they stayed in the Yard beyond the common working hours. If the shipwrights had been paid actually by the piece, this measure would have been a great injustice to the men, as those who did not work at their tools would have participated in the earnings of those who did; but under the general notes given by the master shipwright, the whole of the shipwrights not on Task work were paid the same rate of wages, however they might be employed.&#x2014;By the Account rendered by the officers, it appears that Over-Payments, to a considerable amount, have been made to the shipwrights employed on each of the ships that underwent a considerable Repair in the years 1800 and 1801; as the following Statement, taker, from the Account, will shew.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01777">solutely earn the extra wages allowed to them, or that it should be given to them without any regard to the work they might perform, and in such a way as to render it impossible to keep any check against their earnings in the common day hours, when they were supposed to be employed and paid by the piece, it was surely their duty to have applied for the further directions of the Board; and indeed it is impossible to conceive how (his circumstance could, for so considerable a length of time, have escaped the detection of the Navy Board.&#x2014;Propositions or Accounts of all (he work performed, were regularly transmitted, in which it was constantly reported, that the Jobs were for double days only, and the amount of the Propositions corresponded with the amount of the wages of the number of men stated, calculated at the rate of double days: although the orders given by the Board for employing the men extra might have escaped their recollection, yet the subject must have been constantly brought before them by the progress of the works in hand, trans-

mitted to them weekly, in which the rate the men were working was inserted, and consequently between the 28th Nov. 1798 and 12th Oct. 1801, they stated that the shipwrights were employed two tides and one night extra. If these documents had been compared, as the Navy Board supposed the artificers to be employed the whole time by Job, and the Propositions contained all the work performed, it must have resulted, that the men were paid the extra without any work being performed for it.&#x2014;But if the Navy Board, as has been stated to us by the Comptroller, considered the propositions only as rates, and that when the men worked extra, separate accounts were taken of such work, which were not transmitted to them, they should at least have called for the Account of the Work performed in the extra time, for the purpose of examining the prices, to see that the men had earned the money paid to them.&#x2014;The reason that the amount of the Propositions made to the Navy Board always corresponded with the amount of the wages of the number of men stated, calculated at the rate of two for one, was owing to a practice of inserting a fictitious number of men, governed by the amount of the Propositions; as this practice is said to have obtained from the commencement of Job Work, there is reason to believe the work fell short of the wages paid, even when the men were employed only two for one, particularly in winter, as we cannot conceive what other cause could have given rise to so fallacious a practice: for as the numbers of men actually employed were known, it was easier to have inserted the real number, than to have made calculations for the purpose of entering a fictitious one.&#x2014;From the evidence of some of the officers who had been lately appointed, and who during the last war were employed in his Majesty's Yard at Portsmouth, it appears that the shipwrights of that Yard were employed in the extra time upon the same Jobs assuring the common hours, and that no steps were taken to ascertain whether the men had actually earned the wages for the extra time. Upon examining the Propositions made by the officers of the several Yards to the Navy Board, we were very much surprized to find, although acting under the same orders, that the Propositions from Portsmouth, Deptford, and Woolwich, contained prices only for the different articles of work, without stating the time or the number of men by whom it had been performed; those from Chatham stated the number
<col>1002</col>
of companies of Shipwrights employed, the number of days, and the extra time the men had worked, as well as the prices; but the number of men in the companies in that Yard has been very different; and the Propositions from Plymouth and Sheerness have stated the prices of the work performed, and the number of men employed for double days only, without stating the extra time the men had worked, so that there appears to have been a total want of system and regularity in the accounts of Job Work; and that the Navy Board could not, by the Propositions sent from any of the Yards, judge whether the value of the work performed was equal to the amount of the wages paid.&#x2014;As the employment of the workmen by Job at Plymouth Yard has been altogether fallacious, it is unaccountable that the officers should not have endeavoured to make the Accounts rendered to the Navy Board of the work performed, correspond with the full amount of the wages paid to the men, as they had authority to set such Prices upon the several articles as they might think fit; and although the Propositions have undergone an examination at the Navy-Office, as to the prices, there is too much reason to conclude, from a circumstance which came accidentally tinder our notice, that it has been more an examination in form than effect.&#x2014;In the Proposition made to the Navy Board in Oct. 1801, for prices to be allowed for the different works performed in the Repairs of his Majesty's ship Canopus, the sum proposed to be given to the Shipwrights for making six stages to the channels was 10l. for each, in the whole 601.; and in Sept. 1802, the sum proposed from the same Yard, by other officers, for the performance of similar work to the Tonnant, a ship of the same class as the Canopus, was 10s. each, only, in the whole 31.; and both these proposals were approved by (he Navy Board, and the above sums, so different in amount, directed by warrants under their hands, to be allowed to the Shipwrights for works exactly similar.&#x2014;The examination of the prices proposed by the officers of the different Yards for Shipwrights Job Work has been made by the First Assistant to the Surveyor of the Navy, by whom the Propositions have afterwards been submitted to the Surveyors for their approval; and the only reason which, on his examination, he could urge for the great disparity of the prices which had been approved for the same description of work in the instance of the slates to the channels of the Canopus and Ton-

nant, was, "that very little notice had been "taken of stage work, as the officers of the "Yards were conceived to be the best "judges of the prices that ought to be allowed." It will appear likewise by his evidence, that the prices for stage work at the several Yards have been very different.&#x2014;It is stated, that the Prices proposed by the Officers of Plymouth Yard during the late war, for Job Work, and which were approved by the Navy Board, were in general high; and from the circumstance before stated of the exorbitant sum allowed for the stages to the channels of the Canopus, we were led to a more strict examination of that Proposition; when we found that no less a sum than 149l had been proposed for stage work to that ship while under Repair, and which had received the sanction of the Navy Board; as follows:&#x2014;

<p id="S1V0003P0-01778">On examining the Shipwright Officers as to the propriety of the charges for those works, they all stated them to be enormous; and the only officer belonging to the Yard, whose signature was affixed to that Proposition, has given it as his opinion, that for the second and fifth articles, taking it for granted the stages were fore and aft, that is, the whole length of the ship, they should each have been stated two stages, making together 4, instead of 8, at 2l. 7s. 6d. each; in the whole 9l. 10s. instead of 80l. For the fourth article, two stages should have been charged at 4l. each, in the whole 8l. instead of 60l. and in respect to the others, not being able to recollect the purposes for which they were erected, he could not form any opinion.&#x2014;In excuse for having signed this Preposition, so contrary to his ideas of propriety, he stated, that the prices proposed to be allowed for the different stages had been so frequently approved by the Board, as to have been considered as established; that he did not examine the Proposition in question previous to his signing it; and that such papers are seldom tendered to the Assistants for their signatures, until about the time of their being forwarded to the Navy Board.&#x2014;The sum of 5,623l. 0s. 9d. before stated to have been over-paid, to the Shipwrights in the Repairs of his Majesty's ships Princess Royal, San Josef, Orion, Hercule, Donegal, Spar-

tiate, and Canopus, is merely the difference between the value of the works performed, as approved by the Navy Board, and the wages actually paid to the men; but when the manner in which such valuation has been made and examined, is taken into consideration, it is impossible to say to what extent the abuse may have existed.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01779">Having now stated the principal circumstances which have come to our knowledge respecting the employment of the Shipwrights during the late war, we proceed to consider such as have occurred since that time.&#x2014;At the conclusion of the war, the Navy Board, by warrant, dated the 10th of Oct. 1801, directed that the artificers should be employed double days, as the daylight would not allow of their working the extra they had been accustomed to do in the summer months.&#x2014;On the 2d of Jan. 1802, a Scheme of Prices was first established by the Navy Board for various works performed by the Shipwrights by Job, after the system had been adopted 18 years, and acted upon generally for nearly ten; and the officers were authorized to allow the shipwrights for the particular works therein stated, the prices directed, without further authority from the Board; and to propose prices for such articles only as were not contained in the Schedule. The Navy Board, in their warrant, accompanying the Scheme, observe, that "they considered it to comprehend the "principal if not the whole of the articles "that are undertaken in the course of carrying on the Repairs of, or in fitting his "Majesty's ships;" but from the best information we have been able to collect, we have reason to believe that the Scheme is very imperfect, and does not contain one-tenth of the numerous articles of work which arise in the repairs of ships; and that the prices are very disproportionate, as, upon some articles the men can earn from 7 to 8s. a day, and upon others not more than 3s. 4d.&#x2014;Upon the receipt of the Warrant and Scheme of Prices, documents were made out by the Master Shipwright to the clerk of the Checque, stating the particulars of the work performed by the men contained in the schedule, and the price for each, as fixed by the Navy Board; and for such as did not come within the schedule, prices were proposed to the Board as formerly. The document to the clerk of the checque, which is called a "Job Note," was not sent to his office until the Navy Board had signified, their approval, or made the corrections they judged necessary in the part submitted to
<image src="S1V0003P0I0517"/>
<col>1005</col>
them, when the sum of the prices approved by the Board was entered at the bottom of the note, and the whole brought into one total, and signed by the Master Shipwright.&#x2014;In the Job notes to the clerk of the checque the names of the different quarter-men employed on the Jobs, were stated as a guide to the clerk of the checque in setting off the amount to their respective gangs; but the single stationed men employed in drawing and keeping the accounts of Job work, were continued to be reported as working at their tools, and the same fallacy obtained in the Propositions to the Navy Board, as before noticed, of slating such a number of men to have been employed on the Job, whose wages, calculated at the rate of double days, would amount to the sum of the Proposition, although containing only a part of the work performed.&#x2014;We are of opinion, that Job Notes or Documents, as before described, of the work performed, with the Prices approved by the Navy Board, and the persons actually employed, should have been given by the master shipwright to the clerk of the checque, from the first introduction of Job Work; and we think the conduct of the latter officer during the last war very unjustifiable in setting off the wages of the Shipwrights upon the loose voucher of the general Notes given by the master shipwright.&#x2014;What led to the introduction of Job Notes, upon the receipt of the warrant of the 2d of Jan. 1802, which is silent on the subject, we are at a loss to determine; but the reason which has been offered to us is, its having been understood, that however loosely the accounts of Job Work had been made up during the late war, due attention was to be paid in future that the amount of the works performed was equivalent to the wages set off to the men.&#x2014;On the breaking out of the present war, the Navy Board directed, by warrant dated the 12th of March 1803, that the Artificers were to work extra time, without limiting the extra to the ships which had been or might be ordered to be brought forward.&#x2014;Upon the receipt of this warrant, the Artificers were employed five hours extra beyond the common working hours; but there having been a recent change in the principal officers pf the Yard, they did not, according to their interpretation of the Navy Board's orders, conceive themselves justified in following the precedent set by their predecessors, of paying the Artificers for the extra time, without regard to the work they had performed, and in consequence stated
<col>1006</col>
to the Board on the 29th of March 1803, what had been the practice, and requested their directions on the subject&#x2014;In return to this letter, the Navy Board directed, by the warrant of the 4th of April 1803, that the workmen should be employed by Job in the extra time as well as in the common hours, and that they should be paid what they could earn.&#x2014;The Navy Board at the same time called on Mr. Seppings, the master shipwright at Chatham, who had been foreman and assistant of Plymouth Yard during the last war, to know whether such a custom as that stated by the Plymouth officers had prevailed, and desired Commissioner Fanshawe to examine the foremen, guartermen, and clerks, to the same point. Upon the receipt of their answers, the Navy Board wrote to the late master shipwright, clerk of the checque, and two of the assistants, to be informed of every circumstance which came within their recollection relative to the mode in which the earnings of the workmen had been computed when employed extra, beyond the two for one by Job in the common working hours; and upon the receipt of their answers the Navy Board, on the 29th of April, called upon the officers of Plymouth Yard, to let them know from whom they had obtained the information which induced them to write their letter of the 25th of March, as they had endeavoured, without effect, to ascertain when the custom of throwing the work performed in the extra hours into the Job Account had prevailed in Plymouth Yard; and they directed them to state particularly every circumstance which had come to their knowledge relative thereto, or that might tend to shew that the work in the extra hours had not been separated from that performed in the common hours, or that it had been measured therewith.&#x2014;In compliance with these directions, the officers, on the 3d of May, transmitted to the Board a Certificate, signed by all the quartermen belonging to the Yard, corresponding in substance exactly with the evidence given by the four quartermen whom we examined upon this subject, which has been before detailed; and the officers, in corroboration of their representation, made a comparative Statement of the Value of the Works which had been performed to his Majesty's ship Hercule, and the wages which had been paid to the shipwrights; by which Statement it appeared that an overpayment had been made to the men on that ship, to the amount of 1,454l. 13s. 3d as follows:

Mr. Bastard states, that the mode of employing the workmen was by Job in the common working hours, and that they were paid the extra for the time they stayed in the Yard: but neither of them admit that the work performed in the extra time was taken into the Job account.&#x2014;Upon these reports, which are so contradictory, and which in a great measure admit the fact, indeed as fully as could be expected from persons immediately implicated in the transactions, the Navy Board, without any further enquiry, formed their opinion that the Abuse had not existed; and thus the matter rested until it became the subject of our investigation, when we were, informed by the Comptroller that notwithstanding the time which had elapsed, it was still open to discussion, and would be again
<image src="S1V0003P0I0519"/>
<col>1009</col>
taken up by the Board.&#x2014;The Comptroller has stated, that in forming his opinion, that the Abuse represented by the Plymouth officers had not existed, he was influenced principally by the report of Mr. Seppings, which stated, that the men actually earned the wages they were allowed; but if the Board had merely referred to the Propositions for the San Josef, which he adduced as instances in support of his assertion, they would have seen that it was not founded in fact; as the Propositions for that ship stated that the men had been employed double days only, as was the case in every instance which came under our view; and as Mr. Seppings said, that <i>the whale of the work was included in the Job Account,</i> it followed, as the amount of each Proposition was only equal to the wages of the number of men stated to have been employed at the rate of double days, that the extra had been paid without any work having been performed for it.&#x2014;The Comptroller and the Senior Surveyor agree as to its having been the intention of the Board, when they have directed the artificers of the several Yards to be employed extra beyond the two for one in the common hours', that they should be employed in such extra time by Job, and not paid at the authorized rates of working, unless they perform work equal in value thereto, according to the Job prices; we cannot therefore help noticing an observation made by the Comptroller, that so long as the men received only the rate of pay which they were allowed under the orders of the Navy Board to earn, the public received no injury; whereas it must appear, that in every case where the work performed did not come up to the pay allowed, the public did receive an actual injury to the amount of the excess of the pay beyond the value of the work.&#x2014;The Senior Surveyor states, that they must necessarily be employed on the same work, and that it cannot be separated; but the Junior Surveyor has notwithstanding asserted, that the Navy Board have directed the artificers to be employed in the extra time both by Job and by Day work, though he could not point out any instance in which the latter directions had been given; and on being questioned as to the possibility of the quartermen separating the Work performed by Job in the common hours, from that done in the extra time, he stated, "that he conceives the Shipwrights "to have been employed upon other works "in some other parts of the ship in the extra time, or that when they may have been
<col>1010</col>
"continued on the same work, that a reduction has been made therefrom;" but when it be considered that the motive for employing the men extra is to expedite the fitting of the ships, and with that view it is necessary to employ the artificers at the same time on the different works, in order that they may all be completed as nearly together as possible, the inexpediency and improbability of reserving work in any particular part of a ship, to be performed in the extra time exclusively, must be seen; and had this practice obtained at Plymouth when the men were working a night extra, as the time for such extra was made up by their coming to work an hour earlier than usual in the morning, by their staying in the Yard during their dinner time, and remaining at work an hour and a half after bell-ringing in the evening, it would have been necessary for the Shipwrights to have removed from one work to another in different parts of the ship, and to have carried their took with them four times in each day.&#x2014;The Junior Surveyor having also stated, that the books of the Navy Office would point out the Board's intention with regard to employing the artificers of Plymouth Yard during the late war, by Job or Day Work in the extra time; we called upon the Board for such Extracts therefrom, as would clear up this point. In return we received a Copy of the Warrant dated 22d May 1797, directing, that the foremen and quartermen should have the same rate of extra as the working men, when they might be employed more than the common hours by Piece or Job, which, as we have before observed, certainly implies that it was the intention of the Board that the workmen should be employed by Job in the extra time. We also received a Copy of a Warrant dated 23d Jan. 1801,for employing the artificers one night extra, which does not clearly specify in what manner they were to be employed in such extra time; but, as it directs "that the rate of the "people's earnings should be set off in proportion to the quantities of work performed by them," we are induced to think that it was intended the artificers should be employed by Job.&#x2014;We have before stated it to be our opinion, that as the Navy Board intended the employment by Job should be an employment "bon&#x00E2; fide" by the piece, they were very inattentive to their duty and the public interest in having suffered the practice of paying the artificers, without regard to the value of the work performed, to have existed in Plymouth Yard for such a
<image src="S1V0003P0I0520"/>
<col>1011</col>
length of time; but when this subject was specifically brought before them, it then at least should have had a full and complete examination: it might have been considered, that if the joint representation of the quartermen, the very persons by whom the account of the work was taken, with that of the master shipwright, and other officers of the Yard, was to be discredited, and the letters of the late officers, who were themselves implicated in the transaction, relied upon in preference, there yet remained the circumstantial evidence of the Statement, shewing the excess of the sums paid to the workmen on the Repair of the Hercule over the value of the works performed, which does not appear to have been invalidated, or indeed examined, though so much turned upon it.&#x2014;In our judgment, the Representation of the Yard Officers was not shaken, but in a great measure confirmed by the enquiries which had been made. The Navy Board, however, were satisfied that no such Abuse had existed; it follows of course, that in their opinion, the Statement was a fabrication, and their own conduct and that of the late officers calumniated; the officers, as being the actors in this waste of the public money, and the Navy Board as neglecting to notice the Abuse. The Board seemed therefore called upon to pass a severe censure upon the persons who from ignorance, or worse motives, had brought forward so heavy a charge; for the public has an interest not only in punishing delinquents, but in rescuing from obloquy the characters of their servants, when unjustly traduced.&#x2014;Should it be said, that whatever Abuse had been committed, the discovery came too late; that the officers under whose management it had prevailed, were already dismissed or removed, and the system had been changed, and therefore it was useless to pursue the matter further:&#x2014;the answer is, that the enquiry was at this rate entered into, without any practical purpose to be served by it, for all these reasons against the enquiry existed before it took place: neither have we cause to imagine any such reasons did influence the Navy Board to abandon the enquiry; the reason assigned was, their opinion that no such Abuse bad existed. We shall dilate no further upon this subject: we think the manner in which it was passed over very improper; and it will be seen in various parts of this Report, that the Statement made by the present officers was founded in truth.&#x2014;During the visitation of the Dock Yards by the Admiralty and Navy Boards, in the year
<col>1012</col>
1802, several of the Abuses which had been practised in the Employment and Payment of the workmen by Job, were discovered; and their lordships had frequent occasion to express to the Navy Board their dissatisfaction at the existence of such Abuses, and their entire disapprobation of the system of Job Work.&#x2014;In Nov. 1802, the Navy Board proposed to the Admiralty the number of workmen which they judged proper to be employed in the different Yards during the peace, and observed, that in the Copy of the Minutes of the Board of Admiralty, dated the 16th of Oct. preceding, their lordships disapproved of the principle of Job Work, and condemned the system altogether; and therefore requested to know if it was their intention to have it discontinued, and, in that case, to be furnished with their directions in respect to any other mode they might be pleased to adopt for employing the artificers on Repairs. The Navy Board, however, deemed it their duty to observe, that they knew of no Mode better calculated for the Advantage of the Public, than that hitherto practised, provided the Abuses which had been brought to Light on the Visitation, and every other which could be discovered, were corrected, and guarded against in future, and the prices allowed for every Job reconsidered and adjusted, especially, as by the apprentices having been taken from the officers, they conceived the temptations for Abuse were in a great measure done away; but they feared if the workmen were allowed to go back to day work, the public would not experience that benefit and exertion from their labour which might be derived from Job Work under proper regulations.&#x2014;The Admiralty, in reply to that Proposal, said, they concluded that the system of Job Work, after what had appeared, would not have been recommended by the Navy Board without a due consideration of all the circumstances, and that care would be taken by them for correcting and guarding against Abuses in future, as also for adjusting the prices proper to be allowed for each Job; they therefore consented to the Navy Board's authorizing the officers of the Dock Yards to continue to employ the shipwrights and other artificers in the manner they had proposed, considering them responsible for the execution of the plan in the manner most advantageous to the public; and their lordships directed they should lose no time in apprizing them of the prices they might fix upon for such work, and of the nature of the checks intended to be established
<image src="S1V0003P0I0521"/>
<col>1013</col>
for preventing impositions in future.&#x2014;The Navy Board, in their Proposal, fully acknowledge that Abuses existed, that Regulations were necessary to guard against them in future, and that the prices required consideration and adjustment; and the Surveyors state in their evidence, that the prices allowed for Job Work will admit of reduction; yet, on the 4th of April 1803, without any alteration having been made in the prices, or any regulations adopted for preventing the Abuses which had been discovered, the Navy Board withdrew the restriction that had hitherto been imposed on the men's earnings. This measure appears to have been inconsiderate, as the prices by which the men were to be paid are acknowledged to be too high, and as it gave greater scope for Abuse, by the increased inducement it held forth to the inferior officers to augment improperly the wages of the workmen, in order to add to their own; and then Senior Surveyor has acknowledged, that at present there are no checks to prevent their doing so, but that the Board are endeavouring to establish some checks upon the Accounts of the work rendered by the quartermen.&#x2014;As this measure appeared to us extraordinary, especially after what had so recently passed between the two Boards on the subject of Job Work, we called upon the Navy Board to know the reasons which induced them to depart from the practice of restricting the earnings of the men by Job to certain rates, and whether it was done by authority from the Board of Admiralty. In answer to our Requisition, they transmitted us a Correspondence which had passed between the Boards, at the breaking out of the present war, on the subject of employing the men extra. The first Order given by the Admiralty to the Navy Board on the 10th March 1803, was to employ the artificers in the respective Dock Yards as much extra as possible, in order to get the ships ready which were fitting for sea, without a moment's loss of time; the Navy Board, upon that order, requested to be informed whether the artificers were to be employed extra time to bring forward the ships wanting repair as soon as possible, or if the extra was to be confined to the men employed upon the ships already ordered, or which might be ordered to be fitted for service; and the Admiralty, on the 12th March 1803, directed "the Artificers to work extra time, "without limiting the extra to the ships "only which are or may be ordered to be "brought forward." The warrant given
<col>1014</col>
by the Navy Board directed the officers to employ the artificers as much extra as possible; in consequence of which, the officers desired to know whether the workmen were to be employed by Job in the extra time, as well as the common hours, and paid according to their earnings, or whether they were to be paid as they formerly had been, two for one by Job in the common working hours, and at the established rates for such extra time as they remained at work. The Navy Board, in reply, directed the workmen to be employed wholly by Job, and that they should be paid according to their earnings: we are of opinion, that this measure was impolitic, considering the circumstances under which it was carried into effect, and that the restriction on the amount of the men's earnings should have been continued until the prices considered to be too high had been fixed at equitable rates, and proper checks established on the accounts of the work performed.&#x2014;The following Statement affords a comparative view of the wages paid per day, on an average, to the Shipwrights of the different Yards in Christmas Quarter 1803, under the orders to pay them according to their earnings, without any restriction.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01783">By the above Statement, it appears, that the average wages of the Shipwrights employed by Job have differed very materially, although the time of working has been the same in all the Yards except Portsmouth and Plymouth, where, in addition to the common hours of labour, they have been employed during the time allowed for dinner; and although the Shipwrights of those Yards have been employed more time, yet it appears they have in the former been paid; 1s. 4&#x00BC;d. and in the latter 1s. 3&#x00BD;9;d. a day less than those of Chatham Yard; and at Sheerness, although the hours of working have been the same as at Chatham, they have been paid 2s. 5&#x00E9;d. a day less. The difference in the earnings of the Shipwrights employed by task in Portsmouth and Plymouth Yards, where they have worked the same time, is equally extraordinary.&#x2014;The great inequality in the amount of the wages of the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0522"/>
<col>1015</col>
Shipwrights employed by Job can only be accounted for by supposing, that different prices have been allowed, or that more correct accounts have been taken of the work performed at some Yards than at others. As the same inducement, by paying the workmen according to their earnings, has been held forth at all the Yards, it is reasonable to conclude that it has been productive of equal exertion.&#x2014;Various measures have been adopted by the present officers of Plymouth Yard, in order that the accounts of Job work should be rendered with as much accuracy, and the men paid as justly, both to themselves and the public, as the complicated nature of the business will allow; but although much has been done to correct the system, the employment of the Shipwrights by Job is still subject to many objections; the payments to the men continue to be made upon the faith of the accounts rendered by the quartermen, who are still paid, as well as the persons employed in writing the Job accounts, in proportion to the earnings of the working men. And although the master shipwright has required to each account a certificate of the actual performance of the work from the assistant and foreman under whose immediate inspection it was carried on, previous to his signing the account, vet we find that those officers have signed such certificates without giving the accounts any more effectual examination than formerly; in excuse for which they have stated, that the various duties required of them would not admit of their doing so.&#x2014;The number of persons employed in writing the Job accounts in Plymouth Yard is no less than ten, who are mostly shipwrights and reduced quartermen; and the expence of their wages, it is estimated, will amount to upwards of 1000l. annually.&#x2014;The accounts are so complicated and voluminous, that, notwithstanding the men are always one quarter's wages in arrear, it has been found impossible to collect the accounts, procure the approbation of the Navy Board to the prices for the articles not contained in the schedule, and to make out the Job notes to the clerk of the checque in time for him to set off the wages, and cast the pay books, by the usual period for payment: in consequence of which, the payment has been so long delayed as to become a serious inconvenience to the workmen; the wages for Midsummer quarter last were not paid until the 31st Oct. following, and for Michaelmas quarter not until 25th Feb. 1804.&#x2014;So many evils having come to our knowledge from the gene-
<col>1016</col>
ral adoption of the system of employing the artificers by Job, we judged it necessary to call upon the Navy Board by letter, for a communication of the reasons which induced them to employ the artificers by Job, in preference to Day work; and for copies of any accounts or calculations which might have been made, to prove the advantage of employing them by Job, or to contrast the amount of the wages or earnings set off to the shipwrights, with the value of the work actually performed.&#x2014;In their answer, they assign only general reasons; but state, "that "by the correspondence in office, it appears, "that the officers of the several Dock Yards "were consulted as to the practicability of "affixing a proper (and their opinion what) "price for any Job of work to be performed "in the repair of ships, according to the "time required to perform it in: schemes "and prices were accordingly received from "the several Yards, and the same being maturely considered by the Board, were "either adopted or altered, as the judgment "of the Board warranted. After the "schemes, thus corrected, were referred to "the officers of some of the Yards, the system of Job work was ordered to be established." But it having appeared, in the course of our examination at Plymouth, that no schedule of prices to be allowed for Job work had been transmitted to the officers of that Yard till Jan. 1802, after the plan had been generally acted upon more than ten years, we examined the Comptroller and Surveyors of the Navy, and their Assistant, and found that the extract from the letter above quoted was incorrect, and that no scheme of prices had been fixed till the period before-mentioned.</p>

<title>MASTMAKERS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01784">The persons employed as Mastmakers are shipwrights, with the same rates of pay and allowances as those working at the dock side: there are in general three companies or gangs, which are considered as belonging to the masthouse, each usually consisting of twenty persons, a quarterman, fourteen men, and five apprentices. These companies are selected annually by the master shipwright, previous to the general shoaling of the shipwrights, and are usually composed of old and infirm men, as the work in the masthouse is lighter than that at the dock side, and requires more skill than strength to perform it. When the persons stationed at the masthouse are found to be insufficient to
<image src="S1V0003P0I0523"/>
<col>1017</col>
perform the works required, the master shipwright directs additional companies to be employed there, in general the task companies; which are, when working at the masthouse, directed by the Navy Board to be employed by task.&#x2014;The mastmakers were employed by the day, working such occasional extra as the service required, until Sept. 1790; when the Navy Board, by their warrant of the 27th of that month, established certain prices for making masts and yards, and directed the officers to employ the men on that service by task, and to pay them accordingly.&#x2014;On the 31st of Jan. 1791, the Navy Board established prices for the performance of certain works on masts and yards, and directed the officers to allow the artificers those prices when they should receive orders to perform such works by Job.&#x2014;On the 12th of Oct. 1793, the Navy Board transmitted a scheme of works for the employment of the mastmakers by Job, with prices to be allowed for the same, and directed the officers to employ them by Job, and pay them agreeably to such prices.&#x2014;On the 18th Dec. 1795, the Navy Board transmitted a scheme of sundry works concerning masts, and directed the officers to cause them to be performed by Job, and paid for accordingly.&#x2014;The Navy Board, having taken the opinions of the officers of the several Yards, as to the prices proper to be allowed for making masts and yards, and having considered the same, they, by warrant of the 20th Feb. 1799, rescinded the prices of 1790, and established a scheme of prices considerably lower.&#x2014;This reduction in the prices is stated to us to have been made in consequence of its having been discovered at one of the Yards, that a part of the work was done by the sawyers; as a part of the work must necessarily be performed by the sawyers, it may seem extraordinary that the proportion was not directed by the Navy Board at the time of establishing the first scheme of task in 1790, and the prices then regulated according to that proportion.&#x2014;There is an inaccuracy in the present scheme of task, as a less price appears to be allowed for making masts for sloops in parts, than from single sticks; whereas, in most of the other classes of ships, there is double the sum allowed for making masts in parts that there is for making them from single sticks. We point this out to shew the necessity of more attention being paid to the warrants establishing prices of works.&#x2014;The Mastmakers appear to have been employed by task in making masts and yards during the
<col>1018</col>
late war, and to have been paid, according to their earnings, by notes from the master shipwright to the clerk of the checque, detailing the works performed, with the prices established for the same. But notwithstanding the warrants before detailed for employing them by job, and notwithstanding the general warrant of the 7th Oct. 1794, which expressly directed, that such of the shipwrights employed in the masthouse as were not capable of working by task or job, should be employed two tides extra by day work, yet it appears that no account was taken of the works performed by those directed to be employed by job but that they were all, except those on task, the able and infirm, without any distinction, paid alike; at the rate of two for one for working in the common hours, and at the established rate for the extra time they remained in the Yard, by notes from the master shipwright to the clerk of the checque, stating that they were to be employed upon the masts and yards of ships filling at the rate of double days by job, and one or two tides, or one night extra, according as the other shipwrights might be working; in total disregard to the several warrants of the Navy Board, which directed, that the officers should propose such jobs as they might think it right the men should be employed upon, with the prices to be allowed for the same, either prior to their being taken in hand, or at the end of every month, for their approval and orders thereon. We cannot here help expressing our surprise, that the Navy Board, having very properly directed the mode of employing and paying the old and infirm men, of which the companies belonging to the mast, boat, top, and capstan houses, are generally-composed, should themselves, as well as the officers of the Yard, have totally lost sight of it.&#x2014;Although it has been stated to us by the Navy Board, that the employment by job was intended to be an employment bona fide by the piece, for which the men were to be paid at certain prices for the works actually performed; and although the Mastmakers were paid as if employed by job all the late war, yet it appears that no account was taken-of the works performed by them until the 22d May 1802, after the dismissal of the late master shipwright and the appointment of the present, by whom the master mastmaker was directed to render an account of the works that had Been performed by job, from the 1st of April preceding, which he now does monthly, affixing the prices as directed by the Navy Board to about one half of the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0524"/>
<col>1019</col>
work; and for the other half, for which no prices are established, he proposes prices for the master shipwright's approbation. Since the 12th March 1803, the Mastmakers employed by job, as well as by task, have been paid according to their earnings, by notes from the master shipwright to the clerk of the checque.&#x2014;It has been slated to us, that the business of mastmaking requires considerable skill and minute attention in putting the parts of made masts together, differing in its nature from the general work of the shipwrights; it therefore occurred to us, that at might be advantageous to bring up a certain number of the apprentices exclusively to the business of mastmaking; and, in that opinion, the master mastmaker fully concurs: we do not mean such a number as to exclude the old and infirm shipwrights from working in the masthouse, but as many as may be necessary to enable the Navy Board to select from amongst them proper persons for directing and superintending the work; by whose experience improvements may be made in mastmaking, hardly to be expected from men not employed in it until an advanced lime of life.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>TOP AND CAPSTAN HOUSE.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01785">There is one company of shipwrights, consisting of a quarterman, and generally of 15 men, and 4 apprentices, selected annually by the master shipwright from amongst the old and infirm men, before the general shoaling of the shipwrights takes place, to be employed in making and repairing tops and capstans, in fitting pumps, and stocking anchors, and on other trifling services.&#x2014;The Navy Board, by their warrant of the 27th of April 1795, established prices for making and repairing capstans, and for stocking anchors, and directed the officers to employ the workmen on such services by job, and to pay them agreeably to such prices; and on the 16th of May following, they established prices for making and repairing tops, and for sundry other trifling articles; and directed the officers to employ and pay the workmen accordingly.&#x2014;The shipwrights employed in the top and capstan house have been paid the same as those working at the dock side; that is, at the rate of 2 for 1 for the common hours, and at the established rate for the extra time; and their wages do not appear to have been affected by the prices established by the Navy Board for task and job work until the 12th of March 1803, when the artificers were directed to
<col>1020</col>
be employed unlimited extra, and to be paid according to their earnings by task or job.</p>

<section>
<title>BOATBUILDERS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01786">The Boatbuilders, like the mastmakers, and for the same reason, are selected by the master shipwright from amongst the old and infirm shipwrights, before the general annual shoaling of the shipwrights into companies; or gangs takes place; there are usually two or three companies so selected, each consisting of a quarterman, and generally of 14 men and 5 servants, that are considered as belonging to the boathouse; and when they are found to be insufficient to perform the work, the master shipwright directs such other companies to be employed in the boathouse as he may judge proper.&#x2014;The shipwrights employed at the boathouse have the same established rates of pay and allowances as those working at the dock side; and they are in general employed the same e*tra.&#x2014;.It appears, the shipwrights employed in the boathouse worked by the day until Nov. 1794, when the Navy Board, by their warrant of the 7th of that month, established certain prices per foot for building and completing launches, barges, and pinnaces by task, and directed the officers to employ the men accordingly.&#x2014;And, on the 13th of March 1795, the Navy Board directed the officers to employ the shipwrights by job in the repairs of boats in the common working hours of the Yard, and to allow them the prices then established, being so much per foot for a large, middling, and small repair; the officers taking care to estimate the nature of the repairs, so that the workmen should be paid in proportion to their exertion, and that the public service should be thereby benefited. Upon the receipt of this warrant, or soon after it, the then master shipwright subdivided the prices, in order to pay the men more equitably, according to the quantum of repairs the boats might stand in need of; and the present master shipwright, some months after his appointment, wrote to the Navy Board, and submitted the prices so subdivided to their consideration, wishing, we conclude, to have their sanction for what appeared not to be directly authorized by the said warrant; but his letter was not thought to be of sufficient consequence to deserve an answer. We must here differ in opinion with the Navy Board, as their warrant established certain fixed prices, from which we have been told by one of the Surveyors of the Navy, the officers ought
<image src="S1V0003P0I0525"/>

not to have departed, without representing the same to the Navy Board.&#x2014;It appears, that, previously to directing the boats to be repaired by job, a correspondence took place between the Navy Board, the Surveyors of the Navy, and the Officers of Portsmouth Yard, on that subject.&#x2014;The officers of that Yard, in their letter to the Navy Board of the 30th of Oct. 1793, expressly say, "We "are decidedly of opinion, that no mode of "job work can be proposed on the repairs "of old boats that would enable the people "to earn more than one tide in the winter, "and two tides in the summer months, between the hours of bell-ringing." We apprehend the one and two tides are meant in addition to their usual pay for working in the common hours.&#x2014;The Navy Board, by their warrant of the 9th Feb. 1795, directed the officers to employ by job such of the day companies of shipwrights as it might be necessary to send into the houses, (that is, the boat, mast, top and capstan houses) so as to make their earnings equal to what they would have been if employed on the repairs of ships at the dock side. It is necessary to observe, the shipwrights working at the dock side were then employed at the rate of 2 for 1.&#x2014;The officers, in their reply of the 13th Feb. stated it to be impracticable to form job accounts of many services performed in the houses, as set forth in their letter of the 30th Oct. 1793, and therefore desired to know, whether the accounts of such jobs were to be dispensed with; and whether the shipwrights, when employed in the houses, were, from their using their utmost exertions, to be indulged with the same rate of earnings as those working at the dock side.&#x2014;The Navy Board, in their answer of the 19th, confirm their order of the 9th; and again direct the officers to employ, by job, the shipwrights sent into the houses, so as to make their earnings equal to what they would have been if employod at the dock side; and in order to their doing so, they were directed to reconsider their letter of the 30th Oct. 1793, and to propose such works as could be performed by job; and, in cases where it was not practicable to reduce the work into a job, the officers were to take care that the workmen exerted themselves so as to merit the indulgence of the job earnings.&#x2014;The Surveyors of the Navy, in their letter of the following day to the officers, inclosed a scheme for repairing the several classes of boats, and desired them to consider what prices were proper to be allowed, and to fill up the columns of value, or
<col>1022</col>
total amount, for the different degrees of repair, and then to propose the same to the Navy Board for their approbation.&#x2014;It also appears that similar letters were written by the surveyors to the officers of all the other Yards, except Plymouth; but how the scheme transmitted with the said letters was to be understood it is difficult to conceive; it consisted of 11 articles, 2 of which were for a small repair of a cutter of 18 feet in length, 2 for a small, and 3 for a middling repair of a cutter of 24 feet.&#x2014;The officers of Portsmouth Yard, in their reply of the 23d of Feb. state, that having again maturely considered the proposed scheme for repairing boats by job, they were still of opinion it was impossible to make jobs for repairing boats without fallacy and subterfuge; that, owing to the shipwrights employed at the dock side not having proper took, and to their not being accustomed to such light work, it would be impossible for them to earn more than bare day's pay; and that there was no other mode of making their earnings equal to the earnings of the shipwrights employed at the dock side, but by allowing them, when the boats only wanted a very small repair, the price proposed for a large repair.&#x2014;It must appear very extraordinary that, immediately after this correspondence, the Navy Board should have directed the repairs of boats in all the Yards to take the fallacious appearance of job work, and thereby render it necessary for the officers to make out accounts, not of the works as actually performed, but such as would give to the workmen employed in the boathouse the same rate of wages as the shipwrights employed at the dock side. We were naturally led to enquire of the surveyors of the Navy what reasons, under such circumstances, could have induced the Navy Board to direct the boats to be repaired by job, and were told it must have been done in consequence of a proposal from the officers of some of the other Yards.&#x2014;If, by such proposal, was meant a recommendation entirely originating with the officers themselves, we think it improbable that any such proposal was made. At Portsmouth, we have shewn, that a remonstrance, couched in very strong language, was made against the plan altogether; and we cannot but disapprove of the surveyors, or any 2 members of the Navy Board giving directions to the officers of the Yard, as 3 members are necessary to constitute a Board&#x2014;Notwithstanding it was so stongly urged by the Portsmouth officers, that no
<image src="S1V0003P0I0526"/>
<col>1023</col>
scheme of job work could be formed for the shipwrights employed in the boat-house, by which they could make the same earnings as those at the dock side, yet it appears, that in Michaelmas quarter 1803, the average wages paid to the shipwrights employed by job in the boathouse was 6s. 5d.; and to those at the dock side only 5s. 5&#x00BC;d. a day.&#x2014;If the shipwrights in the boathouse at Plymouth have been supposed to work by task or job, it certainly has not been a bona fide employment by the piece; those working by task, as well as those by job, were restricted in their earnings to 2 for 1 for working in the common hours; and those working by task, are said to have been so employed in the common hours, and by day-work in the extra time; but it, has virtually been the same, as the whole have been paid at the rate of 2 for one for the common hours, and at the established rate for any additional extra they may have worked, the same as the most efficient shipwrights working at the dock side; although the Navy Board, by their Warrant of the 7th Oct. 1794, directed that the shipwrights employed in the boathouse not capable of working by task or job, should be employed only two tides extra by day work.&#x2014;Very regular accounts have been kept of the whole of the works performed in the boathouse, both in the common working hours I and in the extra time, but without distinguishing the one from the other. At the end of each month, previously to making out the job notes, it has been usual to calculate the. value of all the work performed, and the amount of the wages of the men employed, at the rate of 2 for 1; and whenever there has been an excess of work above 2 for 1, it has been omitted in the month in which it was performed, and carried forward to the succeeding months, in which the earnings might have fallen short of that rate of pay.&#x2014;It appears, the shipwrights employed in the boathouse during the late war, like those working at the dock side, have been in general considered to be employed by job in the common working] hours, and by day-work in the extra time; and that the work performed by them has been taken account of, and entered in the job notes delivered regularly by the master boatbuilder to the master shipwright, to make up the amount of the earnings of the men to 2 for 1.&#x2014;The shipwrights working in the boathouse by task or job, during the late war, were paid by notes from the master shipwright to the clerk of the checque,
<col>1024</col>
and certificates that the value of the work performed by them, estimated according to the prices established by the Navy Board, was equal to 2 for 1; these certificates only applied to the double day's pay for working in the common hours, as they were paid for the extra time they remained in the Yard, under the authority of the master shipwright's general notes to the clerk of the checque, stating the rate of extra at which the artificers were to be employed until further order.&#x2014;It having been stated to us, that the earnings of the shipwrights employed in the boathouse, generally fell short of 2 for 1 in the winter months, and, when they were employed a night extra, or at the rate of 3 for 1, that the value of the work performed by them did not much exceed double days pay, we caused the master boatbuilder to lay before us an account of the value of the works performed by job by the shipwrights employed in the boathouse, and of the amount of their wages calculated at the rate of 2 for 1, from the first introduction of job work in April 1795 to the 31st of Dec. 1802; and observing that the amount of the former was 44,749l. 6s. and of the latter 44,483l. 12s. 3d. by which there appeared to be an excess of 269l. 13s. 9d. in the value of the work above the wages paid for working in the common hours, and conceiving that such sum could form but a small part of the amount of the wages paid to the men for working in the extra time, in the course of near 8 years, we called upon the clerk of the checque for an account of the wages actually paid to the shipwrights employed in the boathouse, not on taskwork, in each year, from 1795 to 1802 both inclusive, omitting the wages of such persons as had not worked at their tools, in order to ascertain the amount of the wages paid, and compare it with the value of the work performed. In consequence of which, the clerk of the cheque laid before us an account, making the total of the wages paid in those years amount to 38,110l. 14s. 5d.; although the account was stated to contain the amount of the wages actually paid in those years, we discovered, upon examining the clerk who was employed to make it out, that no regular account had been kept of the companies of shipwrights occasionally employed in the boathouse, and that no part of the wages of the workmen for the extra time was included, by which the sum stated fell very considerably short of the amount of the wages actually paid, consequently no use
<image src="S1V0003P0I0527"/>
<col>1025</col>
could be made of the account: and, for the reasons before stated, we declined calling for another.&#x2014;The amount of the wages of the shipwrights employed by job in the boathouse in 1801, calculated at the rate of 2 for 1, was 5,8S5l. 15s. 10d. and the value of the works performed by them in that year was 5,971l. 8s. 5d. by which it appears the value of the works exceeded the wages paid for working in the common hours by 85l. 12s. 7d.; but as the men were paid at the rate of double days during the whole year, and 2 tides extra from the 1st to the 29th of Jan. and from the 30th Jan. to the 10th of Oct. 1 night extra, it ap-</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01788">We do not apprehend the wages paid exceeded the value of the work performed in an equal degree in any other year, as in those we have stated, as the workmen were not employed so much extra; but it will be seen by reference to the monthly account of the value of the works performed, and of the amount of the wages of the men employed, calculated at the rate of 2 for 1, that the wages so calculated in many months, and in some years, exceeded the value of the work performed; and we can see no reason to doubt the accuracy of that account, as it was drawn out at the end of each month by the foreman, or persons acting under him, when the circumstances were fresh in the memory; and when the number of persons actually employed in the boathouse by job must have been known&#x2014;It is now the practice, when a number of boats have had very trifling repairs, to charge the whole as a small repair upon 1; this is inconsistent with the Navy Board's Warrant, which appears to fix certain prices for a great, middling, and small repair, for each class of boat; and although the officers of most of the Yards have varied from those prices, according to their own discretion, yet we do not think such discretion is so clearly implied by the Warrant as it ought to have been. Where discretion is</p>
<col>1026</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01789">pears to us that me wages paid for wording beyond the usual hours must have been about 2,188l. 4s. 4d.; by which we conceive the wages actually paid the shipwrights employed by job in the boathouse in 1801, exceeded the value of the works performed by 2,102l. 11s. 9d. being about one-fourth of the wages paid.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01790">The following statement will shew that there were similar excesses in 1799 and 1800, during which years the shipwrights were employed at the rate of 2 for 1 for working in the common hours, and 2 tides extra.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01791">intended to be given to the officers of the Yards, we are of opinion, it should be clearly expressed.&#x2014;We do not mean, under any circumstances, to palliate inattention or disobedience of the officers of the Yards to the orders which they receive, but we cannot but attribute much of the confusion and irregularity in the mode of employing and paying the men to the want of system in the Navy Board, and the negligent manner in which their warrants have been drawn up.&#x2014;Since the 12th of March 1803, when the artificers were directed to be employed unlimited extra, and to be paid according to their actual earnings, it appears to have been the practice previous to making out the job notes, to calculate the amount of the wages of the shipwrights employed in the boat-house by job at the rate of 5s. 9d. or 5s. 10d. a day, and then to have reference to the job book, to see whether the amount of the prices allowed for the repairs of the boats completed and surveyed by the master shipwright was equal thereto, and if so, to make out the job notes accordingly; the job notes, we were told, have been so made out in order to prevent dissatisfaction amongst the workmen, from their earnings appearing to be greater in some months than in others; the motive may not be an improper one; but if the employment by
<image src="S1V0003P0I0528"/>
<col>1027</col>
job is now to be an employment bon&#x00E2; fide by the piece, we think there should be no reservation or falsification in the accounts, but that they should contain the whole work performed in the time stated, be it little or be it much.&#x2014;In the course of our enquiry respecting the shipwrights employed in the boathouse, we learned that Thomas White, the foreman during the late war, was incapable from old age of performing the duty of his situation, (which in consequence devolved on one of the quartermen); that he was employed on such trifling services as he was competent to perform, and attended in the Yard during the common working hours only; notwithstanding, on referring to the pay books, we found that he had been set off very high wages, and extra, to the same extent as the working men. This abuse has by no means been confined to the single instance above mentioned, owing to the very loose manner in which the documents for extra have been furnished. Another very strong instance of this nature occurred in the case of John Bonallack, a shipwright, who was superintendent of the teams of horses; this man was very far advanced in life, and nearly blind, in consequence of which, it appears by the evidence of Joseph Dawe, a shipwright, that he was appointed and did act for John Bonallack, from about Jan. to Sept. 1799, and from about Sept. 1800 to Oct. 1801, during which periods John Bonallack was prevented by sickness from attending his duty in the yard. On reference to the pay books, this man not only appeared to have been allowed the general extra of the Yard, but much occasional extra for attending the teams in the night in pumping the Docks.&#x2014;Having observed that some of the superior officers in the other Yards were filled by men incapable of performing the duties required of them, we think it our duty to notice and express our opinion, that it must he in vain to expect much order, regularity, or exertion, from great bodies of men, if the officers placed over them are from age and infirmities incapable of performing their several functions; we are therefore of opinion, that the Commissioners of the several Yards should from time to time point out to the Navy Board such officers as they may conceive ought to be superannuated or removed from their situations; and we think the attention of the Navy Board ought to be directed to those objects at the time of their visiting the different Yards, We are
<col>1028</col>
also of opinion, that the workmen of the several Yards should be mustered annually previous to the general shoaling of the shipwrights and caulkers, in the presence of the commissioner and all the officers, and that the masters and foremen in the several branches should point out to the commissioner such of the men as ought to be placed on the list for superannuation; these men at present only receive single days pay, and in case it should be thought right by the legislature to establish an adequate rate of pay for the different classes of artificers, instead of employing them by job, we think regard ought to be had thereto; and that some easy employment in the different branches should be allotted to the old and infirm men, until they may be eventually superannuated.&#x2014;It will not be necessary that any time usually appropriated to work, should be lost in making the musters we have recommended, as the men, with a view to the particular object, may probably be seen to most advantage at the usual limes of mustering in their working dresses.&#x2014;Having on our return to town seen the Copy of a Warrant for building boats in Portsmouth Yard, we discovered that the prices allowed for building boats in that Yard were not the same as those allowed in Plymouth Yard; we therefore called upon the officers of the several Yards for Copies of the Navy Board's Warrants, and prices established, for building boats by task; and although it has been stated to us by the comptroller and surveyors of his majesty's Navy, it was the intention of the Navy Board that the same prices should be allowed for performing similar works in the different yards, we, to our great surprize, found, that the prices allowed for building boats in the several Yards were different, even in those of Deptford and Woolwich, under the immediate superintendence of the surveyors of the Navy; and not only that the prices were essentially different, but that they were established on different principles.&#x2014;By the Navy Board's warrant of the 11th of May 1785, to the officers of Portsmouth Yard, the prices directed to be allowed for building several classes of boats are <i>increased</i> as the lengths of the boats are diminished; and by the warrant of the following day to the officers of Chatham Yard, the prices are <i>decreased</i> as the lengths of the boats are diminished; and the prices then established in Chatham Yard for building some classes of boats were 44 per cent. higher than those established
<image src="S1V0003P0I0529"/>
<col>1029</col>
for building similar boats in Portsmouth Yard, on the preceding day. We desired to be informed, in our examination of different members of the Navy Board, how such extraordinary circumstances were to be accounted for; the difference in the prices, we were told, was a circumstance unknown to them, and they knew of no reason why they should be so.&#x2014;Observing in the warrant of the 20th of Sept 1735 to the officers of Woolwich Yard, and in that of the 21st of Oct. 1735 to the officers of Deptford Yard, that they were directed to cause the boats to be built by job instead of task, as it would be for the advantage of the service, and not comprehending what was meant by the distinction, as certain prices per foot were directed to be allowed, the same as if they were to be built by task, we called upon two of the members of the Navy Board whose signatures were affixed to the former warrant, as well as some other members of the Board, to inform us what was intended by directing the boats to be built by job; and were told, they could not inform us.&#x2014;We feel it to be impossible to account for the circumstances before stated, but by supposing the secretary of the Navy Board, and his clerks, are employed to draw up warrants upon subjects they do not comprehend (which is admitted to be sometimes the case) and that the warrants are signed by the members without noticing their contents. As we shall in the course of this Report have to notice many inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the warrants of the Navy Board, directing the mode of employing and paying the workmen, we feel it to be our duly to recommend, that such warrants be not given upon every application or proposal from the officers of the Yards, without reference to the orders that have been before given on the subject, which appears to us to have been very generally the case; but that in future there be certain days in the year, or quarter, if necessary, for considering the orders to be given respecting the modes of employing and paying the workmen for their labour. And as some of the warrants are said not to have been made out in conformity with the Board's intention, and others are not understood by the members who signed them; and as it has been stated to us, that it is impossible all the members who sign the warrants can have time to read them, we recommend (as we understand the warrants are in general drawn up from minutes made by direction of the Board) that the
<col>1030</col>
member first signing them be held responsible for their contents being in conformity to the intention of the Board; and, as far as circumstances will admit, that each member shall sign the warrant that may have relation to the particular branch of the office placed under his immediate superintendence.</p>

<title>CAULKERS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01792">The Caulkers present rate of daily pay, including allowances, is 2s. 5&#x00BD;d.; they are also allowed for working on Sundays, and for sleeping on board his Majesty's ships, an extra day's pay, so that when employed on Sundays, it is by no means unusual for them to receive 5 days pay, or 10s. 5d. for one day's work, and sometimes more, besides a ration of provisions, the same as is allowed to the seamen of the Fleet.&#x2014;The Caulkers are classed, or shoaled annually into gangs or companies, the same as the shipwrights; but the mode of employing them differs from that of the other artificers. Instead of certain prices being fixed for the works to be done by them, certain portions of work are established, which they are to perform, to entitle them to the single day's pay, single day's pay and one tide, two tides; and, in caulking new ships bottoms, the portion of work is fixed for the double day; being less for the second day's pay than the first, in the proportion of 10 to 13. We endeavoured to learn from the comptroller and surveyors of the Navy, why less work should be performed for the second day's pay than the first, but without obtaining satisfactory information; being told, that it had proceeded from custom, and that it was conceived a man could not, after performing a hard day's work, do as much for the second and third day's pay as for the first; but we apprehend such reasoning will not at all apply, as it has been stated to us, that the Caulkers, when employed by Task, can perform as much work as will entitle them to three day's pay, or 6s. 3d. in less time than the common working hours of the Yard. The Navy Board's warrant of the 6th of May 1778, speaks of the Caulkers work having been very badly executed, particularly in Chatham Yard, and fixes the quantities of work to be performed in caulking ships bottoms for a single day's pay, single day and one tide, two tides, and for a double day's pay; but we can discover no general principle or rule by which the quantities of work directed to be performed have been calculated: for instance, the quantity of work in caulk-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0530"/>
<col>1031</col>
ing three-inch plank directed to be done for three tides, or in 4&#x00BD; hours, is 22&#x00BD; feet, and in the extra day or night, which is 5 hours, the quantity of work is 25 feet, so that for the additional half hour, 2&#x00BD; feet of seam is to be caulked; but in caulking two-inch plank, the quantity of work is the same for the extra day or night as for three tides, 30 feet instead of 33 feet and a third; so that the men when employed a night extra, although they do only the same work as is required to be done for three tides, receive two-pence halfpenny a day more. We should not have been induced to make this remark, but from the general inaccuracy of the warrants of the Navy Board.&#x2014;The warrant of the 5th of Dec. 1783, to the officers of the several Yards, appears to have been intended to contain full directions for the employment of the Caulkers, as it is prefaced by saying, "Having considered "the necessary orders to be established "with respect to the Caulkers working by "stint, these are to direct and require you "to observe the following Rules, and con-"form to the Tables herewith sent you, "which are those at present in use. The Table of work to be performed on new ships bottoms is copied from the former warrant, but inaccurately, both to the officers of Plymouth and Portsmouth Yards, as it makes no provision for the quantity of work to be per formed on bottoms of two inches and one inch and a half thick in the single day, although it points out what is to be done in one tide, two tides, and in the extra day or night, and it appears the officers of Plymouth Yard have governed themselves by the quantities contained in the former warrant, but the officers of Portsmouth Yard have only required the men to caulk 38 feet of scan of 1&#x00BD; inch plank for the single day's pay, being two feet a day less for each man than has been performed at Plymouth.&#x2014;The other tables alluded to are for caulking ships topsides and decks, and for caulking old work, in which are stated the quantities of work to be performed for the single day's pay, one tide, and two tides extra; but tin officers of the different Yards have been, and indeed are at present, left to their own discretion as to the quantity of work to be per formed for the double and treble day's pay at which, or greater rates of extra, the caulkers were employed all the last war.&#x2014;The officers of Plymouth Yard, not pursuing the principle laid down by the Navy Board of reducing the quantity of work for the second day's pay, have required that the men, when
<col>1032</col>
employed on old work, should perform as much work for the second and third day's pay as for the first; but the officers of Portsmouth Yard, in the exercise of this discretion, have reduced the work to be performed for the second and third day's pay, so that at Plymouth in caulking decks there has been performed for the double day's pay, or 4s. 2d. 152 feet of seam; at Portsmouth only 139&#x00BD;; and for the treble day's pay, or 6s. 3d. at Plymouth, 228 feet; at Portsmouth only 202&#x2154;0. How this warrant has been acted upon at the other Yards, we have not thought it necessary to enquire; but certainly no actual discretion was given by this warrant to the officers of either of the Yards, who, instead of applying to the Board for directions, acted upon their own ideas of its intention, and as in other instances which we have had occasion to notice, they acted differently, and thereby endangered the creating of dissatisfaction amongst the workmen.&#x2014;It appears to us, that the officers of the Yards are averse to making applications to the Navy Board, but whether it proceeds from their applications being unnoticed, as in the instance of the Plymouth Officers Proposals for intermediate prices for the Repairs of Boats, or from other more direct discouragement, we know not; but we think all Representations from them should be encouraged, as, being entrusted with the execution of the Board's Orders, they have a nearer view of their effects, and of the necessity for altering them.&#x2014;The Navy Board, by their warrants respecting the Caulkers, term all new work, Stint, and old work, Job; but another distinction obtains in Plymouth Yard, the caulking of new work on ships bottoms from the upper streak of the wale downwards, is called Task; the caulking of their topsides and decks, and all old work, is called Stint, and all other works that cannot be measured, such as paying ships topsides, and bends, and reaving work, which is pulling the oakum out of the seams for the purpose of airing the ships in a stale of ordinary, is called Job.&#x2014;The Caulkers remain in the Yard the same time as the other artificers, except when employed on Task work; they are then allowed to quit the Yard at certain hours fixed by the master shipwright, provided their work is done.&#x2014;The foreman of the Caulkers is in the practice of rendering to the master shipwright every morning at 10, or before, Notes containing the names of the Caulkers, and an Account of the Works they are to be employed upon in the course of the day; from
<image src="S1V0003P0I0531"/>
<col>1033</col>
these, the Notes to the clerk of the checque for their payment are made out which are signed by the master shipwright, and his assistants, for the ships they severally superintend; and the quantity of scam each man is to caulk is stated in them, according to the nature of the work they have been employed upon; and at the foot of such notes the foreman of the Caulkers certifies, that the established quantity of seam has been caulked to entitle the men to two or three day's pay for one, according to the rate they may have been directed to work. These Certificates, except when the men are employed on new work, are, from several causes, seldom founded in truth. The men are frequently removed from one ship to another in the course of the day; much time is lost by them in going to and from the ships in Plymouth Sound and Cawsand Bay; and the Navy Board have very properly, in caulking old work, directed that care shall be taken to reave or pull out the wet and decayed oakum before the seams be caulked, but no provision has been made for paying the men whilst so employed; it has not been usual to notice any of these circumstances either in the notes or certificates, but the established quantity of work has been regularly certified to have been performed the same as if the men had been constantly and steadily at work on the same ship the whole time: the plea urged in defence of this fallacious practice is custom, but we think it cannot be too soon put a stop to, for we apprehend where officers are of necessity in the daily practice of certifying untruths, or even certifying that to be true of which they have not competent knowledge (which is the case of most of the officers who sign the Job Notes) that such practice must necessarily produce an indifference about the truth of any other documents they may have to sign, to the great injury of the public service.&#x2014;The master shipwright and the assistants of Plymouth Yard, in their letter of the 13th of Aug. last to the Navy Board, stated, that it was not possible for them to give that attention to the works carrying on by the different branches of artificers, which would enable them to sign, with any truth or propriety, the certificates that the works stated in the notes had been performed, and that the workmen had exerted themselves, and were in their opinion deserving of the rates of pay allowed; and therefore proposed, that the masters who superintended the works carrying on in the several branches should sign such certificates; but the Navy Board, in
<col>1034</col>
their reply of the 17th, say, they see no good reason for deviating from the established practice of the officers certifying that the works have been performed. We cannot agree in opinion with the Navy Board; and, if the reason before offered should not be found sufficient, we have further to add, that it is taking up the time of the assistants to the master shipwright which ought to be employed in attending to their professional duties, and that by making them parties to transactions of which they have little knowledge, and which may or may not be fraudulent, their endeavours to discover frauds may be prevented by the apprehension that such discoveries might reflect upon their own conduct; but we see the necessity of the master shipwright's approving all notes as far as his knowledge goes, by which the wages of the workmen in his department are set off on the Pay Books; and, that he may be better able to judge of their propriety, we think the daily wages earned by the persons stated, should be calculated, and set off on each note; and we also think that the certificates of the works having been actually performed, should be signed by the masters or foremen in the several branches, who superintended the works whilst carrying on.&#x2014;The practice of certifying that works had been performed by the Caulkers which had not, was suspended in Aug. last, in consequence of one of the assistants pointing out its impropriety to the foreman of the Caulkers, who applied to the master shipwright for his directions; but whether the practice has or has not been resumed, we do not know.&#x2014;Before the appointment of the present foreman of the Caulkers, there were frequent instances of men having been paid for working on Sundays, and for sleeping on board his Majesty's ships, when they had neither done the one or the other. This practice was represented by the present foreman to commissioner Fanshawe, and enquired into by a Committee of the Navy Board in Feb. 1802, and the then foreman of the Caulkers was dismissed.&#x2014;The foreman of the Caulkers, the principal officer in this department, has no instructions for his guidance: we think it necessary that he should have instructions; and that no falsification in any of the accounts rendered by the officers should be permitted.&#x2014;If it should be thought right to continue to employ the Caulkers by Task, Stint, and Job, the Tables by which they are at present employed will require considerable additions and amendments; but we think there are material ob-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0532"/>
<col>1035</col>
jections to the employing them by the piece: for it must, as a general principle, be admitted, that work is usually performed better by the day, than by Contract or Piece Work; and as the safety of his Majesty's ships, their preservation from decay by reaving out the wet and decayed oakum, and their continuing in a state for sea service, very much depends on the caulking, we are therefore of opinion, that it would be better to employ the Caulkers by the day.</p>

<title>JOINERS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01793">Their present Rate of Daily Pay, including Allowances, is 2s. 4&#x00BD;d.&#x2014;The Joiners were employed by the Day until the 2d of June 1774, when the Navy Board established a Scheme for employing them by task, to which several additions have been made by warrants dated the 22d March 1775, the 13th June 1785, and the 22d of Feb. 1786.&#x2014;They were first employed by Job on the 12th Jan. 1793, and by the Navy Board's warrant of the 7th Oct. 1794, fixing the mode in which the different classes of workmen were to be employed, the Joiners were directed to be allowed the rate of double days when employed by Task or Job; and those not working by Task or Job, two tides day work.&#x2014;Under the authority of that warrant, the Joiners were employed by Task and Job, at the rate of two for one, or 4s. a day, in the common working hours.&#x2014;The warrant of the 7th Oct. 1794, directed that the officers should propose to the Navy Board, from time to time, such articles of Task and Job work as they might think it right to employ the workmen upon, agreeably to the standing orders they were under on that head.&#x2014;From the nature of the naval service, it is impossible at the beginning of a month to foresee all the various occasional works which may arise in the course of it; it has consequently happened, that the actual employment of the Joiners has differed, in most cases, especially in war time, from the Propositions made to the Navy Board; this seems in some degree to have been foreseen by the Board, from their requiring at the end of each month an Account of the Jobs actually performed, with the earnings of the men; but it is stated, that this Account was required to be transmitted at so early a period after the expiration of the month, that it was impossible to state correctly either the works which had been performed in the month, or the wages which the men bad earned.&#x2014;In the Propositions,
<col>1036</col>
such works were mentioned as could be foreseen; and as no prices were ever fixed for the Joiners Job work, the officers set against each article a Number of Men, and the Time in which they judged it ought to be performed, with a sum of money equal to the amount of the wages of the men, calculated at the rate of two for one, or 4s. a day.&#x2014;On the 11th of June 1803, the officers of Plymouth Yard proposed to the Navy Board to discontinue the propositions made to them monthly of the Jobs on which it was intended that the workmen should be employed, and that the account sent at the end of each month should be an Account of the work bona fide performed, and each article valued according to the best of their judgment, which was approved by the Navy Board, and directed to be carried into effect by warrant dated the 17th of June 1803.&#x2014;That the fallacy previously practised in the Propositions to the Navy Board, and in, the Accounts of the Employment and Earnings of the people, should not have been discovered by them, it is only possible to account for by concluding, that the accounts were passed by without the slightest examination, as, upon the most cursory inspection, the incorrectness of them must have been manifest.</p>

<title>HOUSE CARPENTERS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01794">The present rate of daily pay of the House Carpenters, including allowances, is 2s. 2&#x00BD;d. They were generally employed by the day until 1793, although it appears they have been occasionally employed by Task or Piece Work from the year 1765, whenever considerable works, with prices to be allowed for the same, could be proposed to the Navy Board; but it does not appear they were employed by Job until 12th Jan. 1793.&#x2014;The Navy Board, by their warrant of the 7th Oct. 1794, respecting the mode of employing the different classes of artificers, directed that the House Carpenters should be employed at the rate of two for one by Task or Job, in the common working hours of the Yard; and that the officers should propose to them from time to time, such Task or Job work as they might think it right the men should be employed upon, together with the prices to be allowed for the same, either prior to taking the works in hand, or at the end of every month, for their approval, and orders thereon.&#x2014;No prices were established for the works performed by the House Carpenters by Job; but the Propositions of the Jobs to the Navy Board, and
<image src="S1V0003P0I0533"/>
<col>1037</col>
the accounts of the work performed, were made out in the same fallacious manner as we have just before detailed in treating of the Joiners.&#x2014;When the House Carpenters were employed two tides, or one night extra, during the late war, and which they constantly were from 1st Dec. 1798 to 11th Oct. 1801, and their wages thereby increased from 3s. 8d. to 4s. 8d. or to 5s. 6d. a day, no additional works were proposed or reported to the Navy Board, as having been performed by them; nor was it ascertained, or attempted to be ascertained by the officers, that the men had performed work equal to such extraordinary wages; to which may be added the allowance for chips and lodging, making their daily wages, when employed at the rate of three for one, 5s. 10&#x00BD;d. The men were indeed obliged to remain in the Yard, to entitle them to such wages, the hours equal to the extra time they might be directed to work; but no account was taken of the works actually performed by them until Jan. 1803.&#x2014;The master shipwright and other officers of the Yard, convinced of the great impropriety of the Accounts which had been rendered of the House Carpenters work, wrote to the Navy Board on 11th June 1803, and proposed, that the Propositions for Works to be performed in the ensuing months, should be discontinued, and that the Accounts rendered at the end of the month should contain the works actually performed, with prices, for their approval; this suggestion the Navy Board adopted by their warrant of the 17th June, and the first Account rendered to the Board of the works actually performed by the House Carpenters by Job, was for the month of May 1803.&#x2014;Since that time Accounts have been taken of all the works performed by the House Carpenters, as nearly as circumstances would admit, and the men paid at such rates as the master shipwright thought right, taking care the amount of the earnings of the men was equal thereto.&#x2014;The master House Carpenter is of opinion, that it is impossible to pay the House Carpenters fairly and equitably for all their labour by Job, and that about one-sixth of the whole work must be performed by the day, from its being impracticable to render accounts of, and value the minute and trifling articles of repairs; in this opinion we most perfectly coincide. He also thinks it will require the time and employment of two persons to value and take account of the works in this branch that can be performed by Job.&#x2014;It has been stated to us, that in setting off the wages of
<col>1038</col>
the House Carpenters on the pay books during the late war, reference was had to the Task and Job Notes, to see that their amounts were equal to the wages of the men, at the rate of two for one, but that the wages for the extra time were set off under the authority of the general notes from the master shipwright to the clerk of the checque, stating the rates of extra at which the different classes of artificers were to be employed, until further order.&#x2014;It must seem extraordinary, that the Navy Board should never have discovered the fallacy of the accounts rendered to them, and that the wages actually paid to the men very much exceeded the sums they were reported to have earned. It is only to be accounted for by supposing that neither the Accounts or Pay Books were examined; the latter is admitted, and the former is but too evident.&#x2014;It may be asked, if due attention was not paid to the examination of the books and accounts at the Navy Office, what could induce the officers of the Yard to lose sight of their duty? The answer is plain; the shipwright officers, and indeed the masters and foremen of all the other classes of artificers, were interested in the amount of the wages of the workmen, inasmuch as their apprentices, from whose wages they derived the most considerable part of their known emoluments, were paid in proportion thereto, until the Regulations directed by the King in Council took place in July 1801; and it has been proved to us, that one of the master shipwrights of this Yard, and other persons during the late war, were in the practice of receiving considerable sums of money, from individuals for getting them entered as workmen in the Yard, an equal proof of the misconduct and rapacity of the officers, and of the high wages and advantages by which the workmen expected to be reimbursed. We feel ourselves called upon to say, that we trust and believe, that this shameful practice has not been pursued by any others than the persons alluded to.</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01795">The Masons, as well as the Bricklayers and the Labourers attached to them, are under the direction of the Master Bricklayer.&#x2014;The present rate of daily pay of the Masons is 2s. 6&#x00BD;d.; of the Bricklayers 1s. 11&#x00BD;d.; and of their Labourers 1s. 5d. including allowances.&#x2014;The Masons and Bricklayers were among the first classes of workmen
<image src="S1V0003P0I0534"/>
<col>1039</col>
who were employed by Task or Piece work, as far back as 1765, in altering and repairing the drains of the South Dock; when as the work could be ascertained, and prices set for it previous to its being taken in hand, the Navy Board authorized its being performed by Task at the prices which they had approved; and in the same manner they have been employed by Task since that period, when any new works have been carrying on, or in cases similar to that before mentioned, where the work could be previously taken account of, and prices fixed for it.&#x2014;The Masons, Bricklayers, and their Labourers, were first employed by Job in Jan. 1793, and by the Navy Board's warrant of the 7th Oct. 1794,fixingthe mode in which the different classes of workmen were to be employed, the Masons, Bricklayers, and their Labourers, were directed to be employed double days, by Task and Job, and those not working by Task or Job, one or two tides day work.&#x2014;Under the authority of that warrant, these classes of workmen were employed by Task and Job at the rate of two for one, or double pay, in the common working hours. The Propositions of the Jobs to the Navy Board, and the Accounts of the work performed, with the men and servant's earnings, were made out in the same fallacious way as those of the Joiners until March 1802, when the master shipwright directed that the whole of the work performed, whether by Task or Job, should be detailed and valued according to the judgment of the master bricklayer.&#x2014;The general employment of the Masons and Bricklayers is in putting up the fire-hearths and fixing the coppers on board ships, and keeping in repair the various buildings in the Yard, in the performance of which they cannot possibly be employed strictly by the Piece; the warrant of the 7th Oct. 1794, therefore, can only be considered as doubling their daily rate of pay.</p>

<title>SAWYERS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01796">The employment of the Sawyers has differed very materially from every other class of workmen in his Majesty's Yards; until very lately, the greater part of them were not considered as belonging to the Yard, nor were they entitled to the superannuation and other indulgencies granted to the rest of the workmen: they worked under an agreement or contract, dated 22d April 1696, at a certain rate per 100 feet, and have from that circumstance been termed Contract or 100 feet Sawyers.&#x2014;The contract or scheme
<col>1040</col>
under which the Sawyers were employed, was not in existence at Plymouth Yard, but the measurers were governed by precedent in the rates for the different sorts of work.&#x2014;The daily rate of pay of the pair of day Sawyers borne on the Books or the Yard, was 2s. 4&#x00BD;d. for the Topman, and 1s. 10d. for the Pitman. They were generally employed on light work, and such as could not be paid for by measurement; but as the work of this nature could not always be performed by one pair of Sawyers, the contract or 100 feet Sawyers were occasionally employed by the day at the same rates as the day Sawyers. In the accounts rendered by the measurers to the clerk of the checque, they were not stated to have been so employed; but a fallacious quantity of work was set against their names, equal in value to the amount of their pay for the time.&#x2014;In the course of this Report, we have frequently had occasion to notice the practice pursued by the Navy Board of transferring the responsibility of every measure, however trifling, from themselves to their subordinates, from which circumstance, it is impossible for the officers to act up to the spirit of the orders they receive, and the result too often is a general negligence of the whole; in this instance of the Sawyers, all that the Navy Board could reasonably have required of the officers who superintended them, was, that they should keep the men diligently to their work, and in case of neglect, report the offenders to their superior officer, in order to their being mulcted or discharged.</p>

<title>SMITHS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01797">The Smiths are also allowed for working on Sundays, and for the night or extra day an additional day's pay. The Smith's night, or extra day formerly consisted of 8 hours additional employment; about 30 years ago it was reduced to 5, and in 1795 it was further reduced to 3, two hours less than the other artificers work for an extra day's pay: for &#x00BD; a day's extra, the Smiths work 2 hours; and for &#x00BC; of a day, an hour and a quarter.&#x2014;The Smiths are also allowed by the Navy Board's warrant of the 28th July 1800, when employed on common work, two quarts of table-beer each per day, and an equal quantity for every extra day or night they may work.&#x2014;In addition to the above, when employed in making anchors from 10 to 40 cwt. and repairing those above 10 cwt. they are each allowed a quart of strong beer per day; and when making anchors above 40
<image src="S1V0003P0I0535"/>
<col>1041</col>
cwt. they are allowed three pints; and the foreman of the first fire has an additional pint by the Navy Board's Warrant of the 20th Jan. 1727.&#x2014;We should not have detailed this confused mass of allowances, and of the inconsistent time of working for the rates of pay prescribed, but to point out the necessity of their being simplified.&#x2014;The Smiths are the only class of artificers whose pay has riot been doubled by the fallacy of calling their employment Job or Task; they receive only single day's pay for working in the usual hours, which are for the Smiths, from 6 in the morning to 6 in the evening in summer, and in winter from 6 in the morning to dusk.</p>

<title>PAINTERS:</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01799">The Paint Work was formerly performed by contract; but in 1802, in consequence of gross neglect having been discovered in the mode of keeping the accounts, and making the payments to the contractor, whereby great opportunity for fraud was afforded, it was judged advisable that the materials should be provided by public contract, and that the work should be performed by men to be entered in the Yard for the purpose.&#x2014;We are at a loss to account for the reasons which induced the Navy Board, in 1802, to employ the Painters by day-work at fixed rates of pay, instead of employing them by Task and Job, like the other workmen, as the members we have examined have stated to us, that they are not conscious of the fallacy
<col>1042</col>
which has generally pervaded the system of Piece Work; and still continue of opinion, that most of the workmen may be advantageously employed according to that mode; when it must be manifest, that the work of many of the classes will not admit of such an employment with equal propriety as the painters.&#x2014;Whatever inducement may lave operated with the Navy Board in the adoption of the measure, it certainly meets with our approbation; but we think the wages of the Painters were established without due consideration, as the sum given them per hour when employed extra, bears no proportion to their daily pay.</p>

In the selection of persons for these situations a preference is given to men of good character, advanced in years, and such as may have received hurts in the service; yet, as a very considerable trust is reposed in them, and as abilities above the common class of workmen are requisite for keeping their accounts with regularity, we are of opinion that as they attend the same number of hours as lie workmen, their rate of wages should not be less than that of the class from which they may be taken.</p>

<image src="S1V0003P0I0536"/>
<col>1043</col>
was a misunderstanding amongst the officers of that Yard, which is said to have been injurious to the public service, of which we shall speak hereafter, we are not disposed to go into that subject, as the person from whom we received the information might be influenced by such misunderstanding; it however appears to us extraordinary, that there should have been on an average, during the late war, 25 Labourers employed in Plymouth Yard in each year more than in Portsmouth Yard.&#x2014;As a strong proof that the wages of the Labourers during the late war were higher than they ought to have been, various sums from 2 to 10 guineas were paid by many of them to persons for getting them entered in the Yard.</p>

<title>HORSES.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01802">The Horses employed in the Dock Yards have, we understand, been always provided by contract; the Teams are borne on the muster and pay books, and the contractors paid for their labour quarterly, one quarter under the other the same as the artificers.&#x2014;The Labourers have been long employed in the receipt of stores and other works by Task, and in the warrant of 2d Sept. 1772, the Navy Board expressly state their intention not to employ them extra, or beyond the common working hours of the Yard in future; we therefore apprehend the natural construction of such clause was, that if the labourers performed their task in less time than the usual hours of working, the teams were then to work only the same hours as the labourers. In confirmation of the interpretation which we have given to the clause in question, it is expressly stated to us by Mr. R. Nelson, who held the contract for upwards of 3 years, that he apprehended he was not entitled to any thing beyond the single day's pay unless his teams were employed in extra time, either beyond the usual hours of working, or during the time allowed for dinner. As the extra received by Mr. Nelson was of small amount, he apprehended that it had arisen from the employment of his horses in extra time, and he was only undeceived in that opinion by the production of some of the vouchers on which extra had been set off to his teams in the common working hours, when employed with the labourers on Task work.&#x2014;The teams are and have been employed occasional extra in the night, for the purpose of pumping out the Docks by an engine, for which they are paid according to the provisions of the contract, by certificates from
<col>1044</col>
the master shipwright to the cleric of the checque, of their having been so employed.&#x2014;The contract for the teams was held by Mr. R. Nelson, between the 1st Feb. 1787 and 23d Aug. 1790, at 5s. 10d. per team; having lost about 700l. by it, and the Navy Board not accepting his offer to continue to furnish the teams at 6s. 10d. per day, he relinquished the contract, and it was taken by Mrs. S. Croad at 5s. 3d.&#x2014;On the 8th of May 1794, she represented to the Navy Board, that the high price of men's wages, horses, fodder, &amp;c. would oblige her to give notice for discontinuing the contract, unless she had the same extra for all her teams as the labourers of the Yard were then allowed, two tides; the only extra she received being for 3 teams employed by task, and that not constantly. The Navy Board, in, their reply of the 12th, informed her, they accepted her notice for relinquishing the contract at the expiration of the time limited, and that they should advertise for entering into another.&#x2014;On the 2d Sept. 1794, Mrs. S. Croad entered into another contract for furnishing the teams at 6s. 9d. a day, to commence on the 5th Nov. following; and as she had been refused the extra she applied for, it seems to be evident that she considered the additional shilling a day as an adequate compensation for the fair exertion of her teams in the common working hours.</p>

<title>SAILMAKERS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01803">The Sailmakers appear to have been employed by the day until the 17th of May 1764, when the Navy Board established a scheme for employing them by the Great or Task, in making new sails; and directed that they should sew 44 yards of seam with waxed twine, or 50 with dipped twine, for the single day's pay; twice that quantity for the double day's pay; and in a similar proportion for the intermediate parts of a day. Various other works are required to be performed in making sails, besides sewing the canvas together, the whole of which were directed to be paid for as seam sewed, and various rules were established for estimating the quantities of seam which were to be considered equal to such work. The warrant further directed that the men should be employed by Task on such repairs as would admit of it, and that no persons should work by the day but such as the officers should find to be absolutely necessary to employ in that manner, on account of the nature of the work not admitting, by any regulation, of its being performed by the Great or Task.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0537"/>
<col>1045</col>
The time of the sailmakers remaining in the Yard, according to the different rates of working, was fixed by that warrant; when employed double days they were to come into the Yard at 6 o'clock in the morning, and remain till 8 in the evening.&#x2014;On the 18th Dec. 1802, the Navy Board, having taken into their consideration the reports from the officers, directed the sailmakers task for the single day's pay in all the Yards to be increased from 44 yards of seam to 50 with waxed twine, and from 50 to 57 with dipped twine; and, to prevent their slighting their work, that such Task should not be performed in less than 5 hours, although by the former warrant 9 hours appear to have been considered necessary for performing a Jess quantity of work for the single day's pay. This increase of the Sailmakers task, after the former warrant had been acted upon for 38 years, was tantamount to a reduction of 12 per cent. in their pay, although the prices of many of the necessaries of life had been doubled since that rate of proportion of pay was established by the scheme of task; this circumstance strongly proves, what we have before had frequent occasion to remark, the inconsiderate manner in which Task and Job or Piece Work has been introduced into the Dock Yards.&#x2014;The Sailmakers, since the date of the first warrant, have been considered to be employed by task, and they have been paid by notes from the master sailmaker to the clerk of the checque, in which the quantity of seam each individual ought to have sewn, to entitle him to the wages authorized from time to time by the Navy Board, has generally been entered; but although the men are employed pearly as much upon alterations and repairs as in making new sails, we found, upon examining the master sailmaker, that it was usual to note the time the men were employed upon alterations and repairs, but that no account was taken of the work performed by them; although he was in the constant practice of entering a specific quantity in the notes to the clerk of the checque, so as to give them the same rate of wages as those employed by task, or on new work.&#x2014;Having observed that the quantities of work entered in the notes given weekly by the master sailmaker to the clerk of the checque, were frequently struck out, and that greater quantities were inserted, we were led to en quire into the cause of this practice, and found, that it had been usual for the clerk of the checque's clerk to cast the work previous to his setting off the wages, and if the

work stated to have been performed was found to be unequal to the rate of wages authorized by the Navy Board, he returned the notes to the master sailmaker for correction; who in such cases had reference to his progress book, and if he found the men had attended in the Yard more time than the work stated was equal to, he altered the quantities accordingly; this circumstance proves that the accounts kept must have been very irregular, and leads us to doubt, whether any of the Sailmakers have been strictly employed by task.&#x2014;As a great part of the work performed by the Sailmakers consists of repairs and alterations, which, we are told, cannot be done by task, and that when they are so employed, no account is taken of their work, it must seem extraordinary that the whole of the Sailmakers for 40 years should have been considered to be employed by task, and that the precise quantity of work directed by the Navy Board should have been certified to have been performed by each man, to entitle him to the wages authorized from time to time to be paid. We cannot but disapprove a system which betrays so total an indifference for the truth, but under the existing orders, we are not surprized at the practice having been pursued; for if the men on repairs and alterations work as diligently as those making new sails, although not employed by task, there can be no good reason offered why the former should work twelve hours for the single day's pay, which the latter are allowed to earn hi 5; and yet, without the fallacy adopted by the master sailmaker, this must have been the case.</p>

<title>RIGGERS AND RIGGERS LABOURERS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01804">The daily rate of pay of the Riggers appears to have been established on the 1st of Jan. 1603&#x2013;4, and that of their Labourers to have been allowed in Dec. 1690; they were then, and are at present paid when employed on Sundays, and for working beyond the usual hours of the Yard, for a night, or five hours additional employment, an extra day's pay; and for a tide, or one hour and a half additional employment, they are both paid 4d.&#x2014;They are also allowed 3d. per day in lieu of the privilege of carrying chips out of die Yard, making the present rate of daily pay of the Riggers 1s. 9d. and of their Labourers 1s. 5d.&#x2014;The Riggers and their Labourers had always been employed by the day, working such occasional extra as the service required, until the 26th Oct. 1801, although during the late war they had gene-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0538"/>
<col>1047</col>
rally been employed at the rate of 2 for 1, but then they always stayed the time in the Yard, 5 hours for the extra day's pay, working by candlelight from Michaelmas to Lady Day until 8 o'clock in the evening.&#x2014;The Navy Board, by their warrant of the 10th of Oct. 1801, at the conclusion of the last war, directed the officers of Plymouth Yard, as the daylight would no longer allow of the artificers working the extra they had been accustomed to do, to employ them at the rate of double days during the winter; by which it was understood by the clerk of the checque, that none of the workmen were to be employed in extra time, or beyond the usual working hours of the Yard, and notice was given, to the workmen accordingly; in consequence of which the master's attendant, under whom the Riggers are employed, in their letter to the Navy Board of the 14th, represented that the duty of the rigging house men was then as arduous as it had been at any period of the war; that it was likely to be still more so in the approaching winter, and that they did not see any probability of the service admitting a reduction of the extra they were then working, one night; they therefore expressed a hope that it was the intention of the Board the Riggers should work the same extra as the other workmen.&#x2014;The Navy Board in reply thereto, by their warrant of the 16th, directed the Riggers and their Labourers to be employed double days, the same as the other artificers.&#x2014;The clerk of the checque's first clerk, on the 19th of Oct. wrote to the Navy Board to say, that doubts had arisen on their warrantor the 16th, whether the Riggers and their Labourers were, or were not, to be employed by candlelight during the winter; and expressly stated they were not employed by task or job, the same as the other artificers, and therefore desired to know, if when they were employed double days, they were to continue to work by candlelight until 8 o'clock in the evening from Michaelmas to Lady Day, agreeably to the warrant of 11th of Jan. 1796. It was obviously the request of the masters attendant that they should so remain in the Yard, and the Navy Board's warrant of the 16th would have been so understood, had it not directed that the Riggers should be employed double days, "the same as the other ar-"tificers" then working by task or job.&#x2014;The Navy Board, in their reply of the 24th of Oct. 1801, to the officers of the Yard, stated, that they did not approve of the Riggers being employed by candlelight, and
<col>1048</col>
said, if they could not earn double days pay by daylight by job or task work, they could only be allowed what they did earn; since which time, although no prices have been fixed by the Navy Board, or proposed by the officers for the works performed, as directed by the Navy Board's warrant of 7th Oct. 1794, the Riggers and their Labourers have been paid as if employed by job, at the rate of 2 days pay for 1, by quarterly notes from the master attendant to the clerk of the checque, simply stating that the Riggers and their Labourers had been employed at the rate of 2 for 1, by which notes the Riggers received 5s. 3d. and their Labourers 2s. 7d. a day, including the allowance in lieu of chips, for working in the common hours of the Yard. Since the present war they have been employed 1 and 2 tides extra, as the daylight would admit, making the wages of the Riggers in the latter case 3s. 11d. and of their Labourers 3s. 3d. a day, including the said allowance.&#x2014;As the Riggers and their Labourers had been continued at single day's pay for working in the usual hours of the Yard all the late war, and during the time of the scarcity of provisions, we can see no good reason for doubling their pay by a fallacious expedient on the return of peace, when the prices of the necessaries of life had fallen considerably. We here feel it to be our duty to say, that the Navy Board's warrant of the 24th Oct. 1801, manifested a great want of attention to the business of the Yard, and to the public interest; inasmuch as it suggested to the officers the fallacious mode of doubling the pay of the men, by calling their employment job or task, although no prices were or have been established for any one article of work performed by them; and indeed it seems to be generally admitted, that they cannot be employed by task or job, except in fitting new rigging; but it appears to us the riggers are so frequently broken off, for the purpose of attending his Majesty's ships coming into and going out of port, and on other occasions, that it is even in this case impracticable to pay them equitably for their labour by task or job.&#x2014;The pay of the Riggers, including their allowance for chips, making their daily rate of wages 1s. 9d. and of their Labourers 1s. 5d. appears to us to have been low previous to the 24th of Oct. 1801; but surely the doubling of it, and that by a fallacious mode, which we think cannot be too strongly reprobated, was highly improper.&#x2014;The Comptroller of the Navy has stated to us, that it was not the intention of the Navy
<image src="S1V0003P0I0539"/>
<col>1049</col>
Board, that they should receive double pay for working in the common hours of the Yard; but unless it was the intention of the Navy Board, we are at a loss to account for their having been so paid from the 26th of Oct. 1801 to the present time; as that rate and mode of working has been constantly stated in the weekly returns made to the Board by the masters attendant, under whose direction the men are employed.&#x2014;The Riggers are frequently obliged to remain in the Yard after the usual hours of working, from the nature of their employment, that of attending to the ships coming into and going out of port, and transporting those in ordinary from one part of the port to another, and would probably have been perfectly satisfied by earning the extra day's pay as formerly, by working or staying in the Yard the five additional hours; we say, staying in the Yard, because we understand they sometimes do so without working, waiting for the ships coming into or going out of port.&#x2014;We are very far from thinking the workmen employed in the public service should not be fairly and equitably paid, and we conceive it must be admitted, that wages established more than a century ago ought to have been increased before the present period; but there are many reasons to be offered against their receiving extraordinary or extravagant, wages; the wages paid in the Yards must necessarily affect the prices of labour to be paid to similar classes of workmen in their vicinity. We are of opinion, that due encouragement should be held forth to induce the most able and industrious workmen to enter into his Majesty's service, but we think such encouragement should consist of promotion to the meritorious, and of acts of beneficence to old and worn-out servants, and to such persons who, from receiving injuries in the public service, may be deprived of the means of earning a livelihood.&#x2014;Particular attention should be had in establishing or altering the pay of any class of workmen, to the relative proportion of the wages of the other classes, to prevent that dissatisfaction which the raising of the pay of some classes above the proportion of others usually creates, even amongst those who were before perfectly contented.</p>

<title>THE ORDINARY.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01805">The Ordinary are a class of persons distinct from the establishment of the Yard, and are so termed from their being usually employed on board his majesty's ships not in commission or actual service, but in a state of Ordinary; they perform the duties
<col>1050</col>
of the port afloat, such as masting, unmasting, ballasting, unballasting, scraping, cleaning, airing, watching and warding, and transporting his majesty's ships from one part of the port to another, and in preparing them for dock; they are also employed in lifting and repairing the moorings, and in the necessary works in the master attendants line in the Yard.&#x2014;At the time of the late admiralty visitation in August 1802, the Ordinary were directed to be employed in the boats allotted to the different officers of the Yard for the performance of their several duties, instead of scavelmen and labourers, and in compliance with such directions, they are employed in the boats of the clerk of the checque, masters attendant, and clerk of the survey; but the boats in the master shipwright's department are, it is said, from the Ordinary being short, still manned by scavelmen or labourers. The number of persons borne on the books of the Ordinary in 1793, exclusive of the warrant officers and their servants, was 379; they were increased during the late war to 452; the number at present borne is 430; and about one-third of them sleep on board the ships in ordinary, week and week about, for the purposes before described. Their pay per month of 28 days, exclusive of the 6d. deducted for the use of the chest formerly at Chatham, and of the 1s. per month for Greenwich hospital, is 22s. 6d. the same as was allowed to the able seamen of the fleet previous to the increase granted in the year 1797; and they are allowed what is termed extra petty warrant provisions, being something less than, and supposed to be of inferior quality to the provisions allowed to the seamen and others serving on board the fleet. Such of the Ordinary as are employed in navigating transports carrying stores from one Yard to another, are allowed the increased able seamen's pay (28s. per month, exclusive of the said deductions) and provisions; and in addition thereto they are allowed a certain sum per voyage.&#x2014;The Ordinary are employed under the direction of the masters attendant, and except those watching and warding the ships, are mustered by the masters attendant's clerk in summer at 7 o'clock in the morning; in the spring and autumn at half past 7; and in the winter at 8 o'clock; the duties they are to perform in the course of the day are then allotted by the master attendant, and lists of the men who are to perform the different services are given to the leading men of the riggers, and to the boatswains of the ships in ordinary, who
<image src="S1V0003P0I0540"/>
<col>1051</col>
superintend the works carrying on: when the works are performed, the men are allowed to quit the Yard, but they are not mustered on leaving off work, the same as the other workmen, from which circumstance we are inclined to think the idle may Contrive to quit the Yard, and possibly at times with the connivance of the officers, and thereby elude the performance of their share of work.&#x2014;Formerly it was usual to checque such as absented themselves from their duly, of their pay only, but about 2 years ago the commissioner directed they should also be checqued of their provisions. Prior to the establishment of the late regulations in July 1801, it was usual to grant them indulgences by leave of absence, and to take off their checques when absent without leave, by which they received both pay and provisions; but since those regulations have been established, we are told they have been very punctually checqued when absent, that no checques have been taken off, and that no men are now allowed to be absent without the commissioner's leave, when they are checqued both of their pay and provisions&#x2014;The Ordinary are said to be very regular in their attendance to their duty; if they absent themselves for 3 successive days without leave, they are in general discharged.&#x2014;It had been usual for such of the ordinary as were employed in the boats of the commissioner, clerk of the checque, and surveying master, to be victualled on going on board his majesty's ships on duty in the Sound and Cawsand bay; and not being checqued of their provisions in the Ordinary, they received double rations; but this practice was put a stop to by the lords of the Admiralty at the time of their late visitation.&#x2014;The Ordinary belonging to the boats of the officers of the Yard are not employed on any other service; but as we understand some of the boats are not employed for days together, particularly in time of peace, we think that works ought to be allotted to them to perform, when they are not actually employed in the boats.&#x2014;We think the pay of the Ordinary should be the same as the pay at present allowed to the able seamen of his majesty's fleet, as it always was so until the addition granted in the year 1797; and, that service may be performed adequate to such increase of pay, we recommend that their hours of attendance be from 6 to 6, the same as the other workmen.&#x2014;We also think that instead of employing contract riggers, a saving may be made, by selecting a gang of men from the Ordinary for the
<col>1052</col>
purpose of rigging his majesty's ships at the commencement of war, to be paid, by certificate from the master attendant, a certain sum for each class of ship in addition to their usual pay, provided none of the stores are embezzled.&#x2014;We further think it may at times be advantageous to employ the Ordinary, at the seasons of the year when the deliveries are greatest, and, when they can be spared from their usual duties, to assist in unlading the vessels, and housing the stores brought to the Yard.&#x2014;Having understood that there were frequent complaints of the badness of the provisions issued to the Ordinary, and that they frequently sold them, we called upon the commissioners of the victualling for an account of the provisions issued, and of the average daily expence of the rations for one man, in order to judge whether it might be more advantageous to the public and to the individuals that they should have a fixed rate of pay, and find themselves in provisions. By the return made, it appears the actual expence of the provisions issued to each man per month of 28 days, is about 1l. 8s. making the expence of each man to the public, at the present rate of pay, about 1s. 10&#x00BC;d. a day. We do not feel ourselves competent to give a decided opinion on this subject, but we think the suggestion is well deserving the attention of the public Boards; as we conceive it cannot be the intention or wish of government to make any allowance to its servants, where the expence of providing such allowance is greater than the value of it to the individuals receiving it.</p>

<title>ROPEMAKERS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01806">We have in a preceding part of this Report stated, that the Ropemakers are a distinct and separate branch; they are employed under the management and direction of 2 officers, the clerk of the rope yard, and the master ropemaker; the former is the check upon the men's attendance and wages, and the latter allots the work, and superintends the performance of it.&#x2014;All the persons belonging to the rope yard, as well Ropemakers as others, are employed by task or piece work, according to schemes or tables which were adopted on the first establishment of the rope yard in the year 1697, and which have not been revised or altered since that period. The schemes direct the number of men that shall be employed on each article, and the quantity or number of articles to be manufactured by them for a single day's pay.&#x2014;The scheme
<image src="S1V0003P0I0541"/>
<col>1053</col>
for employing the Ropemakers, fixes in many instances the quantity of work to be performed by each man for a day's work, or single day's pay; but where the articles to be manufactured require the united exertions of many, the scheme fixes the number of men by whom the articles are to be made.&#x2014;The names of the men are called over on their coming to work in the morning by the clerk of the rope yard, or his clerk, who, immediately after the muster, gives to the master Ropemaker an account of the numbers of each class who have answered to their names, or are present in the Yard; the master Ropemaker then allots the work to be performed in the course of the day, by directing the number of men, as prescribed by the Navy Board, to be employed on the several articles of work; and he every evening renders an account thereof to the clerk of the rope yard, which is called a "Progress."&#x2014;When the men employed on the different works have performed their task or stint, they go to the office of the clerk of the rope yard, and are mustered out of the Yard by him or his clerk, except when employed in laying or making ropes; and then the names of the men so employed, and who have performed their stint, are reported to the clerk of the rope yard, or his clerk, by a layer or sub-foreman, and their muster is given to them upon the faith of such report, without their names being called over; but we can see no good reason why they should not be mustered on leaving off work, the same as the other workmen.&#x2014;The clerk of the rope yard is allowed but one clerk, and it is stated to have happened frequently that both the clerk of the rope yard and his clerk have been confined by illness at the same time, in which cases the duty of mustering the men has devolved on one of the foremen; but the notations on the muster book have always been made by the clerk of the rope yard, or his clerk, from the report of the foreman: since the regulations established in 1801, it is stated that no instance of this kind has occurred.&#x2014;There is no actual certificate of the performance of the work given by the master ropemaker to the clerk of the Rope Yard, but the wages of the men are set off by the latter officer at the full rate authorized by the Navy Board, on *he authority of the progress, or the account of the work allotted to the men in the morning by the master ropemaker; each separate body of men is employed under the superintendence of a foreman or sub-foreman,
<col>1054</col>
termed a layer, and it is said they do not permit the men to quit the Yard until they have performed the work allotted to them.&#x2014;As the tables by which the men are employed are pretty generally known, the men are in some measure, when working together, a check upon each other; and it is asserted, that they will not proceed with any work unless the proper number of mew directed by the Navy Board are employed upon it.&#x2014;The Ropemakers have invariably been confined by the Navy Board to certain rates of working, according to the extent and urgency of the demands for cordage; during the late war they were permitted to earn from 2&#x00BD; to 3 days pay, and in Sept last they were working at the latter rate. The people belonging to the Rope Yard, when they have performed the work to entitle them to the rate of pay limited by the Navy Board, are permitted to leave the Yard.&#x2014;The proportion of the different works to be performed for a single day's pay are not fixed upon a fair and equal scale; the Ropemakers employed in parting hemp, that is, making it up into small bundles for the convenience of hatchelling or dressing, can perform their stint of work for a day's pay in 2&#x00BD; hours; the Ropemakers employed in laying or making ropes, in 3 hours; and those employed in spinning, in not less, than 3&#x00BD;, or 4 hours; but in order to render the work as equal as possible, the employment of the people is changed daily, except in parting hemp, for which the most trusty men are selected, because they have access to the storehouses.&#x2014;In making small ropes, the men can perform the stint of work to entitle them to 3 days pay in 8 hours, and on large work it will take them from 12 to 13.&#x2014;In the year 1799, a machine invented by Mr. J. D. Belfour, for making cordage, for which he had procured a patent, was adopted in his Majesty's Yards, and the sum of 4000l. was paid by the Navy Board to Mr. Belfour for his superintendence of the erection of the machines, and for permission to work under his patent. An improvement was likewise introduced by Mr. Belfour in the mode of spinning, tending to lessen the labour considerably. Ft was the former practice in spinning to have wheels only at one end of the loft, so that when a man" had spun the thread to the proper length, he had to walk back again to the wheel to make a fresh beginning, and as he returned he unhooked the thread from the hooks placed in the ceiling to receive it as spun. By Mr. Belfour's plan, wheels were fixed at
<image src="S1V0003P0I0542"/>
<col>1055</col>
both ends of the house, so that when a man had spun the thread to its proper length, he had only to turn about, make a fresh beginning, and spin back again to the other end of the loft, and so on alternately: but as he could not throw the yarns off the hooks, it became necessary to employ boys for that purpose, and 20 were entered in Plymouth Yard, by the direction of the Navy Board, at 6d. for a single day; and as their extra pay has been governed by the rate at which the men have been employed, their wages have varied from 1s. to 1s. 6d. a day. When it is considered that these boys are allowed to be entered from 11 to 13 years of age, and that when the Ropemakers are working at the rate of 3 for 1, they can perform their stint of work in less than the common working hours of the Yard, such wages will, we think, be deemed more than adequate to the service they perform.&#x2014;The fixing of wheels at both ends of the house reduced the distance usually walked by the spinners in the course of a day exactly one half, and the professional officers calculate that it reduced their actual labour about one-sixth; but although the public paid a considerable sum of money to Mr. Belfour as a reward for the improvements he introduced, by which the work was rendered much easier to the workmen, and an actual expence was, on that account alone, incurred to the public by the entry of the boys, yet we find that the Navy Board did not in consequence of it require from the spinners any addition to the stint of work originally established for the day's pay.&#x2014;In the course of our enquiry with respect to this class of workmen, it did not appear that it had been a practice to falsify the accounts, by stating men to have performed work when otherwise employed, in order to give them the increased wages authorized by the Navy Board; the only man who has been allowed the same wages as those of the class to which he belonged, and who did not actually work at his trade, is the Key Bearer, whose duly it is to lock up the storehouses and ropehouses after the men quit work; but he has been borne on the books under the specific name of "Key Bearer."&#x2014;It was usual with the Ropemakers, as with the other classes of workmen, to pay to the clerk who kept the check against their wages, a fee quarterly for a note or certificate of the amount of their wages, which, as well as all other fees, were prohibited by the regulations in 1801.&#x2014;The employment of the Ropemakers, and the other persons connected with them by task, appears to have been conducted agreeably to the original in-
<col>1056</col>
tention of the Navy Board; and we are of opinion that this class may be employed with advantage to the service by task or piece work, as the accounts can be kept with ease and precision; but the schemes should be, revised, and the different works made to bear as near a proportion to each other as possible; and we recommend that the key bearer, in case this office should be judged necessary, be allowed a fixed rate of wages proportionate to the trust reposed in him, instead of being paid at the same rate as the working men.&#x2014;In order to establish an additional (and, in our opinion, an effectual) check to the improper payment of wages, we recommend that the clerk of the Rope Yard be instructed to take an account daily of the work performed, in order to check the "Progress" delivered to him by the master ropemaker.</p>

<title>APPRENTICES.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01807">Most of the officers in the professional branches were formerly allowed Apprentices, whose pay and extra they received; and apprentices were also given as a reward for merit and industry to the most deserving of the artificers. The Apprentices to the officers in the shipwright line were in general brought up in the mould loft, to give them a knowledge of the art of shipbuilding, and to qualify them for officers. Their rates of pay for each year of their apprenticeship were fixed, and they were allowed extra in proportion to the workmen with whom they were employed.&#x2014;It has been before stated, that in consequence of great abuses having taken place in the allowance of extra to the officers Apprentices, it was judged expedient in 1801 to abolish that privilege; and as the officers derived the most considerable part of the emoluments of their situations from the pay of their Apprentices, their salaries were in consequence considerably increased, and the Apprentices were permitted to serve out the remainder of their respective limes to government, on the same terms as had been agreed to by their masters. That the Abuse in respect to the extra to the Apprentices had been carried to a great extent, appears by the Statement of the average wages of the officers Apprentices, compared with the average wages of the classes of workmen to which they belonged; as, notwithstanding the daily rate of wages of the Apprentices is considerably less than that of the workmen, the wages of the former have in many instances exceeded those of the latter.
<image src="S1V0003P0I0543"/>
<col>1057</col>
The quartermen of Shipwrights, the foremen and quartermen of Caulkers, and the foremen and leading men in the other trades, have still apprentices; and they are continued to be given to the most deserving of the artificers. Formerly, the whole amount of the wages of the apprentices was received by their respective masters, but in Dec. 1802, a regulation was made by the lords of the admiralty, by which the wages of the apprentices were not suffered to fluctuate with the earnings of the workmen; and a certain part of their pay was given to the parents or guardians of the boys, to maintain them during their apprenticeships.&#x2014;By those regulations, all apprentices were in future to be bound to the principal officer of the trade, and not to any of the inferior artificers; and the allotment of them among the artificers was to be at the discretion of the master shipwright. The artificers to whom they might be allotted were to teach them their trades, and to be called Instructors. The apprentices were, as heretofore, to continue at work the whole of the time that the people did to whom they were attached, but were to have only single day's pay at the established rates; two-thirds of which were to be paid to the instructor, as long as he might conduct himself properly, and the remaining one-third to the parents or guardians of the apprentice, to provide him with food, cloathing, and tools.&#x2014;As the amount of the wages of the apprentices was by these regulations considerably reduced, the inferior officers, such as the quartermen and leading men, who formerly had one apprentice, were now allowed two. The apprentices to the officers of the Smiths and Ropemakers remain on the same footing as formerly. We are not surprised, that on the discovery of the Very gross abuses with respect to the extra wages paid to the apprentices, the admiralty should have ordered that all the apprentices, whether they worked extra or not, should receive only single day's pay. They have lately directed, that the apprentices under the new regulations, after having served three years and a half, and being capable of taking a man's birth, shall be allowed the same extra wages as the class to which they may belong, except for their working on Sundays, and during the time usually allowed for meals, and for sleeping afloat; and that such extra wages be divided between the Instructors and the apprentices, in the same propor-
<col>1058</col>
tion as the daily pay, that is, two-thirds to the former, and one-third to the latter.&#x2014;We are of opinion it might be advantageous to the public service, that the master shipwrights, and the assistants of the several yards, should have the same number of apprentices as formerly; but that they should not be allowed to take any premium, or to derive any advantage from their wages.&#x2014;We conceive persons who are capable of giving, their children the necessary education, and who might be inclined to bind them to particular persons, with a view to their receiving certain attention and instruction for them, would not, under so general a system as the present, be inclined to bind their children to the master shipwright, to be allotted to persons to whom they may be wholly indifferent; and without some regulation of this sort, we are apprehensive there may be a want of persons properly skilled in the art of ship-building, from whom to select officers for the shipwright line.</p>

<title>IRREGULARITIES AND ABUSES.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01808">In the preceding pages we have endeavoured to give account of the regulations at different times established, for the employment and payment of the various classes of workmen in his majesty's yard at Plymouth; and to shew in what manner those Regulations have been earned into execution. In the course of the detail we have made such observations, and suggested such alterations as the circumstances appeared to require. We propose only to add a few general remarks.&#x2014;The Irregularities and Abuses which we have pointed out may be attributed in a great measure to innovations in the mode of employing and paying the workmen, which nave taken place within the last 20 years, and principally during the late war; innovations adopted without due consideration, carried to an extravagant length; and pursued without system, or that degree of attention which is particularly requisite in all new undertakings, to prevent mistakes, and correct such parts as experience may point out to be defective: schemes of Work which, perhaps, might have been introduced with advantage partially, have been adopted generally:&#x2014;An Employment by the Piece or Job: has been directed under circumstance, and in cases where such a mode of employment was impracticable:&#x2014;Irregularity and De-

<col>1059</col>
ception in the Accounts; and a Waste for the public Money have been the consequences.&#x2014;The former mode of employing the artificers in his majesty's Yards at a fixed rate of daily pay for each class, with au addition for extra time, having been abolished, a payment for work by the piece established in its room, and great expectations of advantage held forth from the change, it might reasonably have been expected that some pains would have been taken to ascertain, by a comparison of the actual expence and time employed in similar works under the old and new system, whether any real advantage had accrued by the adoption of the latter, and whether experience sanctioned the preference which had been given to it; and we apprehend, that at the beginning, such a comparison might easily have been made:&#x2014;We hoped to have derived information and assistance from some actual experiments and accounts taken with this view, but in this we were disappointed. The Navy Board were not in possession of any documents or statements by which such a comparison could be made.&#x2014;If the system of Work by the Piece could be fairly and completely carried into execution in his majesty's Dock Yards, we might in many instances be inclined to join with those who gave it the preference; but before the question was decided in its favour, it might have been proper to enquire to what extent the public service had suffered under the former system; what complaints had been preferred of the neglect of duty in the artificers, what means had been taken to prevent such misconduct; and, if the evil was found really to exist, whether it was or was not attributable to an inadequate rate of daily pay, and how far an increase thereof might have been expected to effect a cure; or, whether a total change of system was the only remedy that could be applied.&#x2014;Previous to introducing the new system, it ought first to have been laid down as a foundation, what, in the circumstances of the times, was a proper compensation for the full exertion of an artificer during such a number of hours as he could continue his daily labour with effect; and next, what quantity of work he was to perform to entitle him to the whole or to certain proportions of that compensation; or, in other words, a Table of Prices was to be settled fur all kinds of work in small divisions, in order that by this table of work and prices, the artificer
<col>1060</col>
might be paid, whether his labour was confined to the usual hours, or required for extra or additional time. Supposing the plan to be so far matured, the difficulties that might be found in carrying it into practice would then have claimed attention, and, by experience and due observance, it might have been determined whether the system, if generally introduced, would be likely to be beneficial to the public.&#x2014;In considering the practicability of working by the Piece, particularly in Job Work or Repairs, the circumstances which constitute the difference between the extensive and various concerns of his majesty's Yards and those of private builders, should have had their due weight. It might have been surmised, that it would be almost impossible to keep faithful and regular accounts of the various and minute works to be performed, and the prices to be allowed for them; that the expence of keeping such accounts would be great; and that diverting the time and attention of the officers from the inspection of the works carrying on, to the duties of the accountant branch, would be a serious inconvenience.&#x2014;Whatever opinions might have been formed by individual members of the Navy Board, from their own observation or reasonings upon the subject, it might have been worth while to have enquired, and to have made some trial, whether the old system might not have been pursued with advantage, after some alterations and corrections: but this course was not pursued; it seems to have been concluded, that little work was done, because more might be produced by greater encouragement; but whether that encouragement might not have been given without a change of system, appears not to have been originally considered.&#x2014;It was apparent, that the fixed rates of pay were insufficient; but no desire was shewn to have them increased by authority, and in a plain and direct way. The Daily Pay of the artificers, when first established in the seventeenth century, must have been very considerable for the times. The settled change in the expence and mode of living had reduced that pay below what was necessary for their support, and had taken away every objection to an increase, arising from an expectation of a return to the former state of things. When a rate of pay becomes insufficient from causes of a sudden and extraordinary nature, temporary means
<image src="S1V0003P0I0545"/>
<col>1061</col>
may be resorted to; but when the cause is permanent, temporising expedients, so far from being useful, generally end in conceding to importunity more than, if granted at a proper time, would have been gratefully received.&#x2014;When Job Work was introduced, the rate of working, or in other words the highest amount of pay to which the earnings of the men were allowed to extend, while they worked the common hours of the Yard, was confined to a single day and one tide in winter, or 2s. 8&#x00BD;d. and single day and two tides in summer, or 3s. 4d. As Job Work is said to have been intended as an employment actually by the piece, it must have been considered by the Navy Board, that if the men exerted themselves, and proper prices were set upon the work by the officers, their earnings would have been equal only to those rates of pay. On what principle, then, could the rate of working have been increased within the same hours, either in the winter or summer season, and afterwards made equal in both seasons, in winter and summer, when the number of hours for which the men could work in the first was less than they could work in the other.&#x2014;Previous to 1753, the Shipwrights were stinted in their earnings to 2s. 8&#x00BD;d. a day in winter, and to 3s. 4d. in summer; and the time of their being employed was the common hours of the Yard. In 1793, their stint of earnings, for winter and summer, was set at one and the same sum, namely, 4s. 2d. a day; and the time of their being employed was increased, by their being required to work their dinner time, by which an hour and a half additional labour was obtained. But the common hours of work in winter being fewer than those in summer, the pay should not have been made the same in both seasons.&#x2014;In 1794, the same stint of earnings was continued, namely, 4s. 2d. a day for winter and summer, and the additional hour and a hall's labour was no longer required. The hours for working were thereby brought back to the same state as before 1793; namely, the common hours of the Yard, and were of shorter duration in winter than in summer by one hour and a half. But the rate of working being made the same in both seasons, namely, 4s. 2d. a day, there was an increase in summer of 10d. a day, and in winter of 1s. 5d&#x00BD; a day beyond the stint set previous to 1793.&#x2014;The inconsistency of this application of the
<col>1062</col>
scheme of Job Work is manifest from these examples. For men working at the same prices for their Jobs, must have been considered as capable of earning, by the same exertions, as much in a less time as in a greater. In fact, they received the same pay; namely, the sum of 4s. 2d. a day during both seasons.&#x2014;It surely could only be made to appear, that the men earned their full stint in those unequal times of labour, by falsifying the accounts; or, as the officers were left to propose such prices as they might think fit, by their increasing the valuation of the different articles in the same proportion as the Navy Board increased the rate of working, or stint of earnings.&#x2014;The following circumstance, which we discovered in the course of our examination, warrants the surmise, that the officers, in setting the prices proposed for Job Work, had in view to make it appear that the men earned the rate of wages authorized, rather than to ascertain the actual value of the work.&#x2014;Dilliculties having occurred in currying on by task the works of his majesty's ship Antelope, of JO guns, lately built at Sheerness, the officers employed the shipwrights by Job on several articles, and made the usual propositions to the Navy board of the prices to be allowed. On a comparison of the expence attending the performance of the works by job, with the sums which would have been allowed if the same works had been performed by task, as reported to us by the Navy Board, it appears, that there has been an excess upon the articles which were performed by Job of nearly one-half beyond what they would have cost by Task, as the following Account will shew:

<p id="S1V0003P0-01809">By this Statement it appears, that the prices for performing by Job the Works contained, in the 24th article of the Scheme of Task, are 64l. 12s. per cent. higher than
<image src="S1V0003P0I0546"/>
<col>1063</col>
the Task prices.&#x2014;It was not until the year 1802, fourteen years after the introduction of Job Work, that a schedule of prices was established by the Navy Board. This schedule does not contain one-tenth part of the articles of Job Work, and the prices are very unequal, as it has been stated to us the men on some works can earn about 8s. a day, and on others only 3s. 4d.&#x2014;The manner in which the men were to work, and be paid, under the new system, was as inconsistent with a just notion of work by the piece as the regulations we have mentioned were imperfect; for although industry was to be called forth by making pay to depend upon exertion, yet the earnings of the men were limited, and the plan therefore bore a strong resemblance to the former one, of a fixed rate of pay by the day.&#x2014;The men were required to work a certain number of hours by the Job or Piece, without knowing the prices set on the different articles of work; and yet, let their exertions be ever so great, they could only receive a certain sum. Thus, if they were restricted in their earnings to two for one, or the amount of two single clays pay, they could only be set off that sum in the pay book, though, by the valuation set by the officers, they had done work to a greater amount.&#x2014;It is stated by one of the surveyors of the Navy, that it was intended the men should be informed of the prices by which they worked, and it was reasonable they should be so; but so far from this being the case at Plymouth, they were purposely kept in ignorance of them. Had the men been allowed to work what is termed unlimited Extra, that is, to earn as much as they could or chuse to do, by s Table of Prices within the usual working hours, and a careful account had been kept of the work actually performe!, it might have been of great use by way of experiment, and for the future regulation of the Prices; for the result would have shewn not only what the general earnings amounted to but bow much more Was gained upon some articles of work than upon others. But to apply the knowledge thus obtained, is reference to some rate of pay as a standard would be necessary.&#x2014;The limitation of the men's earnings seems to have had for its object, to contine them to a certain new rate of pay. It was in fact, when they were working two for one, doubling their fixer pay. It was so considered by the officers of Plymouth Yard, and completely rendered so by the manner in which the extra
<col>1064</col>
wages were set off on the general notes from the master shipwright to the Clerk of the Checque, without any regard to the turns they had earned.&#x2014;Although we think the general system of Job Work ill suited to the various and extensive concerns of his majesty's Yards, yet we do not mean to assert that all the abuses which have arisen out of it were necessary attendants upon it; or that more intelligence and attention might not have made the plan less defective, or have prevented many of the abuses. We have noticed evils of this description, evils not inherent to the system, in the following instances:&#x2014;Namely, in a combination of self-interest, which has been permitted to exist against the public in all the persons who were concerned in the accounts of Job Work:&#x2014;In the manner of making the accounts, which have in most instances been altogether fictitious as to the men employed, on the work, and the time in which it has been executed, and merely calculated to cover the pay at which the Navy Board had set their highest stint of earnings:&#x2014;In the allowance of different prices for similar works at different yards:&#x2014;In requiring more work at one Yard than at another, for the same money:&#x2014;In the extravagance of the. prices for some articles, in particular such as Stage Work, for which during the last war 300 per cent. above the present prices were allowed by the Surveyors of the Navy, and in some instances, twenty times the value:&#x2014;In paying the workmen for the extra time at a quadruple rate, compared with the established pay:&#x2014;In paying them for work supposed to be done in the extra time, when all the work performed exceeded only, in a small degree, that which they should have done in the ordinary hours of the Yard:&#x2014;In paying the old and infirm shipwrights employed in the mast, boat, top, and capstan-houses, without any regard to their earnings, the same rate of wages as the most efficient shipwrights employed at the Dockside, and in some instances even a higher rate:&#x2014;In requiring the officers to sign certificates of work having been done, before the men could be entitled to certain wages, when they had no rule for estimating the value of the work; and even after they had declared they could not be responsible for the certificates which they were so required to sign:&#x2014;Tn doubling the contract prices for the teams in all the Yards, without any application
<image src="S1V0003P0I0547"/>
<col>1065</col>
from the Contractors for that purpose;&#x2014; and, in paying the wages of the Yards, without previously examining the pay books with the notes or vouchers, or auditing the accounts afterwards. These Irregularities and Abuses, which we have thus shortly enumerated, were not necessarily attendant on the Job System; but there are other defects, which we fear are inseparably connected with it. In private concerns, where working by the piece is adopted, there is generally an individual or counteracting interest opposed to that of the workmen. The employer is concerned in observing that the prices be not too high, and that faithful accounts be taken of the work;&#x2014;but in the public service, there is no check except that which arises from a sense of duty in the Overseer; and although that sense of duty may be strongly impressed on the minds of the Officers placed in that situation, it will necessarily be discouraged by the opposition it will be sure to meet with from those whose profits it may attempt to depress; and as there is a general inclination in men to be liberal, if not profuse, when unrestrained by self-interest, we apprehend, unless the conduct of the Officers be attended to with scrupulous exactness, the sense of public duty will frequently be found to yield to other considerations. The system of fallacy generally introduced in the late war to increase the wages of the workmen, is a strong confirmation of this observation&#x2014;The establishing of proper prices for all the various articles of work, capable of being distinctly valued, is a matter of great difficulty, and after all, there are some articles and some employments in the Dock Yard, which will not admit of being so appreciated. Whatever be the extent to which the scheme of employing the workmen by Job may be carried, there must be still a considerable number of the men at day work, who will look for a rate of pay equal, or but little inferior, to what the others receive; the influence of Job Work will therefore tend to increase the rate of pay generally to all persons.&#x2014;Besides the difficulties in the regulation of prices, too many occur in keeping the vast number of accounts required to protect the public from fraud under this system; and from the unintentional errors to which the accounts taken of the work are exposed, from the manner in which they are taken, and the situation of the persons
<col>1066</col>
employed on that service, that we doubt whether with all the vigilance, that can reasonably be looked for in zealous Officers, such accounts can be expected as ought to be relied on. To the expences of this system must be added, that of an office in each Yard for arranging and drawing out the accounts, when collected from the inferior superintendents; and to the defects of it must be added, the necessity of the attention of the superior officers being diverted from the works carrying on, to the examination of these numerous accounts. When the workmen are employed afloat, particularly on board ships at Spithead, at the Nore, in Cawsand Bay, and Plymouth Sound, where they lie at a great distance from the Yards, considerable time must be lost by the Artificers in going to and from the ships:&#x2014;When at work on board ships in commission, they must be greatly retarded by the crows, who are employed at the same time in the general refitting and equipment:&#x2014;When remaining on board, they may in tempestuous weather be prevented from working for days together, owing to sickness, and the motion of the ships.&#x2014;In these instances, where exertion and dispatch are most requisite, the members of the Navy Board whom we examined, allow that it is difficult, and almost impracticable to pay the artificers fairly and equitably for their labour by Job; and that many of the articles of repairs in the different branches are so trifling, as to render it difficult to take account of them, and to estimate the value of the labour performed. Even when the shipwrights are employed on board ships in Dock, they must necessarily be frequently broken off, and changed from one work to another, so as to render the keeping of a faithful account of their earnings a very complicated business.&#x2014;The Senior Surveyor has stated that many of the trifling articles of repairs must be paid for by estimation of the time the men are employed upon them; and that he is of opinion, if a fair rate of daily pay was established, and dispatch was not particularly called for, it would be preferable to employ the artificers by the day, "as the work would be better put out of hand, and some ex pence would be saved by it." The dispatch so requisite in time of war, we are of opinion, may in general be obtained by employing a greater number of men, instead of resorting to job Work; and if it should be ob-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0548"/>
<col>1067</col>
jected, that by increasing the establishments of the Dock Yards, there might not at all times be sufficient employment for the men, we answer, it is only necessary to build more ships in the King's Yards, instead of building them by Contract, and which we conceive, under proper regulations, may be done with much advantage to the public service. Upon the whole, considering the various abuses which have prevailed in the Job System, and after making every allowance for what may be prevented in future by a vigilant superintendence, we are of opinion, that it will be advantageous to the publie service to return to the former plain and simple system of employing the workmen by the day, except in building new ships, and in carrying on great repairs, as originally directed by the Task Scheme.&#x2014;With a view to simplify the accounts which must necessarily be kept, we recommend that the allowances for lodging, in lieu of chips at present made to the workmen, be abolished:&#x2014;That adequate rates of pay be established for the different classes, after due attention paid to all the circumstances of the times, and the advantages enjoyed by the workmen of his majesty's Yards over those employed in private Yards, such as, their having constant work, their being attended by a Surgeon, and receiving pay when hurt in the service, until their recovery, and their being allowed a provision by superannuation when old and infirm, or rendered incapable by accident of earning a livelihood. The only disadvantage under which we apprehend the workmen in the Dock Yards labour, is, the delay in the payment of their wages, whereby many of them are compelled to raise money upon credit, for which they pay a considerable premium.&#x2014; To remedy this inconvenience, we are of opinion, their wages should be paid to them as frequently as may be found practicable, but not until the pay books have been examined and compared with the vouchers by which the wages of the workmen are set off.&#x2014;In order to establish a stimulus to the individual exertions of the workmen, and that due encouragement may be given to the diligent and skilful, we recommend that the shipwrights be divided into three classes, according to their several abilities, with such difference in their rates of pay as may create an excitement to emulation and exertion; and that the other workmen, with the exception of
<col>1068</col>
the ropemakers, be in like manner divided into classes, the number of which classes must depend on the number of workmen in each branch.&#x2014;Whenever it may be found necessary to employ the workmen beyond the usual hours of labour, we recommend that they be paid at certain rates per hour, such rates to bear a proportion, in an increased ratio, to the daily wages of the class to which they may belong, but not at a double rate, as has hitherto been the case.&#x2014;Connected with this subject is, the consideration of the time which the artificers are directed to work. If the public pay for work by the piece, and the prices be fairly set, it would appear upon a superficial view, that the more hours the men are employed the more the work is advanced, and thereby a great object obtained, without any additional expence. But it may be questioned whether it is a fact, that, for any considerable length of time, work is done in proportion to the time the men are in the yard, when that time much exceeds the common working hours. Men in general are only equal, for a continuance, to the exertion of a certain degree of strength; if that exertion is stretched too far, more is probably lost than gained. Add to this, the inconvenience arising from the desire of great earnings thus excited, and the discontent which follows disappointment, whenever ill-health, or other causes, stand in the way of its being any longer gratified.&#x2014;The great difference between the established rates of pay, and the authorized earnings of the workmen by Task or Job, we believe to have been a chief cause of the fallacy which has pervaded the Accounts, and of the Abuses which have consequently arisen. We therefore recommend, that adequate rates of pay be established for the different classes of workmen, even if it should be judged expedient to continue the system of employing them by the piece. The officers of the Yards will thereby have it in their power to do justice to such of the workmen as are employed by the Day, of which description there must always be some, without having recourse to subterfuge.&#x2014;During the last war, under the orders of the Navy Board, the officers had no alternative but to employ the men by Day Work, at inadequate rates of pay, or to double their wages by calling their employment Task or Job. We are of opinion, that the plan of building ships, or carrying on great repairs, agreeably to the Task
<image src="S1V0003P0I0549"/>
<col>1069</col>
Scheme, may be continued with advantage to the public, as the account of the work can be taken with facility and accuracy; but, as we have before observed, the scheme of prices for building the different classes of ships wants revision, the prices for the large ships being set too high, and for the small ships too low. We are also of opinion, that the best workmen should be selected for building ships by Task Work, as the practice has been heretofore, and that no restriction should be laid on the amount of their earnings, except as to the hours allowed for working. This will hold forth additional encouragement to the most efficient and deserving shipwrights.&#x2014;By the introduction of Job. Work, the wages of the workmen were doubled generally during the last war, and the Navy Board's Warrant of the 4th of April 1803, to pay the workmen according to their earnings at prices admitted to be too high, has again had the effect in Chatham Yard of increasing the pay of the shipwrights from 4s. 2d. to 6s. 7&#x00BD;d. for working the common hours, from daylight to dusk, and allowing them an hour and a half for Dinner. We are therefore of opinion, that the wages of the artificers should be limited, as they were during the late war, according to the extra they may be directed to work, until adequate rates of pay be established.&#x2014;We must not dismiss this subject without noticing, that the established rates of pay for the same classes of workmen, are, in many instances, different in different Yards. The pay of the scavelmen in Portsmouth and Plymouth Yards is 1s.6d. in the other Yards, 1s.3&#x00BD;d. and as the scavelmen, during the late war, were in general employed at the rate of two for one, the pay of those in Portsmouth and Plymouth Yards has been 6d. a day more than at the other Yards; whereas we apprehend, if any difference is made in the pay of the workmen, that it should be less at Portsmouth and Plymouth than in the River Yards.&#x2014;An inconvenience, which we observed at Plymouth, requires notice; several of the workmen reside on the opposite side of the water to the Dock Yard, and have to go in boats to and from their work; some a mile, and some two or three. Many evils arise from this circumstance; the labour of rowing must in some measure exhaust their strength, and diminish their ability for exertion during the working hours, and their attendance
<col>1070</col>
is rendered more uncertain. The men do not pass through the gates of the Yard, and greater facility is given to the embezzlement of stores. The obvious remedy for these mischiefs is, that the men employed should be required to live in dock, or in the neighbourhood, on the same side of the water; or, if it should be thought hard to oblige those to remove who have established their families on the other side, the regulation might be confined to those only who at present reside on the Plymouth side, and those who shall be taken into the service hereafter.&#x2014;The accounts, regulations, and instructions, to the officers of the Yard, when introduced in the seventeenth century, may have been and probably were, suitable to the then confined state of the navy.&#x2014;The necessity of revising the instructions, and digesting the immense mass of orders which have since been given to the officers of the Yards, was seen by the late Earl Howe, and by sir Charles Middleton, when they presided at the Admiralty and Navy Boards, and the latter had made some progress in so useful a work, when he quitted the Navy Board; but since that time the subject has not been adverted to. No steps have been taken towards forwarding the work; and it seems to have been laid aside, and wholly forgotten&#x2014;We are of opinion, that the instructions to the officers of the Yards are not full and sufficient to apprize them of their duties: we therefore recommend, that no time be lost in reviewing and new arranging them, as well as in revising and forming accounts suitable to the present very extended scale of the naval service, and in establishing a general system, by which the civil department of the navy may be conducted with order, regularity, and economy.&#x2014;We think it must be in vain to expect good management in such a department as the Navy Office, where the business is so complicated and extensive, unless the principles will apply themselves, and unless the members of the board are chosen for their fitness for the situation they are to fill. The accounts of the navy are final. They are not audited or examined.&#x2014;The necessity, therefore, of intelligence and application to business in the different members who constitute the Naval Boards, must be apparent. The observation is forced from us, by the examination of one of the Commissioners of the Navy, of many years standing, whom
<image src="S1V0003P0I0550"/>
<col>1071</col>
we found almost altogether a stranger to the business of that office.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01811">IT having been intimated by some of the members of the Navy Board, that the business of the other Yards, with respect to employing and paying the workmen, had been conducted with more regularity than at Plymouth, we judged it expedient to enquire into the practice of some other Yard, previous to making our Report.&#x2014; With this view we fixed upon Woolwich Yard, not only because it is under the immediate superintendence of the Navy Board, and visited in general, weekly, by the Junior Surveyor, and occasionally by the Deputy Comptroller, but also because it is a small Yard, to which ships very seldom resort for the purpose of refitting or occasional repairs; and it might therefore be reasonably expected, that the accounts would be kept with more correctness and precision than at the out-ports, where the works carried on are far more extensive, and of a more pressing and complex nature.&#x2014;Although the practice in this Yard has differed in some respects from that at Plymouth, we are concerned to state, that an equal if not a greater degree of fallacy has prevailed in the accounts; and that the workman who have been supposed to be employed by the Piece, at wages depending on their exertions, have been paid with as little regard to the real amount of their earnings as at Plymouth&#x2014;The duty of mustering the men does not appear to have been strictly attended to. The weather being rainy, the absence of the clerks, or their being busily employed, were assigned as reasons for the neglect of it occasionally. This is a duty of too much importance to be dispensed with upon such frivolous grounds.&#x2014;We learned that it had been usual for the Clerks of the Checque, previous to the appointment of the present officer, to take the fees generally paid by the workmen for the Quarterly Notes of the amount of their earnings, and that it had been a practice for the clerks to take Quarterly Fees or Douceurs from the workmen for not checquing them when
<col>1072</col>
absent, by which they not only received the established rate of wages, but also the full amount of the extra authorized by the Navy Board. It appears this Abuse has been carried to a greater extent here than at Plymouth; but that it was put a stop to by the regulations established in 1801. Much praise is due to the present Clerk of the Checque, for having declined receiving the fees for the Quarterly Notes immediately on his appointment in 1794; more especially, as he found the practice of receiving them had prevailed for some years. &#x2014;The Artificers of this Yard were employed during the late war by Task and Job, or Piece Work, but the greatest extent of earnings which they were at any period permitted to make by Job was two for one and two tides, making the pay of the shipwrights 5s. 6d. a day.&#x2014;From the commencement of the late war, the artificers and labourers, generally, have not been allowed less for their common day's labour than two for one, or double pay, but the same construction has not been put on the warrants of the Navy Board, directing the workmen to be employed extra beyond the two for one, as we found had been put on them by the officers of Plymouth Yard, the Woolwich officers conceiving that the artifiers were to perform work equal in value to the full amount of the wages they received; but although this construction was correct, still we do not find that the wages paid to the men were governed by the quantity and value of the work performed.&#x2014;When the shipwrights have been employed by Task, it has been usual for the master shipwright to give a note to the Clerk of the Checque, stating the names of the men, the work on which they were to be employed, the sums to be allowed, and the time of their commencing work; and when the Task has been finished, the note has been returned to the master shipwright, and a certificate given by him on the back of it, that the work has been performed in a workmanlike manner. This practice of making out the Document before-hand, it is stated, has been productive of considerable difficulty, and unnecessary trouble: We are therefore of opinion, that the notes to the Clerk of the Checque of the names of the men intended to be employed on Task Work (which are requisite in order to his complying with the orders of the board, that they shall be the first mustered) should be distinct and separate Do-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0551"/>
<col>1073</col>
cuments from the vouchers of the work performed, and the sums to be allowed.&#x2014; The work performed by the shipwrights by Job has been taken account of by the quartermen, and reported by them to the foremen, who arranged the different articles of work in rough accounts, and affixed such prices thereto as they judged proper, governing themselves, where precedents existed, by the prices which had been approved by the Navy Board; these rough accounts were delivered to the master shipwright, and after having undergone his correction, the propositions to the Navy Board were copied from them by the clerks in the master shipwright's office.&#x2014;When the propositions had either received the approbation of the Surveyors, or the prices had been corrected according to their direction, warrants were issued to the respective officers to pay the men accordingly; and it was the practice at this yard for the master shipwright to furnish the Clerk of the Checque with Job Notes, which were copies of the Propositions, but in which the corrections made by the Board were entered:&#x2014;These Job Notes have not of late years been furnished regularly, nor have they contained the names of the persons by whom the sums stated in them were earned; but in some instances, the names of the quartermen, whose gangs were employed on the Jobs, have been inserted, and the number of days they worked; this information, however, was no guide to the Clerk of the Checque, as the periods between which the work had been performed were not noticed; it was therefore out of his power to set off to the men the specific sums they had earned. Indeed, that idea has been wholly lost sight of, it having been the practice, when the Job Notes for the shipwrights were received in the Clerk of the Checque's office, for the first clerk to bring their several Amounts into one total sum, in order to see whether the value of the work reported to have been performed would amount to the wages of the men employed by Job, at the rate of working authorized by the Navy Board.&#x2014;With this view, it was his practice, immediately after the expiration of a quarter, to make out an account of the number of shipwrights that had not been employed by Task, and to calculate the amount of their wages for the quarter at the rate of working so authorized; to which amount it was judged necessary, in order to justify the Clerk of the Checque
<col>1074</col>
in setting off the wages to the men at that rate, that Vouchers or Job Notes should be furnished to him by the master shipwright; and the amount of the wages was communicated to the officers employed in making out the Job Notes, that notes to that amount might be furnished.&#x2014;Notwithstanding this communication, it appears, by the evidence of the first clerk to the Clerk of the Checque, that the Job Notes were not furnished regularly, that is, to the amount of the sum required to give the men the rate of earnings directed by the Navy Board; and that, however short of that sum the Job Notes or Vouchers might be, the men, industrious or idle, were equally set off their wages at the full rate authorized by the Navy Board: it is stated that, in some instances, the Job Notes furnished to the Clerk of the Checque did not amount to half the sum of the wages set off to the men.&#x2014;The only calculation of the nature above described, which had been preserved, was for Michaelmas quarter 1801, by which the waives of the men, not employed on Task Work, amounted to 3,289l. 2s. 5d. for that quarter; and by a notation on the paper, it appeared, that the amount of the Job Notes furnished to the Clerk of the Checque at the time of setting off the wages to the men, was only 837l.&#x2014;From this practice, the shipwrights of Woolwich Yard employed by Job during the whole of the last war, were paid a certain rate of pay per day, varying according to the rates of working authorized by the Navy Board, without any regard whatever to the value of the work performed; and the supposed stimulus to exertion, namely, that the earnings depended upon it, urged so strongly by the Navy Board as the great advantage of Job Work, has not existed:&#x2014;The only stimulus in fact produced by thus nominally employing the workmen by Job, has been that of increased wages; and if such increase of wages has really had the effect of calling forth the best exertions of the people, which is not doubted by the Navy Board, though ascribed by them to their mode of employment, we are decidedly of opinion, that the exertions of the workmen will be equally secured by the mode we have proposed, of giving them fair and adequate rates of daily pay, and classing them according to their skill and abilities.&#x2014;When the Artificers of Woolwich Yard were directed to work extra, in addition to two for one, it appears
<image src="S1V0003P0I0552"/>
<col>1075</col>
the officers did not always require them to remain in the Yard beyond the working hours, the time necessary to entitle them to the extra:&#x2014;In the summer they have done so; but in the winter, it is stated they have been allowed two for one, and two tides, or 5s. 6d. a day, For working only from bell-ringing to bell-ringing, that is, from daylight in the morning to dusk in the evening; and as they have been paid the full rate of extra authorized by the Navy Board, without any regard to their earnings, the Abuse in respect to the extra has been carried to a greater extent at Woolwich than at Plymouth. A very striking instance of this abuse occurred in the repair of his majesty's ship, Amaranthe, of 24 guns, carried on by job at Woolwich Yard: the Board of Admiralty had lately been prosecuting an enquiry into the circumstances of this transaction, and their proceedings were laid before us. This ship was one of the prizes captured from the Dutch in the Texel during the late war, by the squadron under the command of sir Andrew Mitchell; and having been surveyed by the officers of Chatham Yard, and reported eligible for his majesty's service, was purchased of the captors at the rate of 4l. 10s. per ton, amounting to 2,241l. for her hull, her furniture and stores being valued separately. After the purchase, she was ordered to Woolwich to be repaired, and put in a state for sea service.&#x2014; The Amaranthe was taken into Dock at Woolwich in the month of May 1800, and was put out of Dock in the month of October 1801; when, not being wanted for sea service, she remained in ordinary at that port until the commencement of the present hostilities.&#x2014;She was commissioned on the 19th of March 1803, by Captain Boys. On the 10th of December 1803. he made a report to Vies Admiral Patton, the Senior Officer in the Downs, (which was transmitted by him to the Lords of the Admiralty,) that on clearing the bread room to stop a leak near the stern post, the Carpenter had reported, that the ship was not fit to ride at an anchor in her then state, as, on examination, it appeared to him that the copper was the only security to prevent the water from flowing into the ship; and that the Carpenter of the Flag Ship in the Downs, who had been required by Captain Boys to examine her, had reported her state to be still more alarming. Upon receipt of this letter, the Lords of the Admiralty
<col>1076</col>
ordered the ship to Sheerness, that she might be surveyed by the Shipwright Officers of that Yard; and called upon the Navy Board to state to them the expence which had attended her last repair:&#x2014;The expence for the Hull only was reported by that board to have been,

<p id="S1V0003P0-01812">In consequence of the report made by the Officers of Sheerness Yard of the state of the Amaranthe, and of the necessity for her being taken into Dock to have her defects made good, she was ordered to Deptford, where it was judged advisable to pay her off. We feel it our duly to state, that the repairs of this ship appear to have been conducted in a very improper and negligent manner; and that the expence attending them has been extravagantly great. By the evidence of Mr. Knowles, assistant to the Master Shipwright of Woolwich Yard, under whose immediate superintendence, the repair of the Amaranthe was commenced, and carried on for a considerable time, it will appear, that the usual precaution of surveying the ship, previous to the work being undertaken was omitted; that she was not open for inspection; and that in the course of carrying on her repair, none of the plank of her bottom was taken out to view the state of the timbers, although it is a general practice to remove some of the plank for this purpose. Mr. Knowles states, that Mr. Tovery, who was then Master Shipwright, but since deceased superintended the repair of the ship himself, and would not allow the Assistant to exercise his discretion in any point; and that the very necessary precautions before stated were omitted by the express directions of the Master Shipwright. The works performed to the Amaranthe consisted chiefly of new topsides and decks, and fitting the store rooms and magazine, after the manner of English men of war; not a single timber was shifted, and the ship was put out of hand with new topsides and decks, and a rotten bottom. As the Master Shipwright was deceased, we had no means of becoming acquainted with the reasons which could have induced him, in the instance of the Amaranthe, to depart, so injuriously to the public, from the established practice of the service; but we
<image src="S1V0003P0I0553"/>
<col>1077</col>
apprehend that some blame must be imputed to the Surveyor of the Navy; under whose general superintendence this work was carried on. We conceive it was his duty to have prevented the useless expenditure of so large a sum of money upon an old ship; which would have been done if the usual precaution of surveying her had been observed before the repairs were undertaken. The sums reported to us by the Officers to have been expended in the repairs of this ship, and in furnishing her with stores necessary to equip her for sea service, areas follows:

<p id="S1V0003P0-01814">The sum of eight thousand two hundred and seventy-three pounds, charged as the expence of materials and wormanship in the repair of this ship, amounts to the sum of sixteen pounds twelve shillings and two pence per ton, for which, or a less sum, it is stated, a new ship similar to the Amaranthe might have been built;&#x2014;On referring to the Task Scheme, we find, that the sum allowed for Shipwrights' labour in building a twenty-eight gun ship
<col>1078</col>
is two pounds seven shillings and sixpence a ton, (no provision being made for a twenty-four gun ship,) and the sum allowed for building a first rate is three pounds one shilling a ton; whereas the expence of Shipwrights' labour alone, in the repairs of the Amaranthe, amounted to six pounds five shillings and two pence farthing per ton, more than double the price fixed for building a first rate. The sum charged for the repair of this ship is allowed by the professional officers, and must appear to every one, to be enormous; the Master Shipwright is of opinion, that as not a single timber was shifted, the expence ought to have been very much below the sum charged; and that from the best information he has been able to obtain, the real value of the workmanship performed by the Shipwrights in her repair is not more than five hundred and twenty-two pounds twelve shillings and sixpence.&#x2014;Mr. Knowles, the Assistant, who superintended her repair for the greater part of the time, is of opinion, taking into consideration the expence of removing the old works, that the labour of the Shipwrights ought not to have amounted to more than three fourths of the sum allowed by the Task Scheme for building a similar ship, taking the price at a mean of the sums allowed for a twenty-eight and a twenty-gun ship, or two pounds seven shillings and three pence a ton; so that by the estimate of the latter Officer, not formed upon recollection only, but after a consideration of the proposition, it appears that the sum of two thousand two hundred and thirty-four pounds eighteen shillings and a halfpenny has been overpaid to the Shipwrights alone. In the outset of the enquiry instituted by the Lords of the Admiralty, they required of the Navy Board the Job Notes given by the Master Shipwright to the Clerk of the Cheque, and the propositions made by the Officers to the Board, of the prices to be allowed for the different works, Of the former only three could be found at the Yard, and the latter were furnished, with the exception of one, which was at the time mislaid, but afterwards transmitted to us by the Navy Board, at our requisition. By the proposition it appears, that the value set by the Officers themselves upon the Shipwrights' work falls very short of the sum charged; the amount of the propositions is one thousand eight hundred and nineteen pounds eleven shillings and sixpence half-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0554"/>
<col>1079</col>
penny, but in one of them there is an error against the public of sixty-seven pounds seventeen shillings and fourpence halfpenny, from the total of one of the columns being erroneously carried forward; as, one hundred and forty-eight pounds one shilling and a penny, instead of eighty pounds three shillings and eight pence halfpenny; whereby the correct amount of the proposition is reduced to the sum of one thousand seven hundred and fifty-one pounds fourteen shillings and two pence;&#x2014;but to that should be added the sum of fifty pounds five shillings, the amount of a note given to the Clerk of the Checque for coppering her bottom, the price for which having been fixed by the Navy Board, it was not referred to them. Thus, the whole amount of the Shipwright's work performed on the Amaranthe, when under repair in Woolwich Yard, between May 1800 and October 1801, as valued by the Officers at the time, is one thousand eight hundred and one pounds nineteen shillings and two pence; and although the sum is nearly double what ought to have been paid by the established scheme for task work for building a ship similar to the Amaranthe, yet it is little more than half the sum charged. This very extraordinary excess of expence can only be accounted for by the Shipwrights having been paid at the full rate authorised by the Navy Board, without any regard to the sums actually earned by them, according to the work performed. With a view to ascertain to what extent the money so paid for the repairs of the Amaranthe had been lost to the public, we wrote to the Lords of the Admiralty to give directions for her being surveyed, and to cause us to be furnished with a detailed estimate of the sum that would be necessary to put her hull into a state for service. By the report of the Officers of Deptford Yard, it will be seen, that she was in so general a state of decay, except her decks and topsides, that they judged it would be more advantageous to the public to take her to pieces than to repair her; but, from the best opinion they could form of the sum necessary to put her into a state for sea service, they reported that she could not but be estimated to be in want of a great repair, which it would require the sum of eight thousand pounds to perform, exclusive of copper fastenings, and the coppering of her bottom. In considering the sum lost to the public by the
<col>1080</col>
improvidence and neglect of those to whom its interests were considered, in the instance of the repair of the Amaranthe, the estimate must not be confined to the sum of eight thousand three hundred and thirty-nine pounds, actually expended in repair: &#x2014;but as a considerable part of the rigging and stores, by their appropriation to that ship, will only be applicable to inferior purposes, although in use so short a time, some part of the expence of four thousand and seven hundred and thirty-one pounds, incurred on that account, may be added to the loss resulting from her repairs.&#x2014;This is another instance of the loss which the public has suffered from that inattention and profusion, which, we fear, has in some degree pervaded the whole system. On the 1st of July 1803, the artificers of Woolwich Yard were directed to be employed as much extra as possible, and to be paid according to the actual amount of their earnings, without any restriction. The Officers did not attempt to keep the earnings of the several gangs employed by Job distinct, but, agreeably to their former practice, brought the various sums earned in the quarter into one total, and divided it equally among the whole number. Although the practice of dividing the earnings of the different classes of the workmen by Job equally among them, instead of paying the several gangs or companies according to their respective earnings, may have been the means of preventing delay in the payment of the Yard, yet it has in a great measure destroyed the stimulus to individual exertion, which the measure appears to have been intended to produce? and we apprehend, so long as the idle and inefficient are paid the same wages as the able and industrious, the exertions of the workmen never can be fully called forth. The joiners of Woolwich Yard, during the late war, were generally employed by Task and Job. Prices were fixed by the Navy Board for the works performed by Task, but no prices were fixed for any of the works performed by Job; nor did the officers propose the Jobs to the Board, as was the practice at Plymouth Yard: but notes were given by the Master Shipwright to the Clerk of the Checque, on the authority of which, the men employed by Job were set off at the full rate of wages authorized by the Navy Board. These notes contained the names of the men; the nature of the work on which they had been em
<image src="S1V0003P0I0555"/>
<col>1081</col>
ployed; and a certain number of single days, which was so calculated as to give the men, for the time they were employed, the full rate of earnings authorized by the Board;&#x2014;for instance, if two men had been employed on board a ship two days, and the rate of working authorized at the time was two for one, it was stated on the note that the men had been employed four single days each; but as the periods between which the works had been performed were not stated in the notes, the Clerk to the Clerk of the Checque, who set off their wages, was obliged to have the assistance of the Foreman of the Joiners, and to rely on his word for the times when the Jobs were commenced and finished. The house carpenters and bricklayers of Woolwich Yard were not restrained by the Navy Board in the amount of their earnings during the late war; but the masters in those branches have, notwithstanding, fixed certain rates of wages, which they judged the men entitled to, in the summer and winter months; and, when the value of the work performed has not been equal to the rates which they have fixed, they have falsified the accounts, by adding works that have not been performed, in order to bring it to that amount. The work performed by the house carpenters during the late war; was in general taken account of quarterly by the Master Shipwright's Measurer, accompanied by the Master House Carpenter, who pointed out the work which had been performed in the course of the quarter; but a considerable part of the house carpenter's work has of late years consisted in driving piles, and laying the foundation of a new wharf; and most of this work being buried, could only be taken account of at the time of its being performed; the Measurer has therefore been under the necessity of entering it in his books from accounts rendered to him by the Master House Carpenter. In the course of carrying on this work, it has frequently happened, that much of the men's time has been taken up in baling out water, to enable them to come at their work, and that the work has frequently been destroyed by the explosion of the dams. As the men have been employed wholly by the piece, the officers have had no other means of requiting them for the time so lost, but by falsifying the accounts; and, in consequence, when their earnings by the actual account have fallen short of the rates judged proper by the Master
<col>1082</col>
House Carpenter, which have been two for one, and two or three tides, or 4s. 8d. or 5s. 2d. a day in summer, and two for one, and one tide, or 4s. a day in winter; they have been constantly in the practice of entering works which have not been performed, in order to make up the account to that amount. In order that the Task notes, or documents furnished to the Clerk of the Checque, might amount as nearly as possible to the wages fixed by the Master House Carpenter, it was his practice to keep an account of the exact number of days each man worked in the quarter, and to calculate from it what ought to be the amount of the note, to give the men the rate of wages he had fixed, which he communicated to the Measurer, and by which the quantities of work inserted in the notes as performed, were in general governed. The same practice has obtained with respect to the bricklayers work, only that it has been in general measured and accounted for by the Master Bricklayer:&#x2014;the rates to which he has generally limited the earnings of the bricklayers, have been two for one, and two tides, or 4s. 8d. a day in summer? and two for one, or 3s. 8d. a day in winter, but sometimes more. This mode of proceeding cannot be considered in any other light than an increase of the daily pay of the workmen; but instead of the Navy Board having decided this important question, namely, what would be a proper rate of wages, the decision upon it has been left totally to the discretion of the Master Workmen whose pay and emoluments, prior to the regulations of 1801, depended upon the amount of the wages which they might give to the workmen employed under them. The result of our enquiry at Woolwich has not led us to change our opinion as to the inexpediency of the Job Work system; on the contrary, it has confirmed our belief, that even under a superintendence the most attentive and vigilant, that system would always be the source of abuse and fraud; and that there are such defects in the scheme itself, and such difficulties in carrying it into practice, that the extensive application of it to the general works of his Majesty's Dock Yards, cannot, under any regulations, be beneficial to the public. Since our return from Plymouth, we have learnt, that many of the abuses which we have mentioned in our report, particularly as to the falsification of the Job Accounts, and payment of the workmen, had been noticed about four
<image src="S1V0003P0I0556"/>

years ago by the Inspector General of Naval Works, in observations which he had drawn up on the subject of the Dock Yards. These observations have been laid before us, and we find in them a confirmation of the judgment which we have formed, as to the necessity of abolishing the present system of employing and paying the workmen by Job. We conceive a conclusion as to the mode of conducting the business of the other Dock Yards, may be drawn from the practice at Plymouth and Wool wich. We have certainly no reason for believing, from the circumstances which have come to our knowledge, that a different system, or better management, has prevailed at the other Yards, than at those which we have visited.

<title>NAVAL HOSPITAL AT EAST STONEHOUSE.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01818">HAVING finished our Enquiries at the Dock Yard at Plymouth, we proceeded to the Royal Hospital at East Storehouse, to examine the state and internal &#x0153;conomy of it, and to enquire into the nature of some Abuses, which had been, stated to
<col>1084</col>
exist, by one of the Commissioners of the Board for Sick and Wounded Seamen, to whom the inspection of the naval Hospitals and medical Establishments had been individually allotted; the former practice of visiting them occasionally and indiscriminately by the members of the Board, having been lately abolished.&#x2014; This Hospital was first opened for the reception of patients, about the year 1760; originally, the administration of its affairs was committed to a council, consisting of the physician, surgeon, steward, and agent.&#x2014;It was thought expedient in 1795, that a Governor and three lieutenants should be added to the establishment. In the following year, the council was abolished by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, and all matters not relating to the medical and chirurgical treatment of patients, were placed under the general superintendence and control of the Governor, with the three lieutenants to assist him in the discharge of his duty. The governor acts, in general, under the directions of the commissioners of the Sick and Wounded, but at times corresponds with, and receives orders from, the Admiralty, by whom the principal officers are appointed.&#x2014;The receipt and delivery of stores and provisions, the payment of tradesmen's and workmen's bills, and all money transactions, belong to the department of the steward and agent, subject to the inspection and approval of the Governor.&#x2014; The principal objects to which our enquiry in this Hospital has been directed, come under the Heads of Stores, Provisions, Medicines and Necessaries, Labourers, and Repairs.</p>

<title>STORES.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01819">Under this head are comprehended beding, dresses for the sick, and all articles of furniture for the use of the hospital. These, as they are wanted, the steward and agent apply for by letter to the governor, which he transmits to the * Board, and, if the demand is approved of, a supply is sent from London, or ordered to be purchased on the spot. Some very inconsiderable articles, not properly coming under the denomination of stores, are bought by the steward without previous application to the Board.&#x2014;When supplies have been required, it has not been usual to</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01820">* <i>When</i> the Board <i>is mentioned in this Report, without further designation, it applies to the</i> Sick and Wounded Board.</p>
<image src="S1V0003P0I0557"/>
<col>1085</col>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01821">examine and state the remains at the time of making the demand, which, we think, should always be done, that the Board may be enabled to judge of the necessity of them.&#x2014;It was formerly the Custom for only one of the junior clerks in the steward's office to attend the receipt of stores, of which an account was copied for the agent from the steward's book; within the last year, the steward or agent, with one of the lieutenants, has inspected inequality and quantity of all stores received, and the account has been taken by the steward or agent in whose charge they are kept; whilst this regulation is observed, nothing further seems necessary for securing the proper receipt of stores.&#x2014;If we are to form an opinion of the general attention formerly paid to the stores in this hospital, from the following description of the condition in which they were found, on the survey made in May 1803, we cannot judge of it too unfavourably: After enumerating the several articles in the account, the following is subjoined:</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01822">"All which stores are in the state and condition as expressed against each article in the margin, and we have left the same in charge of Meffrs. George Cleather and Richard Beddek, steward and agent of the said hospital; and we are of opinion, that the damage and great waste of stores has been occasioned through want of method and regularity in the Arrangement of them, various articles of all description being thrown together; new with old, clean with foul, dump with dry; wood, iron, linen, and woollen, all mixed in the greatest state of disorder and confusion; and with respect to the state of the cellars, store-rooms, wards, and garrets, in which the stores have been kept, was in a most shameful condition; the cellars very damp, and the bale goods placed in them have suffered very much from it; and we do declare, that we have taken this survey with such minute care and equity, that, if required, we are ready to make oath to the impartiality of our proceedings. Given under our hands, in the Royal Naval Hospital at Plymouth, the 1st day of June 1803. (Signed) <i>Ja. Murray. Tho. Huch. Winter. Geo. Tremlett."</i></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01823">This survey was made by three divisional masters, superintending the ships is ordi-
<col>1086</col>
nary at this port, by order of the Admiralty, upon a representation made by the inspector of the condition in which he had found the stores of this hospital.&#x2014;The late steward, who was dismissed soon after the survey, states, in his letter of vindication to the Governor, the difficulties which lay in the way of a proper diposition of the stores at the conclusion of the war, owing to a great quantity from ships and prisons having been suddenly returned into the hospital in a bad state, as well as to the defect of one of the wards used as a store room, and the reduction of clerks in his and the agent's office.&#x2014;If such was the state of things, it ought to have been made the subject of enquiry, and if not remediable by the Governor by means in his own power, the circumstances should have been immediately reported to the Board; for, until such representations are made, the charge of neglect and consequent responsibility must attach on the persons who are entrusted with the custody of stores, or whose duty it is to superintend the care of them.&#x2014;Proper arrangements have lately been made for the care and preservation of the stores, and they are subjected to frequent visitations. It might tend to a more regular observance of this duty, if the time of each visitation was minuted in the book of proceedings kept by the Governor, with the names of the Governor or lieutenants making the visits; with any remarks that should from time to time occur.&#x2014;By the records of the office it appears, that formerly balances were struck at various times, and reported to the Board; but that between the 30th of June 1778, and the 21st of Aug. 1794, a period of 16 years, the remains of stores were not ascertained: an inventory was then taken on the appointment of Mr. Cleather, the late steward, and no other account was either made out or called for by the Board, until Sept. 1802; without great inattention, both On the part of the commissioners of Sick and Wounded, and of the officers of the hospital, this neglect could not have happened. A survey only on the change of storekeepers can be of little use, if the accounts are not regularly kept up, and thee balances attended to.&#x2014; We would recommend that a general account of the balance of stores brought forward, and of the receipts, expenditure, and remains, should be made up, and transmitted to the Board every 6 months; if the state of the stores be constantly inspected,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0558"/>
<col>1087</col>
an actual survey need only to take place at more distant intervals; one or two years, unless any particular circumstances should call for it at an earlier period.&#x2014;Great negligence has prevailed in the issue of stores to the wards, opened by application from the physicians or surgeons to the stewards' office, for the reception of patients; this business has been entrusted to a labourer, who thus has uncontrouled access to every species of stores with which the hospital is furnished, and makes a verbal report of the articles issued to the otlice;&#x2014;this is improper; the steward, agent, or one of their clerks, should always attend the issues of stores, by whom a regular account of the articles should be taken, and a copy delivered to the person having special care of the ward.&#x2014;A practice had subsisted many years, of permitting to all persons on the establishment, whether residents in the hospital or otherwise, the use of linen, turnery wares, and other articles the property of the public, in which, however, the Governor and some others have not participated. No account was kept of the articles supplied to the officers: The issues to other persons were entered in the ward inventories, and when the articles in use became no longer serviceable, they were exchanged for others. The Governor states, that when this practice reached his knowledge, he ordered it to be discontinued; it was however found to subsist till finally stopped by the inspector. Attention should pe paid to prevent a recurrence of this abuse.&#x2014; Due care being had to the preservation of the different stores, those that become unserviceable should be laid aside, to be surveyed at the end of every 6 months, that such as shall be condemned may, under the direction of the Board, be forthwith sold.&#x2014;The unserviceable stores being removed, the store rooms will be less encumbered, and the Board will rely with confidence on the serviceable state of the several articles remaining on the account.&#x2014;We think the servants of the public are bound to communicate to the Boards under which they respectively act, whatever information in their departments may appear to them useful to the service, although there be no precise order to that point in their instructions.&#x2014;In conformity to this principle, the officers of this hospital should have apprized the Board of the quantity of hair, which, by the return of old bedding from Mill Prison at the conclusion of the war, had increased
<col>1088</col>
to the amount of 11 tons (of which an accumulation of nearly half that quantity had previously taken place) in order that this expensive article might have been distributed to other places where a supply was wanting.&#x2014;The cost of hair purchased for the several medical establishments under this board, from 1794 to 1803, according to an account laid before us, amounted to 32,743l. 5s. 8d.&#x2014;In what manner this article should be disposed of at the return of peace, it may be proper then to take into consideration: the empty wards will afford a secure depository.&#x2014;A want of specific directions was stated to us in another instance, where a sense of propriety seemed all that was required. Boxes of nitre and vitriolic acid, of which parts had been used instead of being completed from each other, were sent to a druggist's at Plymouth to be filled up, even without an account being previously taken of the quantity remaining in them.&#x2014;Stores belonging to ships have distinctive marks, but no marks are put upon those of the Hospital, which, we think, to prevent embezzlement, should be done in all cases where it is practicable.</p>

<section>
<title>PROVISIONS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01824">Since the appointment of a Governor and lieutenants, the steward and agent alternately, with one of the lieutenants, have attended to inspect the quality of the provisions, which have also been weighed in their presence. If any part has been found not equal to contract, it has been reported to the Governor, and rejected. If this inspection were extended, as the governor's instructions direct, to the cutting up of the meat, Abuses in this part of the business would be effectually shut out.&#x2014;The quality of the beer is stated to have been frequently complained of, and returned by order of the Governor; and the extravagant use of porter in this Hospital is attributed to that cause. It is to be regretted, that the remedy provided in the contract had not been resorted to, and sound beer procured, and the difference in price, if any, charged to the contractor, at any rate, it ought to have been represented to the Board.&#x2014;By a letter from the inspector to the Admiralty, it appears, that 4,000 gallons of porter were expended in this Hospital in six months, whereas the expence at Haslar had not in any one of the last five years exceeded 1,828 gallons; and in the year 1801, it was only 764 gal-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0559"/>
<col>1089</col>
lons. A careful inspection of the accounts in the office in London, would have earlier brought into notice the difference in the expenditure of this article at the two Hospitals.&#x2014;Under the head of provisions is included, in the Hospital accounts, the article of coals. The probable consumption for every year is stated by the steward and agent to the governor; who, by direction of the Board, advertises for proposals, and enters into a contract with the person making the lowest tender. The coals are landed at a quay on the west side of Stonehouse Bridge.&#x2014; Disputes have frequently arisen between the Meter and Receiving Clerks, as to the proper measurement of coals; the Meter and the Contractor have one common interest, as the profits of both are affected by the quantity measured. These disputes, by which there is reason to believe the public has suffered, should not have been permitted to continue so long without a decision: after a full investigation of the complaint, and in failure of redress by reference to the superior Officer of the Customs at Plymouth, the case should have been represented by the Governor to the Board. By the Act 12th Anne, c. 17, it is directed, that the bushel should be heaped as much as it will bear; a strict attention to this rule should be enforced, and care taken that the number of sacks filled from the ship, are actually received at the Hospital; a point to which no attention has hitherto been paid. In order to check the receipts, by the quantity expressed in the cocket from Newcastle or Sunderland. &amp;c. we recommend that whole cargoes be engaged for by the Board, and that an account be kept of the name of the ship, the Master, the quantity delivered, and also of that mentioned in the cocket; the quantity of coals used in the Hospital, will readily admit of the purchase of whole cargoes. We think it advisable, to prevent the suspicion of abuse, that the Officers should not, as at present, be supplied with coals from the ships delivering their cargoes to the Hospital. A certain allowance of coals is established for the use of the Officers, Wards, Kitchen, &amp;c. but in fact a quantity is daily and regularly charged to some, and occasionally to other officers, exceeding the actual issue, in order, as it is stated to us, to make the receipts and issues correspond. This practice as it is fallacious, and may be used to cover fraud, should upon no account be per-
<col>1090</col>
mitted. The expected deficiency this contrivance is intended to meet, is attributed to bad measurement in the receipt, and the waste and loss arising from issues in so many small quantities; the first cause will, we trust, immediately cease; and, if proper care be taken, we do not understand that much difference should accrue from the latter.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>MEDICINES AND NECESSARIES.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01825">Medicines were formerly supplied by the direction of the Board, on the demand of the dispenser; no accounts of the remains, or of the expenditure were stated, except in the case of the issues of Medicines to the Fleet. The necessity of the supply is now certified by a physician and surgeon, and a statement of the remains accompanies the demand. The dispenser examines the quality, and sometimes the quantity, whether sent from London or procured at Plymouth. This part of his duty should be carefully examined by him, or one of his Assistants, and the account, or bill of parcels, signed in proof of such examination. We recommend that, excepting in cases of sudden emergency, all medicines be supplied from London. The same neglect, as to accounts of remains, appears to have prevailed in this as in the Store department. From the time when the present Dispenser entered upon his office, eleven years ago, till June 1803, no survey was taken of the Medicines; it was then done by three Navy Surgeons, and should be regularly taken at proper intervals. The Dispenser has also the charge of Necessaries for the use of the sick, wine, porter, tea, sugar, cocoa, fruit, &amp;c. He is supposed to inspect the quality, and to ascertain the quantity of Necessaries received; but this has not always been done. No account was ever kept of the expenditure of fruit and eggs; of the other necessaries, a monthly statement is now sent to the board, audited by the Governor, one Physician, and one Surgeon. In the consumption of some articles of Necessaries, a considerable abuse has prevailed; wine, fruit, and eggs, have been expended in large quantities; though the two latter have, for several years, been considered as unnecessary at Haslar Hospital. It appears, that in consequence of a representation made in 1794, by the Commander of a squadron at Ply mouth, that fruit, and a greater quantity of wine than was usually administered,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0560"/>
<col>1091</col>
were wanting to assist in the recovery of the men belonging to the ships under his command, then in the Hospital; an allowance of fruit was made, and has continued from that time till prohibited by a late regulation. If the allowance was required only on a particular occasion, it should have ceased with the occasion; if it was proper to be granted at all times, the patients in the Royal Hospital at Portsmouth should have equally felt the benefit. In either case there was a neglect, which a proper examination and comparison of the account of both Hospitals would have prevented. How far the expence incurred under the head of Necessaries, may have been increased from the use of them by certain Officers of the Hospital, and their families, we cannot ascertain, but we feel no hesitation in declaring, the practice of drawing from the Dispensary, such articles as wine, cocoa, sugar, and others of common household consumption, was improper. As the limits to which this indulgence should be extended are not defined, and there is reason to believe it has been abused, we recommend that Necessaries be allowed to such persons only as may be patients within the walls of the Hospitals. Necessaries have been sometimes purchased for the Hospital, whilst there was in store similar articles returned from ships, which have afterwards become unserviceable from being too long kept. These Necessaries we were told, were not issued to the Dispenser, because they had been originally purchased for the use of ships, and it had not been the practice to convert to one service, articles which had been destined to another. In order, however, to prevent these losses to the public in future, we think, that in all such cases, articles likely to receive injury from being longer kept, should be appropriated to the use of the Hospital, and properly accounted for.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>LABOURERS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01826">The present establishment of Labourers is twenty, one attached to the Dispensary at 10s. 6d. per week, two others to the Office of the Steward and Agent, at 8s. 6d. and the rest employed in various services of the Hospital, at 5s. with provisions estimated at 5s. a week more, and a ward allotted for such of them as chuse to lodge in the Hospital, of which only four avail themselves. There is not at present any check established upon these servants of
<col>1092</col>
the Hospital, though provided for by the 40th art. of the Governor's instructions. They are not restricted from passing in and out of the gates at pleasure, or mulcted of their pay when absent. It appears to us proper they should be mustered by the Steward or Agent upon coining in, and, as they are victualled by the Hospital, there can be no reason for their going without the gales until they are discharged in the evening, when they should be again called over, and those absent without leave of the Governor, or, in his absence, of the Lieutenant of the day, should be checked of their day's pay. We understand that certain Officers of the Hospital have been in the practice of employing the Labourers on their private business; but at the time of our enquiry, this abuse was found to prevail in one instance only.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>REPAIRS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01827">A Surveyor has recently been appointed by the Navy Board, to superintend the repairs in the departments of the Navy, and Sick and Wounded Boards, in the Plymouth District, at a salary of 5s. a day, instead of charging specifically for every survey or estimate, which for work done in the Hospital had amounted, on an average, to 63l. per annum. In large undertakings, the Surveyor is always consulted before they are reported to the Board, but the necessity of small repairs is merely stated in a weekly letter to the Board, and, if approved, the Surveyor is generally acquainted therewith. The work is executed by tradesmen in the different branches holding contracts with the Board, to whom notice is given of the work to be performed. In trifling repairs, the Contractors are paid for the materials used, and for the time of the workmen at the contract price of labour per day. Large repairs are paid for by measurement; at the end of six months, the Surveyor measures all such works, and delivers an account of them at the Steward's Office; he also certifies the repairs done by day work. This part of his duty he has complied with, because the bills could not be paid without his signature, but he has done it with reluctance, being wholly dissatisfied with the irregular manner in which the account of the materials and workmen's time was kept, and has made frequent remonstrances on the subject to the officers of the Hospital. Formerly no check was established on the quantity or
<image src="S1V0003P0I0561"/>
<col>1093</col>
quality of the materials used, or men's time in performing small repairs, confidence being placed intirely on the accounts exhibited by the contractors. About eighteen months past, the Plumber of the Hospital was directed to superintend and controul these accounts.&#x2014;When the work is to be paid for by measurement, no particular time should be fixed for it, but it should be measured as soon as possible after the work shall be completed; and as the Surveyor resides near the Hospital, and visits it two or three times in each week, we think no repairs should be reported to the Board, or commenced, without his inspection.&#x2014;The workmen employed on small repairs, ought to be mustered upon coming to and leaving their work, and such muster compared with the charge made for labour in the Contractor's bill; and as the Plumber of the Hospital may occasionally be prevented from superintending the repairs by an attention to his own business, it might be proper that some proper person should be directed to perform this duty, and that he should take an account of all the materials used in the different branches, and deliver the same daily to the Agent's Office.&#x2014;We further recommend, that the accounts of all the Contractors for Repairs be settled for all such works as are finished, and the bills paid every 6 months, as at present directed; and that no contractor or tradesman be thereafter employed, who shall neglect to give in his account at the proper time.&#x2014; Information was conveyed to us of Frauds and Abuses committed by some of the Tradesmen employed to perform Repairs in the Hospital. We examined the persons pointed out to us as capable of substantiating the facts, but we think it right to state, that, notwithstanding the want of sufficient checks afforded abundant opportunities of Fraud, we are not warranted in making a charge of that nature from the evidence brought before us.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01828">Having noticed such circumstances as came under the proposed heads, we shall now proceed to make such general observations as have occurred to us, and to suggest such alterations as we think may tend to the better management of the affairs of the Hospital.&#x2014;It appears that the Butler and some other servants of the establishment, have been continued at full wages and allowance of provisions, with the indulgence of necessaries, whilst other persons were
<col>1094</col>
employed to perform the duties for which they were incapacitated by age and infirmities; the Butler in particular, who is charged with the issue of coals, bread, beer, and other material articles of consumption, has been for ten years incapable of service; we recommend that in future all such cases be immediately reported to the Board, that persons entitled by long and faithful services may enjoy the allowance provided for superanuated servants of the public, and their places be filled up by such as are efficient.&#x2014;Neither the Steward or Agent, at the time of our enquiry, had received their instructions from the Board, although one of them had been appointed six months and the other two, from which circumstance they were obliged to rely on their Clerks for information respecting their Duties. It appears to us necessary that all persons holding offices of trust, should be furnished with instructions for their conduct at the time of their appointment.&#x2014; In the notices which we have taken of the Stewards and Agent's Offices, in the course of this Report, we have considered and referred to them as at present constituted, having, in many instances, a conjoint trust and management. In some cases, however, their duties are distinct; and we are inclined to think it would be advantageous, on the ground of individual responsibility, that they should be separate in all; the Steward acting as Storekeeper, and the Agent taking and keeping such accounts, as may enable him to check the receipts and issues of all stores and provisions.&#x2014; We understand that evils have frequently arisen from the Physicians and Surgeons of Naval Hospitals pursuing private practice; an instance was indeed adduced to us of a patient in this Hospital who was about to have a limb amputated, being neglected in consequence of the Surgeon having been called away to attend a patient in the neighbourhood. Private practice in time of peace is authorized by the Governor's instructions; we think, however, that practising out pf the Hospital ought to be prohibited both in peace and war; but as we consider the present Salaries of the Physicians and Surgeons, as well as those of the Dispenser, Steward, and Agent, inadequate, we recommend their being increased, and that some addition be made to their permanent salaries in war time, on the principles which have been established respecting the salaries of the officers of the Dock Yards, to whom some
<image src="S1V0003P0I0562"/>
<col>1095</col>
Compensation is made for their increased trouble.&#x2014;The first Physician and first Surgeon, as well as the Steward and Agent, have houses allotted to them, but the Governor, Lieutenants, and the other medical officers, reside out of the Hospital. Though it were desirable that the Governor, particularly, should have a residence within the walls, yet we know not how to recommend the incurring of such an expence at present. In public buildings, a certain liberality in the structure is becoming, but it may be carried beyond the proper bounds. The houses erected for the Steward and Agent have coach-houses and stabling, and are otherwise out of proportion to the salaries of 1501. per annum annexed to those offices; not only has govt. been put to an unnecessary charge in the building, but the persons destined to inhabit these houses, may be tempted to support the expence which they give rise to, by means inconsistent with a faithful discharge of their duty.&#x2014;The appointment of one of the members of the Board exclusively to inspect the several medical establishments, we trust will be productive of much benefit; his enquiries should extend to every part of their order, &#x0153;conomy, and discipline; and we think it should be so expressed in his commission, to prevent doubts as to the extent of his authority; and that his reports should be made in writing to the Admiralty, and Sick and Wounded Board. Although it may be proper that Abuse should be immediately checked by the orders of the Inspector, new regulations should not be established but by the authority of the Board. The visits which the Inspector may make to the Hospital Establishments, should neither be at fixed times, or previously announced, that he may see every thing in its usual state.&#x2014;After being obliged to remark so many defects in the general management of the affairs of the Hospital, we had the satisfaction to learn from the Inspector, that all proper care and attention are exercised in the treatment of the patients.&#x2014; The advantage of comparing the expences of one establishment with another of a similar nature, or those of the same establishment at different periods, seems formerly to have been entirely overlooked; we are strongly impressed with the utility of such comparisons being made, and would recommend the practice on all proper occasions, and that the accounts be arranged and kept under different heads, so
<col>1096</col>
as to facilitate such comparisons; and we think it might be advantageous to keep a separate and distinct account of the expence of buildings, and of the cost of the ground on which they are erected.&#x2014;From the present mode of keeping the accounts of the Medical Department of the Navy, the labour of extracting and arranging statements of distinct articles of expenditure, occasionally required for the purpose we are now speaking of, is very considerable.&#x2014;Had the attention to place the expences incurred at Plymouth Hospital under their proper heads, been observed, we should not have had to notice, in an account of the expenditure of the Sick and Wounded Office from 1793 to 1801, so large a charge as 9,774l. 2s. 7d. out of 22,938l. 5s. 5d. for medicines during the late war, which when examined into appeared to have been paid for articles not properly coming under the description of medicines.&#x2014;Upon examining the chief Clerk in the Office for Foreign Accounts, we learned, that the business in the Sick and Wounded Office was very much in arrear; that many of the accounts of the late war, as well as of the former and present, are still unsettled, and that the establishment of Clerks has been at all times too small. These circumstances, though belonging to an office not within our purpose to have considered at present, otherwise than in its relation to the subject of this Report, being of such serious import to the public, induced us to obtain further information from the Chairman and another Commissioner, as well as the Secretary of that Board, by whom the very backward State of the Accounts is fully confirmed; and it will appear by the statement delivered to us by the Secretary, which is attached to his evidence, that Accounts to the amount of more than 2 millions sterling remain unsettled.&#x2014;The Commissioners of Enquiry, in their report on this Office in March 1788, notice the great Arrear of Accounts at that time, and very ably describe the losses to which the public is exposed by a procrastinated examination of accounts and vouchers. It does not, however, appear that the evil has been removed: we found occasion to offer an opinion on the same subject in our First Report, and conceive it to be our duty earnestly to recommend that extra Clerks be immediately engaged, and that some of those on the establishment best qualified for it, be exclusively employed in bringing
<image src="S1V0003P0I0563"/>
<col>1097</col>
up the Accounts in Arrear, laying aside for the present those of an ancient date, in order to examine those of a later period.&#x2014; However desirable it may be to reduce expensive establishments at the conclusion of ft war, we fear it cannot be done in the accountant branch, without much caution. as the Accounts of the winding up of a war, independant of those in arrear, will require some time after peace is concluded to examine and adjust.

<title>LE CATON HOSPITAL SHIP.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01830">IN the year 1796, a letter under a fictitious signature was sent to the Commissioners of Sick and Wounded Seamen, representing Abuses in the article of Provisions, on board Le Caton Hospital Ship at Plymouth. The Board took every means in their power to communicate with the writer, and the Purser of the ship was desired to lay before them any well-authenticated facts that came to his knowledge, but without success in either case. The same person, though he again addressed the board in 1798, did not make himself known, and the Purser being interested in the contract for victualling the sick, no information was given by him on the subject. In May 1803, a letter, of which the following is a copy, was addressed to the First Lord of the Admiralty, which he immediately transmitted to us, and we, in consequence, made such enquiry as the distance of time from the transaction would permit. "Modbury, Devon. May 21st, 1803. My lord, as Hospital Ships may again be appointed at the different ports, I beg leave (as I think it my duty) to communicate to your lordship some proceedings on board one of them during the late war. The Purser of the ship alluded to, was the Contractor with the Sick and Hurt Board for victualling, &amp;c. the Sick; a very <i>extravagant table was established</i> on board, the <i>expence</i> of which, he was given to understand, was to be defrayed out of the profits of the contract. He being an elderly man, was much alarmed in his situation, but was told it might be made not only a comfortable but profitable matter, and if
<col>1098</col>
he was inclined to relinquish it, the Surgeon's first Mate would take it off his hands, and allow the Purser (as Contractor) One Hundred Guineas per Annum, to be paid quarterly. On these terms, a strong indenture (a true copy of which, I believe, is now in my possession) was entered into and executed by the parties, and continued in force the whole time the ship remained an hospital ship for English sick. I now beg leave to subjoin the quarterly payments made to the farmer of the contract (several of which was made by myself) after having paid the heavy charges of the Baker, Brewer, Butcher, Milkman, &amp;c. (several of these payments I have also made) their respective quarterly bills. I am, my Lord, &amp;c. <i>Tho. Dawkins."</i></p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01832">By the evidence of the writer of this letter, and of the Surgeon's Mate of the ship, who was the Sub-Contractor, it appears that Mr. Samuel Keast the Purser, since deceased, on the 8th of Feb. 1794, entered into a Contract with the Sick and Wounded Board for victualling the Sick on board that ship; that, on the 1st of the following month, he made over the profits of the Contract to the Surgeon's first Mate of the said ship, on an agreement to be indemnified against loss, and to be paid 100 guineas each year, whilst the contract lasted; that the Surgeon was privy to the agreement, and received one half of the profits; and that a table was kept on board for the officers, furnished with wine and other articles by the tradesmen who supplied provisions for the Sick, and paid for out of the profits of the contract.&#x2014;In addition to the articles furnished for the officers table, it appears by the evidence of the Surgeon's Mate, who was the Sub-Con-

tractor, that articles of provisions and Madeira wine were obtained by the Purser for his private use from the tradesmen, and charged in the bills as supplied for the use of the sick. Since our return to town, we have been furnished by the Sick and Wounded Board, at our requisition, with a copy of the contract entered into with Mr. Keast, and other papers relating to that transaction. The contract is dated the 8th of Feb. 1794, and the price agreed for 1s. per man per day. Upon the application of the contractor, in May 1795, the Board increased the price to 1s. 4d. and on the 25th Oct. 1797, it was fixed at 1s. 3d. at which rate it continued till the termination of the contract in Jan. 1798. The following Statement will shew the amount paid to the Contractor in each year, by the Sick and Wounded Board, and the profits made by the persons concerned in the contract; viz.</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01834">Upon a consideration of the above account, it must be allowed, that the profits upon the contract, amounting to upwards of 62 per cent. exceed all reasonable bounds, and that the advance granted by the Sick and Wounded Board in May 1795, is not justified by the apparent necessity of the case, as, upon an average of the number victualled for the whole time, it appears the cost to the Contractor did not amount to more than 9d a man a day, and in the year 1794 to 7&#x00BC; only. It may be said, that the sums which we have stated as the total profits of the contract are incorrect, as some payments were made by the Sub Contractor, which are not deducted from the sums paid over to him by the original Contractor, but such payments
<col>1100</col>
are admitted by himself to have been of trifling amount, and we think are more than counterbalanced by the expence of keeping the table for the officers, and of the articles applied by the Purser to his private use. As it was the especial pro&#x2014; vince of the Surgeon and Surgeon's Mate to guard against the misconduct of the Contractor, and to take care that the patients should enjoy every advantage that medical skill and nourishment could afford; their conduct in abandoning this serious and important trust, and placing themselves in a situation where their interest was in constant conflict with their duty, appears in the highest degree censurable.&#x2014; The incitement of self-interest thus created might not only operate to the prejudice of the individuals falling under the care of these persons, but would also affect the interest of the public, as it held out an inducement to the Surgeon to retain patients longer on board the Hospital ship than might be necessary for the cure of their diseases, by which their services would be lost to the public.&#x2014; In order to prevent such evils in future, we recommend that all persons having any interest in contracts to be made with the public boards, should be named therein; and that all persons deriving any benefit from such contracts, not being named therein, should be subject to certain penalties; and further, that no contract or share thereof should be transferred, without the authority and approbation of the board with whom it was made, such authority and approbation, together with the assignment of the interest, to be noted on the back of the contract; and that all persons transferring any share or interest in any contract, without the authority and approbation of the public board, and without causing a notation thereof, and of the assignment, to be made on the back of the contract, should be liable to a penalty of 500l. And we further recommed, that a clause should be inserted in all such contracts, by which the public board should have power to declare the contract void, if any of the provisions before mentioned should be transgressed.&#x2014;The Commissioners for sick and wounded seamen, at the time of transmitting us the account of the sums paid to Mr. Keast, under the contract for victualling the sick on board Le Caton, informed us, that in making up such account it had been discovered, that the sum of 87l. 17s. 3d. had been over-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0565"/>
<col>1101</col>
paid to the Contractor on his account, between the 1st of Oct. 1797 and 31st Jan. 1798, from the inadvertence of one of their principal clerks, who is since dead; and by a subsequent explanation from the board it appears, that such over-payment arose from the order given by them in Oct. 1797, for reducing the allowance to the Contractor from 1s. 4d. to 1s. 3d. a day having been overlooked, and the payments consequently continued to be made at the former price of 1s. 4d.&#x2014;In our Report on the block and coopers contracts, we pointed out the Abuses and Errors to which the practice of increasing and reducing contracts is subject; the instance before us confirms our opinion, that an advance on the contract price should never be made, till after a full examination into all the circumstances, of the case, and a conviction that the advance proposed is necessary; and as we have before recommended, we think the alteration proposed, with circumstances leading to it, should be submitted to the Lords of the Admiralty for their consideration and determination.

<title>HIS MAJESTYS VICTUALLING DEPARTMENT AT PLYMOUTH.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01838">In the course of our Enquiries at Plymouth, we examined into several matters in the Victualling Department, and have to notice some Abuses and Irregularities which have prevailed therein. The business of this branch is for the most part carried on at the Victualling Office at Plymouth; but the Brewery, and principal part of the Cooperage, are carried on at Southdown, about 4 or 5 miles from Plymouth on the West side of Hamoaze. We shall arrange our Report on this Department under the following heads: 1st, Employ and Pay of Coopers. 2d, Receipt, Issue, and Account of Provisions and Stores in general. 3d, Receipt and Management of Coals. 4. Sale of Old Stores.</p>
</section>
<section>
<title>EMPLOY AND PAY OF COOPERS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01839">The Coopers are employed either by the day or piece-work. The numbers borne at the time of our Enquiry were as follows: At Plymouth, 11 working by the day, called Day-Coopers; 8 working by the piece, called Block-Coopers; and at Southdown 6 Day-Coopers and 44 Block Coopers. The established rate of pay for the Day-Coopers is 2s. 6d. a day, and 6 pence an hour for extra time. The Block-Coopers can earn, upon an average, about 7s. 6d. a day. It is obvious, that either the wages by the day are too low, or the prices of piece work, by which so much more may be earned, are set too high. The prices of piece-work were revised in Jan. 1803, but the Master-Cooper at Southdown was not consulted on the occasion. In his opinion, the prices then settled are not fair and equal; the work upon some articles being much more profitable than upon others. We understand that upon some Jobs, such as repairs called Trimming, 12s. a day may be earned, while upon others, no more than six or seven shillings a day can be earned, though the same degree of skill be required, and equal diligence be exerted in both cases: The consequence is, that those to whom the less profitable Jobs are allotted become dissatisfied with their Officers, and jealousies and cabals arise among them which are injurious to the service, and there is reason to believe that this circumstance has sometimes been the cause of their making unfounded charges against their Officers. It follows, that the prices should again be revised, and
<image src="S1V0003P0I0566"/>
<col>1103</col>
more equally apportioned, or that some articles of the work, to which it may be found impossible to set fair and equitable prices, should be no longer performed by the Block Coopers who work by the piece, but by the Day Coopers. We apprehend that the repairing or trimming of casks is an article of this description. According to the present scheme of prices, the same sum is allowed for repairing or trimming a cask, whether it requires much or little repair, or merely to have the head taken out for the purpose of being cleaned and aired. This holds out to the person employed a temptation to get rid of a job which will detain him long, and his interest leads him to lay aside casks wanting much repair (which is easily managed by wilfully rendering them unserviceable) that he may go on with others to which little work is wanting. The account of work performed by the Block Coopers at Southdown is at present given in by themselves every second or third day, to one of the Master Cooper's Clerks, and the first Clerk to the Clerk of the Checque, Mr. J. W. Skardon, who is the principal Officer in the Checque Department at that place: Mr. Skardon informed us, that the Master Cooper or his Foreman have some method of ascertaining whether the accounts be correct, though he himself did not understand how it was done. Having mentioned Mr. Skardon, we must not pass over without notice, that he was appointed to his situation, a place of considerable trust and importance, at a very unlit age, namely, between 16 and 17.&#x2014; We think this mode of taking the account of the work performed by the coopers, upon which their wages are paid, is very loose and unsatisfactory; we therefore recommend, that in future an account of the work completed by each individual be taken daily by a Clerk to the Clerk of the Checque, and the master-cooper or his foreman. To prevent imposition, as soon as the account has been taken of the work, the broad arrow, or some other distinguishing mark, should be put thereon, in proof of its having been carried to the account of the workman.&#x2014; A fine of 20s. is now imposed on such coopers as give in false accounts of their work, which it may be proper to continue.</p>

<section>
<title>RECEIPT, ISSUE, AND ACCOUNT OF PROVISIONS AND STORES IN GENERAL.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01840">The mode of receiving, issuing, and accounting for provisions and stores, is de-
<col>1104</col>
tailed in the evidence of the agent-victualler, Clerk of the Checque, and storekeeper. A proper survey of them, before they are received, appears to be uniformly taken. But the receiving part does not seem to be conducted quite so regularly; none of the officers are required to attend; a clerk to the Clerk of the Checque, and a storekeeper's clerk, perform this duty. We think it might be advantageous if one of the officers were to attend occasionally, together with the clerks. The provisions, before they are received or taken in charge, are sometimes brought into the store rooms, where other stores are deposited which have been received. This practice is likely to occasion mistakes, and may be made the means of fraud. We therefore recommend that the provisions not surveyed and received, should be kept as distinct as possible from those which have been received; that, as far as circumstances will allow, they should not be brought together into the store rooms; and that whenever it is done, those which have not been received should be taken in charge as soon as possible.&#x2014;Coals and staves are the only stores received from contractors at Southdown. The receipt of coals is generally attended by the clerk of the brewhouse only. The master-cooper attends the receipt of staves, and takes an account of the quantity; and although it is the duty of a Clerk to the Clerk of the Checque to attend the receipt, yet his account has sometimes been copied from that of the master-cooper. The empty casks returned from ships are received by a day-cooper. The storekeeper's clerk, and the Clerk of the Clerk of the Checque, whose duty it is to take accounts of the receipts of stores, usually copy from each other. This is an irregularity which has prevailed, more or less, in all the departments which we have inspected. Where two or more persons are required to take accounts, or make measurements, one only takes the account or measures, and the others copy from him. The object of requiring more than one to be employed on such services, namely, the prevention of frauds or mistakes, is thus wholly defeated. Attention on the part of the superior Boads, in enforcing the performance of this duty, is perhaps the only means that can be used for preventing the neglect of it.&#x2014;Hops and malt for the brewery are received at Southdown. The former are sent from the king's stores at Deptford, and taken according to the invoice. We
<image src="S1V0003P0I0567"/>
<col>1105</col>
think this article should be weighed, and an account of the weight taken before it is received into store. The matt is purchased by an Agent employed by the Victualling Board; it is measured before it is received, and a small sample of each cargo sent to the Agent-Victualler.&#x2014;The issue of provisions and stores at the Victualling-Office appears to be conducted with regularity.&#x2014;The process of accounting for provisions and stores received and issued in this department is clear, regular, and methodical; but there is a remissness in forwarding the accounts to the Board, which should be corrected. In the last war, they were at one time 7 quarters in arrear, and at the time of our enquiry, the accounts of the 3 preceding quarters had not been transmitted. The check intended by requiring accounts becomes of little use, or is entirely defeated, if they are not called for and examined at short periods after the transactions or dealings to which they relate. There is a general order of the Victualling Board, that surveys of the remains in store should be made annually. Periodical surveys are strongly recommended by the Commissioners appointed to enquire into fees, &amp;c. in their 8th Report, which treats of this department. The recommendation and observations in support of the measure appear to us extremely proper and just. But it was stated to us by the Agent-Victualler, that it is impossible to comply with the order on this subject in time of war. If it be so, it should be represented to the Board, and the order should be altered; for it tends to general laxity of discipline if disregard to orders pass unnoticed. On the other hand, if such surveys be practicable in time of war, a measure of such apparent utility and importance should not be obstructed by prejudices, or abandoned on account of difficulties which perseverance might overcome.&#x2014;It was stated to us, that when there was only a small quantity of any species of provisions in store, an account of the remains was taken, and compared with the ledger, and if any deficiency or surplus appeared, the Storekeeper was credited with the former, or charged with the latter in the quarterly account: but as the quarterly accounts have been very much in arrear, we think the deficiency or surplus discovered by surveying the remains should be noticed in the letter to the Board accompanying the weekly statement of provisions in store.&#x2014;That we might be the better able
<col>1106</col>
to judge of the correctness of the accounts, as to the receipt and issue of the provisions in this department, we called for an account of the quantities of provisions, and other articles, tarried to the credit of the Storekeeper in the quarterly accounts in each year, from the 1st Jan. 1790 to the 31st Dec. 1802, under the head of deficiencies, and of the quantities charged against him, in the way of surplus.&#x2014;Observing that the surpluses on some articles were very considerable, we required a statement of the manner in which such surpluses were supposed to have arisen.&#x2014;In so extensive a concern as the receipt and issue of provisions in the Victualling Department, it is reasonable to expect that deficiencies and surpluses should from time to time arise. But the amount of those appearing in this account, and the reasons assigned for them in the statement, sufficiently shew the necessity of taking the remains by actual surveys, as frequently as possible, that the deficiencies and surpluses should not accumulate to such an extent; that mistakes should be examined and corrected while the transactions are recent, and the occasion of such mistakes might be easily traced; and above all, that opportunities of fraud and embezzlement, which arise from the want of such checks, should be done away.&#x2014;Some anonymous communications have been made to the Victualling Board, stating that frauds have been practised in the supply of bavins by contract. Enquiries have been made by the Board, and the result has been, that the frauds imputed to the contractor were not established. Bavins, brooms, and candles, are furnished to this department by a standing contract, determinable by either party, upon giving three months notice. Contracts of this kind should be carefully watched by the superior Board; and the due performance of them, as to the quantities and quality of the article to be supplied, and the fairness of the price, should, at proper intervals, be made the subjects of their enquiries. We are led to this observation by having noticed that standing contracts are often continued with the same persons and families for many years, and have been the source of enormous frauds. An instance of the extent to which such frauds may be carried was very lately shewn upon the prosecution and conviction of the contractors for cooper's work at Woolwich; the iniquity of the parties having been proved, on the trial of

There are some Abuses in the receipt and management of them, which require to be corrected; the vessels which supply the Office with coals come chiefly from the north, and their cargoes are measured at the shipping Port by the chalder, containing 2 chaldrons, according to which measure their cockets or clearances are made out; the cargoes are measured at the time of delivery at Southdown, a Meter from the Custom-House attending to ascertain the quantity on which the duties are to be paid.&#x2014;In order to form a judgment of the correctness of the accounts of coals received for the use of the Victualling-Office, we obtained from the Officer of the Customs, an account of the quantities on which the duties had been paid, and the quantities appearing by the cockets to have been shipped oil board the ships stated to have discharged at Southdown, from 1790 to 1803; we also obtained from the Victualling-Office, an account of the quantities received for the Use of this Department during that period.&#x2014;The accounts prior to 1799, did not assist us in the object we had in view; for before that year, entire cargoes were not in general delivered at Southdown, but it was the practice for the Agent to buy parts of cargoes on the spot, as coals were wanted; since that time contracts have been made by the Board in town for entire cargoes; and it appears that the quantities for which the Contractors have been paid have considerably exceeded the cocket measure. In the delivery of seven cargoes, between Aug. 1799 and Oct. 1801, from a vessel belonging to Messrs. Henley and Son, constantly cocketed at 112 chalders, equal to 224 chaldrons, government has been charged from 239 to 260 chaldrons; an average excess of upwards of 34 chaldrons on every cargo. We conceive that this excess must have arisen from the Meter and Contractor having an interest in raising the accounts of the quantity delivered, the fees of the former and the gains of the latter being thereby encreased.&#x2014;This influence can only be counteracted by a vigilant superintendence of the person entrusted with the receipt; a duty which appears not to have been sufficiently attended to. The officers at pre-
<col>1108</col>
sent buy their coals of the Contractors with the Board, and take part of the cargoes from the vessels which supply the Victualling-Office. For the sake of certainty and clearness in the accounts of the coals furnished by contract with the Board, and to prevent the suspicion of fraud, to which the practice has given rise, we think it advisable that the officers should not be supplied by the Contractors from the ships bringing coals for the establishment.</p>

<title>SALE OF OLD STORES.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01842">The proceedings at the brewery, in respect to the sale of old stores, appear to have been very improper for some years past. The stores sold there consist of staves, hoops, and headings of casks, returned after having been issued to ships, and used for some time; the casks, when so returned, are generally examined by the foreman of the coopers, and the serviceable separated from the unserviceable; the serviceable casks which require repair, are delivered to a cooper for that purpose, who sets apart such of them as he may judge not worth repairing, and lays aside any staves, hoops, or headings, which appear to him unfit for use; the unserviceable casks are also delivered to a cooper to be taken to pieces, and he, or a labourer experienced in this business, separates the serviceable staves, hoops, and headings, from the unserviceable. Sales of these articles so deemed unserviceable are very trequent; about once every quarter or half year; and they are advertised about a fortnight or 3 weeks before-hand. The articles are sold in lots, and the catalogues of sale give notice that the goods are to be taken with all their faults.&#x2014;The following Abuses and Irregularities are said to have attended these sales.&#x2014;The sales are usually advertised before the lots are completed, and frequently more Jots are sold than are even begun to be made up at the time of sale. The buyers are permitted to reject such articles as are broken or decayed (though the goods, according to the conditions of sale, are to be taken with all their faults) and they often receive articles which are serviceable in exchange for those which they reject. The lots are sometimes taken away at improper seasons, very early in the morning, very late in the evening, or in the night; and the buyers (by collusion with persons whose duty it is to prevent such frauds) have in some instances
<image src="S1V0003P0I0569"/>
<col>1109</col>
received quantities of serviceable staves, hoops, and headings, in addition to the lots actually purchased, or instead of such parts of them as they have chosen to leave.&#x2014;It may be thought, upon referring to the examinations on this subject, that the evidence does not incontrovertibly prove the existence of all these evils to the extent above stated; but we apprehend the existence of several of them is clearly established; and as to the rest, there is at least so much reason to believe they have existed, that precautions for preventing them in future will be deemed highly necessary.&#x2014;It is manifest that the sale of lots not begun to be made up, or made up in part only, and to be completed after the sale, cannot be advantageous to the seller. Few will venture to bid for articles which they have no opportunity of inspecting and valuing, and it is hardly credible that buyers of lots, so circumstanced, should have been found from time to time for several years, unless they had had some secret understanding with the persons who were afterwards to make up or complete the lots for them. A reason was alleged for this practice, namely, that between the times of advertizing and selling, the old stores accumulated, and it was convenient to get rid of them; but the frequent recurrence of these sales destroys that excuse.&#x2014;We think the practice should be entirely done away, and we recommend that for the future, all the lots of such stores be completed, and a report of them made to the Board before the intended sale is advertised; and that no articles which have not been so lotted be sold, or allowed to be taken away by the buyers, upon any pretence whatever.&#x2014;The permitting of the buyers to change some of the defective articles in their lots for others is an indulgence open to abuse, which should therefore be abolished. The Conditions of Sale should be strictly, enforced in this respect, instead of being varied by declarations of the agent at the time of sale; which (as we were told) has been usual, though never authorized by the Board.&#x2014;The removal of lots at unseasonable hours should also be prevented, and a time of day should be fixed for that purpose, which might be the common working hours at the brewery, when the general attendance of persons employed there would be a check to collusion and embezzlement; and the master-cooper or his foreman, as well as a Clerk in the Checque
<col>1110</col>
Department, should constantly attend the delivery.&#x2014;According to the present practice, the lots are advertised and sold as containing specific quantities; which gives the buyer power to reject a part, or require an addition, according as the lot bought happens to exceed or fail short of the amount stated in the Particulars of Sale. We think it advisable that the lots (which might still be made as nearly as may be to certain convenient quantities) should be advertised and sold as containing such quantities, be they more or less, and that the buyers should be obliged to take the whole of the lots at the rate of price by weight or number bid for them.&#x2014;We conceive it might have a good effect for the preventing and detecting of Frauds and Abuses in sales of this sort, if an account of every sale, containing the names and places of abode of the several buyers, and the description, quantities, and prices of the lots bought by them, were put up in some conspicuous part of the brewery, within a few days after the sale, and kept there till the next sale.&#x2014;For preventing embezzlement of King's stores, it would be advantageous if no stores having the King's mark were sold. This precaution might easily be adopted with respect to two of the articles before mentioned, namely, the staves and headings, for they are necessarily examined for the purpose of ascertaining whether they are or are not serviceable, and the marks are only put on a few of them compared with the whole, which few might either be applied to the purpose of fuel, or the marks on them might be effaced without much trouble or expence. Such a precaution might have the good effect of facilitating the proof of embezzlement against persons in whose custody goods of this description should be found having the King's mark. It is a fact pretty well ascertained, that embezzlement of King's casks has been carried to a great extent in this neighbourhood; and surely every proper regulation for preventing such a mischief should be adopted.&#x2014;There are sales also at the Victualling office at Plymouth, which are not merely of hoops, staves, and headings, as at Southdown, but also include provisions decayed, or likely to be spoiled by keeping. We do not find that the same Abuses have prevailed there as at Southdown. But we should recommend in all sales of this sort, that the conduct of the persons having the direc-

tion and management of them, be particularly attended to by the Board.

<title>EMBEZZLEMENT OF THE KING'S CASKS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01844">Having examined into a transaction respecting the embezzlement of some casks, the property of the Crown, we found the circumstances of the case so extraordinary, that we feel it our duty to detail them.&#x2014;In the beginning of Dec. 1801, before or on the 3d of that month, Mr. Thomas Miller, the Agent-Victualler at Plymouth, received intimation that some butts or casks belonging to the Victualling-Office were concealed at a Brewery called the Turner brewery in Maurice Town, near Plymouth Dock.&#x2014;The partners in the brewery were Messrs. Frederick Dansey, John White, Perry Fitzherbert, and Martin Thomas, the greatest brewers at Plymouth Dock, and considered as persons of respectability and property; Mr. White was the managing partner, and resided at the brewery.&#x2014;On Friday the 4th of Dec, the Agent-Victualler having obtained S search-warrant, went to the brewery with Mr. Joseph Pridham, an attorney, Mr. Samuel Triscott, the first foreman of the coopers in the Victualling Department at Plymouth, and John Harry, a constable: Mr. White was there, and being informed that they had a warrant, and were come to search for King's casks, he went over the premises with them, opening the cellars, which they examined.&#x2014;In one of them which was locked, there were fount 3 empty butts with the heads out. These butts had the King's mark, namely, the broad arrow, distinctly visible upon them and they had also the block or private mark usually placed on the casks by the coopers who make them, by which it appeared that they were manufactured a Southdown, the brewery belonging to the Victualling-office, 2 or 3 miles from Man rice Town on the other side of the water. In the same cellar there were 11 other butts also empty, and with the heads out; from these the King's mark appeared to have been lately effaced, the places when the mark is usually made having beer fresh chipped or dubbed; and in other
<col>1112</col>
parts of the premises not locked, there were found 53 more butts, of which 41 were filled with beer; all the 53 appear to have been marked with the King's mark, from their having been chipped or dubbed in the places where the King's mark is usually put: from some of these 64 the block or private mark appeared also to have been effaced; the dubbing was more fresh on some of the butts than on others, and the chips wore lying on the ground under the butts, and scattered about the cellars.&#x2014;The 3 butts on which the King's mark was plainly visible were headed in the presence of the agent-victualler, marked by him and Mr. Samuel Triscott, that they might afterwards be identified, and were removed from the brewery to the Victualling-Office as soon as the search was over. The remaining 64 butts were not removed, no mark was set on them by which they might be known again, nor was any one left at the brewery to take charge of them, till the proper steps to be pursued should be considered and determined.&#x2014;The marks on the 3 butts, and the places from which they appeared to have been effaced in the other 64, were pointed out by the agent-victualler to Mr. White, the only partner present at the search: and Mr. White was asked how the butts came into his possession: he answered, they were part of a lot, consisting of 100 of the same description, purchased for the Company in London. On the next day, Saturday the 5th, about noon, the agent-victualler, Mr. Pridham, and Mr. Triscott, went again to the brewery; during the interval between their leaving it very late the preceding evening and their return, the beer had been drawn off from the 41 butts, which were left full, and these butts, as well as the others that were empty, and from which the King's marks appeared to have been effaced, amounting altogether to 64, had been shaken, that is, taken to pieces, and the staves and hoops of which they had been made were lying about in the brewery; at this time several coopers were at work there.&#x2014;On the same day, namely, Saturday the 5th Dec. the agent-victualler and Mr. Triscott laid an information before a justice of the peace, stating, that they suspected the 64 butts to be victualling stores belonging to the Crown, and praying that they might be deemed forfeited, and returned to his Majesty's store; and further, that the parties might be adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor, and be summoned to answer.&#x2014;They were accord-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0571"/>
<col>1113</col>
ingly summoned to appear on Tuesday the 8th of the same month, and attended before the justice; they did not give a satisfactory account how the butts came into their possession, nor did they produce any evidence of their having bought them in London, as Mr. White had asserted, nor in what manner they had got them; whereupon the magistrate adjudged that the 64 butts should be forfeited, and should be returned into his Majesty's Store; he also adjudged that the defendants had been guilty of a misdemeanor, and should pay a tine of 40s. this being their first offence.&#x2014;Between the 4th and 10th of this month, the agent-victualler and Mr. Pridham were two or three times at the brewery; they constantly found several coopers employed there, and among them one Gilbert Hearder, of whom we shall have occasion to speak more particularly hereafter; upon the 10th the 64 butts were returned into the King's Store at Southdown, but in the mean time they had been taken to pieces, as before noticed, and set up again in such a way as not to be fit for holding liquor; the reason for their having been shaken is obvious; they were set up again because the agent-victualler required it.&#x2014;The brewers were indicted at the ensuing sessions, for unlawfully having in their possession the 3 first mentioned butts marked with the broad arrow, which were seized and taken away at the time of the search; the agent-victualler and Mr. Triscott attended as witnesses before the grand Jury, when the bill was preferred; they both swore positively that the 3 butts were King's stores, and pointed out to the jurors the marks by which they knew them to be so; nevertheless the bill was not found, which was ascribed by the agent-victualler and Mr. Pridham to the jury's having been biassed by some improper practices; a surmise (as it seemed to us) not without foundation.&#x2014;All enquiry into this business ended here, and the supposed offenders were no further prosecuted.&#x2014;We apprehend that this statement alone will serve to shew that the matter in question was not sufficiently investigated, and that it was not prosecuted in such a way as to clear the parties implicated, if they were innocent; or to satisfy justice, if they were guilty.&#x2014;The disclosure to which our enquiry led, and the circumstances which we are about to relate, will be found to justify this remark. We called before us all the persons from whom the agent-victualler
<col>1114</col>
was supposed to have received his information; these were J. Clark and W. Netherton, coopers employed in the victualling department, and G. Hearder, a working cooper, to whom we before alluded as employed about the butts at the Tamar brewery soon after this search.&#x2014;The most material circumstance proved by Clark is, that upon taking off the hoops of the 3 butts which had been brought to the Vic-tualliug office, he found them marked with the broad arrow on the inside; so far confirming the judgment of the agent-victualler and Mr. Triscott, that the butts belonged to the Crown; a fact indeed so clear, that we think no reasonable doubt could exist about it. The evidence of Hearder was very important; he proved that butts marked with the King's mark, were frequently brought to the Yard of the Tamar brewery about the end of the year 1801; that this was notorious among the persons who worked there; that he mentioned it about the 28th of Nov. in that year to W. Netherton; that he continued working with his master, Mr. John Head of Plymouth Dock, after the casks were seized, till the 17th of Dec. 1801, when he was induced to absent himself, that he might not be called upon to give evidence, and did not return till after the sessions; that though he refused to go to the agent-victualler, who sent for him to examine him, still he met the agent-victualler several times before he left Plymouth Dock, and might have been summoned before the justice, or spoken with at his master's, if any one had gone there for that purpose; that soon after the search, he was employed with his master and other workmen in setting up the casks which had been shaken with the same staves and hoops; that some of the staves appeared to have been fresh drawn or cut where the King's marks are usually put, but he did not examine the hoops for the King's mark; that the butts appeared to have been made at Southdown, were good and serviceable, and worth about 24 or 25s. apiece; that he was supplied with money to go from Plymouth Dock by Mr. Thomas Warne, and received remittances from him during his absence; that his master gave him 10l. on his return to buy clothes, and advanced his wages; and that Mr. White, one of the partners, to whom he applied for a loan of money in May 1803, introduced him to a Mr. Carpenter, a perfect stranger to him, who advanced him 40l. on his bond con-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0572"/>
<col>1115</col>
ditioned for repayment in 3 years, or when called for.&#x2014;In the evidence of this young man, who was before us three different times, two matters were stated by him, in which he was afterwards contradicted by the agent-victualler; one related to a conversation between the agent-victualler and him, after his return to Plymouth Dock, respecting a letter which had been sent to the Victualling Board concerning these casks; the other related to another conversation between the agent-victualler and him, after he had been examined by us the first time: but from the manner in which he gave his testimony, from the confirmation which it received from other quarters in many respects, and particularly from the evidence of Thomas Warne, whom we afterwards examined, we are inclined to believe that Hearder did not wilfully falsify in any respect.&#x2014;The evidence of Netherton is also material; he confirms Hearder's account in several particulars; he states that he mentioned Hearder to the agent-victualler, as the person from whom be had learned that the King's casks were at the Tamar Brewery; that he saw the 3 butts which were seized, and noticed the broad arrow on the hoops, but was not sent for afterwards by the agent-victualler; and when his apprenticeship expired, namely, in Dec. 1802, he was discharged from the victualling department.&#x2014;This witness also gave his evidence very fairly, and we saw no cause for supposing that he designedly misrepresented any fact.&#x2014;We also examined Mr. John Head, the master-cooper before mentioned, and W. Williams and J. Cock, working-coopers, who were employed, together with Mr. Head, at the Tamar Brewery in Dec. 1801.&#x2014;J. Cock's evidence confirmed Hearder's in many respects; this man went to work at the Brewery about a month before the search, saw several casks there having the King's marks on them, and in particular spoke of 4 or 5 which he said must have been brought there in the night; it appears too from his evidence, that the King's marks seen by him on the casks at the brewery, were erased between the 5th of Nov. and 4th of Dec. 1801; and he also mentioned a circumstance by no means immaterial, namely, that Mr. Head proposed to him not to come forward; or have any, thing to say about the business unless he was called upon.&#x2014;Mr. Head and W. Williams gave their evidence as persons not willing, to disclose what they knew;
<col>1116</col>
and we do not hesitate to say, that they were not deserving of credit.&#x2014;Mr. Head, however, after some hesitation, admitted that he might have given Hearder 10l. after his return to Plymouth, and that he had allowed him 5s. a week from that time in addition to his wages, which, he said, he gave him for the support of his mother. In these particulars he confirmed Hearder, of whom too it should be noticed, that Mr. Head had never dismissed him from his service, but still continued to employ him, and even trusted him with the management of part of his business.&#x2014;The evidence given by W. Williams shewed that he paid no regard to truth, and that it was impossible we should believe him. There are two circumstances in the evidence of Mr. J. Chissel, employed as Ton man at the Brewery, which deserve notice: 1st, he states, that to the best of his knowledge there were not above 20 butts on the premises just before the search, beyond those which were afterwards taken away as belonging to the King; and 2d, that several persons were employed during all the night after the search, in knocking down the butts by the order of Mr. White, who was backwards and forwards several times in the course of that night.&#x2014;W. Davy's account of his conversation with Mr. Head, compared with Mr. Head's evidence, strengthened our observation, that the latter was not entitled to credit. The evidence of Mr. T. Warne, victualler, a tenant and customer of Messrs. Dansey, White, and Co. proved that Hearder's absenting himself from Plymouth Dock was known to all the partners, and that they supplied the money for his expences in going away, and for his support till his return. We also examined Mr. Miller the agent-victualler, Mr. Pridham the attorney, and Mr. Triscott the first foreman to the coopers. It appeared from the evidence of Mr. Triscott, that no butts are sold at the Victualling-Office or at Southdown, nor any staves fit to make such butts as were found at the Brewery; and that he had no doubt but that the 64 butts (of which some were almost new) as well as the three taken away, belonged to the Victualling-Office. The evidence of the agent-victualler agreed in these particulars with that of Mr. Triscott. In the account given by Mr. Pridham of his proceedings, it is observable, that he made no minutes of what passed either at the times when be was at the Brewery after
<image src="S1V0003P0I0573"/>
<col>1117</col>
the search, or when he was at the sessions at Exeter; that he never examined any of the persons from whom the agent-victualler was understood to have received his information, nor summoned them as witnesses before the Justice, nor required them to attend at the sessions; that he never examined any of the coopers whom he saw at work at the Brewery after the search; that he proceeded before the Justice in the manner stated, without any previous communication of all the circumstances of this extraordinary case to the solicitor for the Victualling-Office; that though he forwarded copies of the deposition and other proceedings before the magistrate (on which deposition we shall have occasion to make a few observations hereafter) yet he never made a full statement of all the particulars of this transaction; and the very material fact of the 64 butts having been shaken in the course of the night alter the search, appears never to have been mentioned to the Board by Mr. Pridham or the agent-victualler; and the affidavit of Mr. White, which would have led to the knowledge of that fact, was never transmitted to the Board. With respect to the agent-victualler, we must observe, that we did not obtain from him an account so clear and satisfactory as might have been expected; he had no distinct recollection from whom he first received the information that the King's Casks were at the Tamar Brewery; yet, in a letter to the Board respecting W. Netherton, who had claimed the merit of having given this information, as a reason for the Board's employing him in his business at the-Victualling-Office, from which he had been dismissed, the agent-victualler asserts that such claim was totally false.&#x2014;The evidence of W. Netherton and of the agent-victualler vary considerably as to the purport of the information, and the time when it was given. The account of the former had more the appearance of correctness, for be spoke as a person having a complete recollection of the circumstances, while the agent-victualler seemed to have only an imperfect remembrance of them, and gave his testimony with some embarrassment. It appears also from the agent-victualler's evidence, that even at the time of the search, the 4th of Dec. he had DO doubt but that all the 67 butts found at the Brewery belonged to the Victualling-Office, and that henoticed not merely the broad arrow on 3 of them, but also the marks having been erased from the 64, the wood
<col>1118</col>
being fresh cut in several of them, and the dubbings which had been cut out lying immediately under the casks. This last circumstance was also noticed by Mr. Pridham; yet the deposition sworn by the agent-victualler and Mr. Triscott on the 8th of Dec. and forwarded to the Board by Mr. Pridham, asserts only that there was reasonable cause to suspect and believe that these butts were victualling stores; and states that the deponents could not discover whether the marks were cut out or defaced before or after the 64 butts came into the possession of Messrs. Dansey, White, and Co. The agent-victualler further states, that there were private or block marks on the 3 butts which were the subject of the Prosecution at the sessions, and that Mr. Triscott knew the names of the coopers who made them; yet no enquiry for these persons appears to have been made, and they were not produced to give evidence at the sessions: it is manifest that their evidence would have been most important. It is remarkable too that the agent-victualler, after he knew, and had observed at the Brewery that the 64 butts had been shaken, does not notice this circumstance in his letter to the Board of the 8th of Dec. but simply informs them, that the 64 butts would be forthwith delivered in charge of the master-cooper, to be returned into the Stores at his Majesty's Cooperage at Southdown; by which the Board were not made acquainted with a very material fact, and must have been led to believe that the butts in question were to be restored in a perfect state. We also learned from the agent-victualler, that Mr. Eastlake of Plymouth, whom the Navy Board have employed many years as their attorney in matters of this sort, was also employed by the Victualling-Office prior to Mr. Miller's appointment as agent-victualler, which was in May 1799; but from that time Mr. Miller had employed Mr. Pridham on behalf of the latter Board, from motives of private regard, without previously consulting the Board upon the change of their attorney, and obtaining their concurrence in the measure. We are sorry to remark that an attentive examiner of the evidence given by the several witnesses in this extraordinary case, will find some matters asserted on one hand, and denied on the other, producing direct contradictions of such a nature as can hardly have originated in error.&#x2014;Yet amidst these contradictions some facts seem clearly established, which
<image src="S1V0003P0I0574"/>
<col>1119</col>
warrant the following observations: the enquiry into this gross embezzlement of the King's Stores, upon the first discovery of it, was not pursued with diligence or ability which such a case required; the agent-victualler, and the attorney whom he employed, were either not willing to put in force the full power of the law against the parties concerned in it, or did not know in what manner they ought to have been prosecuted. If the partners or any of them wilfully and fraudulently erased, or procured any other person to erase the King's marks from the butts found at the Brewery, for the purpose of concealing his Majesty's property in them (of which we conceive there was very strong presumptive evidence) the offence was felony, and the offender was liable to be transported for 14 years by the 30th and 40th Geo. III. c. 89. s. 4. therefore, instead of an information before a justice of the neighbourhood in which the brewers resided, or a prosecution at the quarter sessions for a misdemeanor, we think a bill of indictment for felony should have been preferred at the assizes. The prosecution at the sessions was not supported by the best evidence that might have been adduced, and some material circumstances which ought to have been made known to the Victualling Board were never disclosed to them.&#x2014;To prevent as far as may be a recurrence of a similar evil, we recommend that all persons entrusted with the superintendence of King's Stores, receiving information of any embezzlement of them, should be required to take minutes thereof in writing, and state the same fully and truly to the superior Board; and that they should be restrained from instituting any prosecution in cases of magnitude or difficulty without the Board's direction: In such cases, we apprehend, that prosecuting at the assizes ought generally to be preferred to proceeding before a magistrate or at the sessions. Prosecutions at the assizes have the advantage of being more public, and are less liable to be suppressed or defeated by improper motives or corrupt influence. No officer under the control of the Victualling-Office, or other Board of that description, should change their attorney, or retain a new one in their concerns, without first proposing it to the Board, and obtaining an express authority for the purpose.&#x2014;We endeavoured to ascertain how the casks in question came into the possession of Messrs. Dan-
<col>1120</col>
sey, White, and Co. but without succeeding. Empty casks are returned from the men of war by craft hired for the purpose; should there be collusion between the masters of these vesselsand the day-cooper intrusted with the receipt of casks at Southdown, the embezzlement might be carried to a considerable extent: we therefore recommend that a clerk be employed to take account of the casks returned, and that the attention of the master cooper be directed to that object.

<title>RECEIPT AND ISSUE OF STORES IN PLYMOUTH YARD.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01848">IN our Sixth Report, we confined our observations to the mode of employing and paying the different classes of Artificers and Workmen in His Majesty's Dock Yard at Plymouth, to which subject our mention was more particularly directed. We propose, in our present Report, to state the result of our enquiries respecting the Receipt and Issue of Stores; but previously to entering on the subject we must observe, that our enquiries have been in
<image src="S1V0003P0I0575"/>
<col>1121</col>
general greatly impeded, and in some instances wholly frustrated, by the very loose manner in which the business of the Dock Yard has been conducted, and the length of time such irregularity has been suffered to exist, particularly in the department of the Storekeeper. On the dismissal of that officer in 1802, his accounts were 5 years in arrear, and although clerks have been since entered for the express purpose of bringing up such arrears, jet at the time of our enquiry the Accounts had only been balanced for the years 1797 and 1798. In pursuing our enquiries, we directed our attention to the more material articles; a minute investigation of every particular would have occupied much time, which we were of opinion might be more advantageously employed in the pursuit of other objects. We shall in the outset give a brief account of the process of Receiving and Issuing Stores; and then proceed with the Report, under different heads, in the manner we have before pursued. Stores delivered at the Yard are surveyed by the clerk officers, namely the clerk of the checque, storekeeper, and clerk of the survey, and one of the professional officers, the master shipwright or master attendant, according to the nature of the Mores. All articles of wood and others placed in the charge of the carpenters of his majesty's ships, are in the department of the master shipwright; the cordage, sails, and other articles in charge of the. boatswains, are in the department of the master attendant. The surveying officers are assisted by the judgment of the master workmen, who always attend the receipt of stores used in their respective branches, and give their opinion as to their quality and fitness for the service. Two days in the week, Tuesdays and Fridays, are fixed for surveying stores. If the Stoics he approved upon survey, they are received as soon afterwards as circumstances will admit. The term "Received," means the ascertaining of the quantity either by tale, weight, or measure, and taking an account thereof, after which they become a part of his majesty's Stores. Certificates of the quantities received, with the prices, are made out as often as the contractors may require, in order to their obtaining payment of the Navy Board. The articles are weighed, counted, or measured, in the presence of three clerks, one from the checque office, one from the storekeeper's office, and one from the
<col>1122</col>
clerk of the survey's office, who are directed to take separate accounts; and the officers of those departments attend by turns weekly the receipt of Stores. It is stated by the present Storekeeper, that on his appointment it was not a general practice to require from the contractors, invoices or bills of parcels of the stores sent into the Yard, but that none are now received without such documents. This is a very commendable precaution, and it is a matter of surprise that it should at any time have been neglected. Some further regulation, however, is necessary to prevent the evil which it seems intended to check. In most cases, vessels are discharged of their cargoes, and the Stores lodged either in the Yard or in the Storehouses, previous to their being surveyed and received. Many of the articles are placed in the Storehouses where they are eventually to be deposited, and as the invoice or bill of parcels is not required when the Stores are delivered, but only previous to their being received; it is no check upon any improper practices between the lime of their delivery and receipt; and it is allowed by the officers, that in case of collusion between contractor and the clerks of storehouse labourers, it is possible that stores which lave been paid for, may be placed with the contractors; in such instances the contractor might make out his invoice or bill of parcels accordingly, and he would of course be paid for a greater quantity than he bad actually delivered. We are therefore of opinion, that no stores should be allowed to be deposited in the Yard or Storehouses without an invoice or bill of parcels being produced, and the number of packages compared therewith. The stores sent into this Yard by land carriage ire only some light articles, and such as are supplied by contractors residing in the neighbourhood. We think that on their being admitted into the Yard, the warden should examine the number of packages with the bill of parcels, and sign it if they agree. Any collusion of this nature would be more effectually prevented by the appropriation of a room properly fitted up for the purpose of receiving stores; and we are of opinion, it would be advantageous that the bills of parcels should contain the prices as well as the quantities of the articles, by which the officers, at the time of survey, would have a more immediate opportunity of judging of the propriety of the prices,
<image src="S1V0003P0I0576"/>
<col>1123</col>
and consulting with the master workmen. When any articles may be obtained at lower prices in the neighbourhood, or when the officers may conceive those charged are too high, we think they should report the same to the Navy Board. Some communications have been made to the Public Board, of Frauds practised by the means we have before alluded to, and one in particular by George Thorne, who wa5 foreman of the Storehouse Labourers in this Yard, and convicted of embezzling his majesty's stores; wherein he stated, among other abuses, that empty chests had frequently been filled with the king's candles, and received again as a new delivery from the contractor. Although this fact was not proved by the examination which we made into it, yet the possibility of such Frauds being practised sufficiently warrants the adoption of measures of precaution. A bill of lading always accompanies the stores sent from one of his majesty's Yards to another. They are taken account of on delivery, by one of the Storekeeper's clerks, and such account is afterwards compared with the bill of lading. These accounts have frequently been found to differ considerably; formerly the differences were adjusted by the respective storekeepers, but the Navy Board have very properly directed that particular reports thereof should be made to them. The clerks who attend the receipt of stores take the account in rough books, the receipts are afterwards entered in books, kept in sections, and are abstracted monthly. The storekeeper is charged with stores under three heads&#x2014;"Received from Contractors"&#x2014;"Received from other Yards"&#x2014;and, "Manufactured in the Yard:" the stores so received are brought into one total, and carried to his debit in the ledger. The ledger is balanced quarterly, and contains merely an abstract of the receipts and issues. To the balance of the preceding quarter brought forward as a charge, is added the total of the Stores received within the quarter; and on the credit side is inserted in one line the total of the Stores issued, the latter is deducted from the former, and the balance carried forward as a new charge. The ledger when completed is transmitted to the Navy Board, with the sections of receipts, and the bills of lading. The Issues made by the storekeeper are either for his Majesty's ships, or for the current services of the Yard. The Issues to his
<col>1124</col>
majesty's ships are regulated by establishments fixed by the Navy Board for each class, for home or foreign service. When a ship is ordered to be commissioned, the clerk of the survey makes out warrants to the storekeeper, to issue the stores allowed by the establishment for the service upon which the ship may be ordered. Alter a ship has been fitted, the captain demands stores, to replace those which have been expended, and forwards, with each demand, a certified abstract of the remains. The demands are examined by the master shipwright and master attendant in their respective departments, and if approved, the clerk of the survey gives notes to the storekeeper to supply the Stores, provided they do not exceed the establishment. The warrants and notes are registered and numbered hi the store, keeper's office, and are then sent by a messenger to the storehouses, in order that the stores may be issued. The Issues of Stores for the current service of the Yard, and for ships repairing, except timber, are in the first instance made to the cabin keepers; who, as we stated in our Sixth Report, are a description of petty storekeepers. The Stores are issued to the cabin keepers, upon notes signed by the master shipwright and clerk of the survey; these are termed credit notes, because the storekeeper is not discharged of the stores until their subsequent appropriation; accounts of which are kept by the cabin keepers, and notes are thereupon given by the master shipwright, and clerk of the survey to the storekeeper, stating the services to which they have been applied, and the specific quantities used, of which the storekeeper discharges himself accordingly. The books of the respective cabin keepers are examined and balanced monthly, by a clerk to the storekeeper, and a clerk to the clerk of the survey, and an actual survey of their remains is made every 3 months by the clerk of the survey, and one of the assistants to the Master Shipwright. The issues made by the storekeeper are transcribed monthly from the notes and warrants, and are afterwards abstracted; at the expiration of a quarter, the total quantities issued are carried into the ledger. The original notes and transcripts are sent with the ledger to the Navy Board. Having stated generally the process of receiving and issuing stores, and the mode of charging and discharging the storekeeper, we shall

now proceed to state the result of our enquiries under the following heads; viz. 1. Timber; 2. Hemp; 3. Iron; 4. Coals; 5. Paint Work; 6. Contracts in the Yard; 7. Sale of Old Stores.</p>

<title>TIMBER.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01849">On this subject we examined Mr. T. Netherton, first clerk to the clerk of the checque; Mr. J. Knapman, second clerk to the storekeeper; T. Stephens, a labourer who had been employed 36 years in the receipt of timber; Mr. T. Jenner, master mast-maker; Mr. T. Strover, the present timber master, and Joseph Tucker, esq. master shipwright. From the evidence of the three former, it is very apparent that the various regulations established by the Navy Board upon the receipt of this article, were during the late war in great part neglected. The standing orders of the Navy Board directed, that the master shipwright, (his assistants), clerk of the checque, storekeeper, and clerk of the survey, or any two of them, should attend at the receipt of all timber; that the officers should take especial care that the measurers measured every piece, each measurer separately; and that they agreed as to the dimensions and contents before the timber was received. The measurers consisted of a clerk from the checque's, storekeeper's, and survey's offices, and a person selected from the class of shipwrights, who was styled master shipwright's measurer. The officers were to see that each log was marked with a progressive number, the initials of the contractor's name, and of the officers present at the receipt, and the date of the year: great care was directed to be taken that the timber, on receipt, was compared with the purveyor's reports, and that none was received unless the purveyor's reports were produced; and the officers were to keep a very particular account of every piece; inserting against each the number stamped thereon by the purveyor, so that recourse might be easily bad to any piece. When an offer of timber is made to the Navy Board, it is the practice to send a purveyor, who is always a shipwright, to view the timber, and if judged by him fit for the service, he stamps his initials and a number on each log, and having ascertained the rough contents, he makes a particular report thereof to the Navy Board, a copy of which is forwarded to the Yard. The timber from the forest of
<col>1126</col>
Dean is delivered at this Yard, and in that forest there is a resident purveyor, who makes a report of the timber felled there annually, similar to the reports made by the purveyors of timber supplied on contract. In the former instance, although the contractor is paid only for what he actually delivers at the Yard, the comparison of the timber with the report insures the delivery of the identical timber which has been viewed and approved by the purveyor; but in the latter case, it was the only checque upon the due delivery of the quantity of timber felled in his majesty's forests, which is conveyed by contract from thence to the Yard. Notwithstanding the great importance of this comparison, especially upon the delivery of timber from the King's forests, it appears by the evidence of T. Stephens, that it was neglected upon the receipt of sided timber from 1792 to 1801, and for about 10 years upon the receipt of rough timber; and this is in great part admitted by Mr. Knapman, the second clerk to the storekeeper, who was employed during the late war in the receipt of timber. Although the directions of the Navy Board were so positive as to the attendance of at least two officers, it appears that this part of their duty, during the late war, was greatly neglected; and it is stated by Mr. Knapman, that timber was more frequently received without than with the attendance of any of the clerk officers. The attendance of the clerks or measurers, likewise, has been by no means regular. Timber has been received by the builder's measurer and one clerk only, and sometimes without the attendance of any clerk. The assistant to the master shipwright, whose duty it was to survey and qualify the timber, or determine on the purposes for which it was applicable, was the only officer who regularly attended the receipt. Even when the clerks did attend, it appears that the more material part of the measurement, which the officers were strictly directed to see executed by the measurers, was invariably performed by T. Stephens, the labourer who attended them, and the shipwrights who were employed to search the timber for defects, called timber tasters. By this general neglect the receipt of timber, an article of the first importance, was in a great measure entrusted to persons in very subordinate situations. The clerks who neglected to attend, lnade their entries from the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0578"/>
<col>1127</col>
account of the builder's measurer. It is Stated by Mr. Netherton, that the clerk of the checque's book of the receipt of timber was not regularly kept up during the late war; and that recourse was therefore obliged to be had to the books of other offices to make out the certificates to the contractors; and it appears by the Report of a Committee of the Navy Board, dated 9th Feb. 1802, that in the Timber receipt books produced to them from die storekeeper's and clerk of the survey's offices, entries which should have been made at the periods of receipt some years before, had evidently been written only a few hours previous to their examination. The important precaution, directed by the Navy Board, of marking each log upon its receipt with a progressive number, and the initials of the officers attending (whereby, in case of any suspicion of fraud or collusion, the timber might easily have been re-examined) was likewise for some years neglected: but prior to the discontinuance of that practice, it was little more than matter of form, as the initials of the officer, whose turn it was to attend the receipt, were stamped in whether he attended or not; and the labourer, whose duty it was to mark the logs, assigned as a reason for so doing, that if he had not put the initials of the officer whose week it was, whether present or not, "the initials of no clerk officer would "appear on the logs." In the receipt of Masts and Fir Timber it was stated to us, that the officers were more regular in their attendance than on the receipt of Oak Timber; but even these articles have been received without any officer being present. The master shipwright, or one of his assistants, attended the survey, and the master mast-maker likewise attended the survey and receipt of masts. When the master shipwright and the other officers have been called away upon other duty, the measurers have proceeded with the receipt of Fir Timber, putting by for survey such pieces as appeared defective. As the inattention of the officers and clerks to the receipt of Timber gave great opportunity for collusion and fraud, and as in the course of our Enquiry we found that fees, to a considerable amount, had been regularly paid to the clerks and measurers, which in the year 1798, on their application to the contractors, were more than doubled, we issued our precepts for the following accounts; with a view to ascer-
<col>1128</col>
tain the effect which this culpable negligence had produced: 1. An account of the quantity of English Timber in store on the 1st of Oct. 1790. 2. An Account of the quantities of English Timber received from that time to the 17th of Dec. 1802, when a general survey of that article was made by the late Timber Master. 3. An Account of the quantities of English timber converted within that period, distinguishing the quantities converted to the uses for which it had been received, and the quantities which from defects, or other causes, had been applied to inferior purposes: And, 4. An Account of the quantity and state of the English Timber in store on the 18th of Dec. 1802.&#x2014;After a considerable lapse of time, we were furnished with some of the accounts required; but it was afterwards discovered that they were incorrect, owing to the very loose manner in which the accounts of the receipt and expenditure had been kept, and to the business in the store-keeper's department being so much in arrear. As from these circumstances, it must have occupied much of the time of the storekeeper and his clerks to have made out the accounts anew, and as, with every care and attention, the correctness of them would have been very doubtful, we declined pursuing the matter further. In July 1801 a new officer was established, styled Timber Master; who is selected from the assistants to the master shipwright, and is entrusted with the receipt and conversion of Timber. The accounts kept by that officer are arranged in a most clear and satisfactory manner, and are so particular, as to shew the purpose for which every log is received, the quantity of Timber paid for, the use to which each log is converted, and the contents of the Timber so converted, with the uses to which the inferior parts may be applied. This register, when examined by the Navy Board, is an effectual check upon the conduct and good management of the Timber Master. Previous to the establishment of the office of Timber Master, there was a subordinate officer called a Converter, selected from the shipwrights, whose pay was 2s. 6d. a day; but the quartermen frequently took upon themselves to convert timber for the works carrying on by their respective gangs. In such a mode of conducting business, where no person in particular was responsible, neither regularity nor accuracy could be expected;
<image src="S1V0003P0I0579"/>
<col>1129</col>
and it has been stated to us, that in many instances the timber was disadvantageously converted, which occasioned a considerable loss to the public.</p>

<title>HEMP.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01850">The Hemp, previous to its being received, is surveyed by the master attendant, clerk of the survey, and master rope-maker, who certify to the Navy Board its fitness for the service upon the back of the certificates, by which the contractors obtain payment. Those officers, it is stated, generally attend the opening of 4 or 5 bundles at the beginning of each delivery, and occasionally inspect others during the receipt of the cargo. A foreman of the ropemakers constantly attends the receipt, and causes such hemp as may be of inferior quality, or damaged, to be set aside, the contracts being made for good and clean Hemp only.&#x2014;In order to ascertain whether there had been any improper practices in the receipt of this article, we called on the officers of the Yard for an account of the quantities for which the contractors had been paid, from the year 1790 to 1802, with the names of the ships by which they were imported; and we obtained from the commissioners of the customs an account of the Hemp imported by those ships on which the duty had been paid, distinguishing the quantities landed in the Dock Yard from the quantities landed elsewhere. Upon a comparison of these accounts, it appeared, that the quantities certified to have been received by the officers of the Yard, uniformly exceeded the quantities stated by the officers of the customs to have been delivered there, in a proportion of about 8 or 9 cwt. to every 100 tons. On enquiring into this circumstance, we found that such difference arose from an allowance made to the merchant by the officers of the customs, on each weighing, for the draught of the scale, which was not required by the officers of the Yard, they giving the contractor credit for the exact quantity delivered. It might have been expected that the allowance made by government to the merchant, on the payment of the duties, would have been made by the contractors on the delivery of the goods at the Dock Yard; but it has been stated to us, that it is not usual with merchants in the port of London to make any allowance to each other for the draughts of the scale on the sale of Hemp. The
<col>1130</col>
allowance made for the draught of the scale fully explains the difference between the Dock Yard and Custom House accounts of the Hemp delivered; and as we obtained an account of several cargoes as shipped at Petersburgh, which, on reducing the Russian weights into English, we found nearly corresponded with the quantities delivered, there is every reason to believe there has not been any abuse in the receipt of this article; more especially as we find the clerk of the Rope Yard has from time to time charged himself with certain considerable surpluses, arising from too great an allowance for waste in dressing the Hemp. As the cargoes of Hemp, on receipt, are kept separate, and as it is usual to expend one cargo before another is begun upon, we think the clerk of the Rope Yard should from time to time charge himself with the surplus on each cargo, instead of debiting himself at the end of every two or three years, or a more distant period, with the surplus quantity in store above that upon his charge. In the course of our enquiries at Woolwich, we found that it was not usual in that Yard to give the contractors credit for the exact quantity of Hemp delivered. We therefore called upon the officers of the several Yards to know if any, and what allowances had been made for the draught of the scale on the receipt of stores, and whether any alteration had taken place in consequence of the allowance made by the officers of the customs having been abolished. From their replies we learned, that no alteration had been made, and that the practice at the several Yards differed. No reason can be given for the present inconsistent practice of the several Yards; and as the allowance made by the Customs to the merchant has been discontinued, we think that none should be required from the contractors. Considerable quantities of Hemp were supplied, during the late war, by persons employed by the Navy Board to purchase that article upon commission; and by the evidence of the clerk of the Rope Yard, and master rope-maker, much of it appears to have been damaged, and of so inferior a quality, that it would not have been received from Contractors. Since our return to town, we have paid some attention to the investigation of this business, and shall make it the subject of a separate Report.</p>

<title>IRON.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01851">In order to examine and check the receipt of this article, we pursued the same method as with the Hemp. We required of the officers of the Dock Yard an Account of the Quantities which the contractors had been paid for between the years 1790 and 1802, specifying the ships from which they had been received. We experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining this account, owing to the Yard-officers not having registered the names of the ships. Recourse was therefore had by them to a book, kept in a very loose and incorrect manner by the boatswain of the Yard, of the employment of the labourers, and to the contractor's agent residing in the neighbourhood. Having received the best account that could thus be furnished of the names of the ships, we applied to the officers of the customs for an account of the Iron imported by them. On comparing these Accounts, we found that the quantities paid for exceeded those reported by the Custom House officers to have been landed in the Dock Yard, in about the same proportion as the Hemp; and the difference is to be attributed to the same cause, the allowance made by the Customs for the draught of the scale. In order to prevent similar difficulty, and to facilitate enquiry in case of suspicion of fraud or collusion, we recommend that the names of the ships bringing stores to the Yard be entered in the respective receipt-books kept by the officers. The Iron wanted for the service of the Yard is delivered by the storekeeper to the master smith, when demanded, generally in quantities of two tons at a time, of which the storekeeper is acquitted, and it remains hi the charge of the master smith until it is manufactured. No account was formerly taken of the expenditure of iron; but the master smith has, for about two years, by direction of the present master shipwright, kept an account of the iron received and expended, which is balanced monthly. The waste in the manufacture of iron is very uncertain. The iron is at present weighed by the master smith as it is delivered to the workmen, and the difference between such weight, and the weight of the articles manufactured, is set off in his account as wastage. The old iron, as it accumulates, is examined by the master smith, who gives a receipt to the storekeeper for the weight of such articles as may be fit to be re-manufactured;
<col>1132</col>
but he does cot charge himself therewith. On the appointment of the present storekeeper, in April 1802, the estimated quantity of old Iron was 200 tons, and about the same quantity still remains in the custody of the master smith. As there is a stipulation in the contract for the supply of ironmongery goods, that the contractor shall take such old Iron as may arise at a certain price per ton, we think it would be more advantageous to the public to reserve such quantities only as there may be a reasonable probability of converting, instead of allowing it to accumulate to so great an extent.</p>

<title>COALS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01852">The Coals required for the use of the Dock yards are supplied under contracts made annually by the Navy Board for specific quantities. There are clauses in the contracts by which it is agreed, that the coals shall be measured by the vat, and that if it should become necessary to purchase Coals at an advanced price, owing to their not being delivered at the times specified, the contractors shall pay the difference of price. The latter clause is made a part of other contracts, and we think it should form a part of all, as we conceive it would act more forcibly to the fulfilling of contracts, than any reasonable penalty that can be attached to the non-performance of them.&#x2014;Coals are sold and shipped at Newcastle, Sunderland, and Blyth, by the chaldron, neighing 53 cwt. It is impossible to ascertain with precision the number of chaldrons, of 36 bushels, which each cargo, when delivered, ought to make out, owing to the difference in the specific gravity of the Coals, and to there being a greater or less quantity of large or small Coal in the cargo; but it has been stated to us by the officers of the Customs at Newcastle, that 8 Newcastle chaldrons, when delivered in the Port of London, have, till within the last 12 months, made out nearly double, and since that time about 15, London chaldrons; and that the same quantity when delivered in most of the Out-ports, makes out about 16 chaldrons, and sometimes more.&#x2014;The deliveries in the Dock Yards should bear the same proportion to the Newcastle chaldron as those made on the River Thames, as they are alike measured by the vat; for although there is an allowance to the buyer in the Port of London, of one chaldron upon 20, called in-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0581"/>
<col>1133</col>
grain, yet the duty is paid upon the actual quantity delivered, including that allowance.&#x2014;The proportion of the Newcastle to the London chaldron, in calculating the export duly, is taken as 11 to 21; but in the observations we shall have to make on the deliveries in Plymouth Yard, we shall consider the Newcastle to be double the London chaldron.&#x2014;On the 27th of June 1803, the officers of the Customs at Newcastle stated to the Commissioners of the Customs, that the ship Henley of London, F. Watson, master, has been cocketed on the 4th of Slay for 112 chaldrons, and that it appeared by a certificate produced to them, dated the 26th, that she had delivered her cargo at Plymouth, and had made out there from 288 chaldrons 4 bushels; on which they observed, if the cargo had been delivered at that quantity into his majesty's Stores, they did not hesitate to say, "that though the revenue has been "benefited by the duties on between 50 "and 60 chaldrons, the public purse has "been shamefully defrauded in the price "on the same quantity."&#x2014;This letter, which is very creditable to the public spirit of the writers of it, was transmitted by the secretary of the Customs to the Navy Board, and forwarded by them to Commissioner Fanshawe, with directions to enquire into all the circumstances respecting the delivery and measurement.&#x2014;There is a remarkable coincidence in the discovery of this apparent fraudulent transaction; for, previous to the Navy Board's communication to Commissioner Fanshawe, the Ship Henley had returned to Plymouth, and was again discharging her cargo at the Dock Yard, and the master shipwright had noticed that the vat by which the Coals were measured was not sufficiently filled; and several of the smiths, who, from the situation of their shop, had it in their power to observe how the Coals were measured, had represented to the officers certain improper practices in measuring the cargo then delivering, and also in measuring that delivered by the same ship in Way.&#x2014;This circumstance having happened a few weeks before our arrival at Plymouth, we thought it proper to enter upon the investigation of the receipt of this article, by an enquiry into the case which had so recently occurred, and proceeded to examine the smiths, by whose evidence it appears, that in measuring the Coals received from the ship Henley in May and July 1803, the vat was not properly tilled, as it would have held,
<col>1134</col>
according to their different judgments, from half a bushel to a bushel more, and that when the vat was turned over from the contractor's to the King's Heap, instead of clearing it out, about the same quantity of Coals was left in the bottom of it, by which it would appear that on each vat, which should have contained 9 bushels, or &#x00BC; of a chaldron, there was a deficiency of from one to two bushels.&#x2014;In confirmation of the evidence given by the smiths, it will be seen, by reducing 224 chaldrons, being double the number contained in the cocket, into bushels, and dividing it by 288, the number of chaldrons paid for, and slated to have been delivered from the cargo in May, that each chaldron delivered contained only 28 bushels, and that consequently the deficiency in each vat was exactly two bushels. Pursuing the same method with the cargo delivered in July, it appears, that each chaldron then delivered, upon an Average, contained rather more than 30 bushels, and consequently that the deficiency on each vat was about a bushel and a half.&#x2014;It is stated by the smiths, that the Custom House meter and the clerks to the clerk of the checque, storekeeper, and clerk of the survey, whose duty it was to attend the receipt and measurement of the Coals, generally stood in the doorway of the master smith's cabin, being at the distance of from 20 to 40 feet from the place where the Coals were measured, and that they could not from thence see that the vat was properly tilled; but that at times they stood nearer the vat.&#x2014;The clerks, who had all been lately entered in the Yard, and had not been much accustomed to measuring Coals, agree with the smiths as to the vat's not being properly filled, and state that the Coals in the vat, at the highest part, were not more than From one to six inches above its sides, instead of their being heaped to a cone, But it is stated by them, in contradiction to the smiths, that the vat was completely emptied on its being turned over from the Contractor's to the King's Heap, and that they generally stood near the place where the Coals were measuring, except in bad weather, when they retired to the doorway of the master smith's cabin.&#x2014;It is stated by the storekeeper, that he attended the receipt of Coals alternately with the clerk of the checque and clerk of the survey; that in May 1803, he had frequent conversations with the meter about filling the vat, who resisted, its being heaped to a
<image src="S1V0003P0I0582"/>

cone, and stated, that it had not been the practice, either in or out of the Dock Yard, to measure Coals in that manner; that the measure given was proper; and that he was the umpire between the buyer and the seller.&#x2014;After the discovery of the improper practices in measuring the cargo delivered in July, the officers of the Yard determined to receive such Coals only as were measured by heaping the vat to a cone.&#x2014;One of the meters informed the storekeeper, that he was paid by the merchant or master of the vessel, according to the number of chaldrons the cargo might turn out, 4d. per chaldron if he worked, and 2d. per chaldron when the Coals were delivered in the Dock Yard, where he did not work. It would therefore appear that his interest was at variance with his duty, as in proportion as the measure given was less than it ought to have been, the greater would be his emolument.&#x2014;Some doubts were entertained by the Officers of the Yard as to the vat's being of proper dimensions; indeed, they represented to the commissioner, that when filled in the customary manner, it would contain only 8 bushels; but on its being measured by our desire, in the presence of the Comptroller of the Customs and the Clerk of the Survey, it was found, when properly heaped, to contain exactly 9 bushels, and we find by the dimensions of the vat, that it is similar to those made use of in the Port of London.&#x2014;It is stated by the Comptroller of the customs, that all Coals and Culm are directed by the 12th of Ann, cap. 17. to be sold, measured, and the duties paid by the chaldron containing 36 bushels; that the officers of the Customs had observed that the excess of the cargoes of the same vessels beyond double the quantity contained in their cockets had been greater when delivered at the Dock Yard than at other places; that they had not enquired into the circumstances, as their attention was directed to cases where there was reason to suppose the revenue had been defrauded; that of 32 vessels discharged of Coals in Michaelmas quarter 1803, the cargoes of 27 had been equal to, or exceeded, double the quantity contained in their cockets, and the cargoes of the other five had fallen short of that quantity.&#x2014;In order to ascertain the extent of the Abuse which had been practised in measuring the Coals, we called upon the officers of the Yard for an Account of the Quantities received since
<col>1136</col>
the 1st of Jan. 1790, and requested the Commissioners of the Customs, to give directions to their officers at Plymouth to furnish us with au Account of the Quantities landed in the Dock Yard from the same period, specifying the cocketed quantities of the respective ships, and the quantities delivered from them, on which the duly had been paid. By these accounts it appears that the abuse in measuring the Coals has latterly increased very much.&#x2014;It appears by the letters from the officers of the Customs at Newcastle, that the Ship Henley delivered from Oct. 1802 to Feb. 1803, 4 cargoes of Coals in the River Thames; that each cargo was cocketed at 111 chaldrons; and that, upon an average, she delivered rather less than double that uumber.&#x2014;Taking it for granted that the quantity delivered should be equal to double the quantity cocketed, it appears, that Coals were delivered at Plymouth Yard, on an average, during the first 5 years of the Account, at the rate of 31&#x00BD; bushels to the chaldron; in 1802 at rather more than 29&#x00BD;, and in May 1803 at the rate of 28 bushels only to the chaldron. This circumstance may account for the attention of the officers of the Customs at Newcastle, that of the officers of the Yard, and of the smiths, being directed about the same time to the improper practices in measuring the Coals.&#x2014;It also appears by the same Account, that the sums paid for the excess of the several cargoes above double the quantity contained in the Cockets of the Ships, amounted to 2,5761. 11s. 8d. being about 12&#x00BD; per cent. upon the whole sum paid.&#x2014;Had Messrs. Henley and Son been paid for the cargo delivered by them in May 1803, as double the quantity contained in the cocket of their ship, it would have amounted to 4221. 16s.; but as they were paid for 288 chaldrons four bushels, amounting to 543l. 16s. 2d. the difference, 121l. Os. 2d. being equal to an encrease of 28l. 12s. 4d. per cent. on the price, arose in the whol, or at least in the greater part, from improper measurement.&#x2014;The Horta, the first ship that delivered her cargo at the Dock Yard after the discovery of the abuse before stated, was cocketed at 88 chaldrons, which made out on delivery 152 chaldrons 15 bushels, and the contractor was paid 342l. 18s. 9d, being at the rate of 2l. 5s. per chaldron; but if her cargo had been measured and paid for in the same manner as that delivered by Messrs. Henley and Son, in May 1803, it would have amounted
<image src="S1V0003P0I0583"/>
<col>1137</col>
to 50l. 6s. 3d. and have been equal to all encrease of 48l. 10s. 3d. per cent. upon the price.<lb/>
The Navy Board having made some enquiry into the circumstances of the abuse in the measurement of the coals, called upon Messrs. Henley and Son, the contractors, by letter on the 22d Sept. 1803, to account, for the great excess of the cargoes delivered in May and July above double the quantities contained in the cockets of the ship delivering them.&#x2014;Messrs. Henley and Son, in their reply of the 23d, stated; That the making out of Coal ships differed very much at every Port in England, owing to the mode of measurement, and the tilling of the measure; that the Coals were landed in the Dock Yard, and measured under the inspection of officers of the Yard and a Custom House meter; that Plymouth Dock Yard, in time of peace, has in general been supplied with Pontop Coals from Newcastle, at a lower rate than the Yards in the Port of London; that a Coal voyage from Newcastle to Plymouth is a double voyage; that the officers and seamen are paid double wages; that the insurance is double; and that in general, colliers make two voyages to London in the same time as they would make one to Plymouth: and they concluded by stating, "that in fu-"ture, if Government make a regula-"tion in the measure, the returns per "chaldron making out is to be the same "at Plymouth as at Woolwich, the con-"tractor, be he who he may, must have "a higher price for Plymouth than Wool-"wich, to pay his extra charges." An admission in itself sufficiently striking of the impropriety of the measurement.&#x2014;The Navy Board, not being satisfied with the answer of Messrs. Henley and Son, again called on them on the 28th of Sept. 1803, to account for the great excess of the cargoes delivered above double the cocketed quantities; and Mr. Joseph Henley, in his answer of the 11th of Oct. stated, that he had made every enquiry in his power. and found his letter of the 23d ult. explained all he knew of the business, "just and true;" and hoped the Navy Board would order his bill according to his agreement.&#x2014;We shall now proceed to observe on Messrs. Henley and Son's reply to the Navy Board of the 23d of Sept. It is true the proportion which the quantity o Coals delivered may bear to the quantity shipped, may differ in every Port in Eng
<col>1138</col>
land; but we apprehend Messrs. Henley and Son, at the time of making their contracts with the Navy Board, must have understood that they were to deliver legal measure, consisting of 36 bushels to the chaldron; certainly they could not have understood by the contracts that they were to deliver less than the customary measure in the Port of Plymouth, which we proved to have been 35 bushels in Michaelmas quarter 1803, about which period they delivered at the Dock Yard at the rate of 28 bushels; and the average of all their deliveries from 1790 to 1803, has very little exceeded 31 bushels to the chaldron, during which time the excesses of the several cargoes delivered by them above double the quantity contained in the cockets, have amounted to 855 chaldron sixteen bushels, which, at the contract price of the years in which they occurred, is equal to 1,470l. 16s. 3d.&#x2014;It is also true that the Coals have been measured, or have been supposed to be measured, under the inspection of the officers and clerks of the Yard; but if, from collusion or inattention, they have suffered them to be measured improperly, we apprehend Messrs. Henley and Son are not entitled, either by law or equity, to be paid for a greater quantity than they actually delivered.&#x2014;It is true likewise that Plymouth Yard has, in time of peace, been supplied with coals at a cheaper rate than the Yards in the River Thames, notwithstanding the increased expences arising from the voyage to Plymouth being considered double; but we apprehend that circumstance is attributable to the additional duty and other increased charges in the Port of London: at any rate, we apprehend Messrs Henley and Son can take nothing by the preceding or their concluding observation, as it appears by the Account of Coals purchased for the Royal Hospital at Plymouth, that the price paid for Coals purchased on the spot, on an average of each year from 1790 to 1803 inclusive, was only 1l. 13s. 1&#x00BD;d. per chaldron, whereas the average contract price for the Dock Yard, during the same period, was 1l. 16s. 9d.; and we apprehend there cannot be a doubt that contractors can afford to sell at least as cheap as those who import to supply a fluctuating market by retail. On a review of this case, we feel ourselves called upon to say, that there has been at least great inattention to the measurement of the coals, by which the public appear
<image src="S1V0003P0I0584"/>
<col>1139</col>
to have suffered to some extent: an attention on the part of the officers to the cocketed quantities, and a vigilant discharge of their duty, can alone prevent the recurrence of the abuse.</p>

<title>PAINT WORK.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01853">The Paint Work, until lately, was performed by contract, and nearly the same regulations were established with respect to the accounts of the work as were directed to be observed in the receipts of stores. The Navy Board having revised the mode of taking and keeping the accounts of Paint Work, directed by their Warrant of the 1st of June 1781, that four clerks should in general attend the measurement, but never less than three; that the foreman afloat, or master workmen in their respective branches, should constantly attend the measures, to certify what part of the work had been once, twice, or thrice painted: that the accounts of the work, when measured, should be immediately entered by each clerk in a separate book, and afterwards in books to be kept at the offices of the master shipwright, clerk of the checque, storekeeper, and clerk of the survey. The officers were particularly directed not to suffer the Paint Work to be measured without the attendance of the foreman afloat and master workmen; and they were also strictly charged not to suffer any bills to be made out to the contractor in payment unless it appeared, that all the books before-mentioned had been duly kept in the respective offices, and that they exactly agreed with each other. Notwithstanding these positive directions, the whole of the regulations they were intended to enforce appear to have been very generally neglected during the late war. It is stated in the evidence of the measurers who were selected from among the shipwrights, the one on the part of the master shipwright, the other on the part of the clerk of the checque, that the clerks very seldom attended, and that consequently the taking of the account of the work devolved upon them; that instead of the foreman afloat and master workmen attending to certify the number of times the work had been painted, they relied on the word of the foreman of the painters, a servant of the contractor; that when the contractor's foreman gave in accounts of trifling articles, they not only took his word for the number of times the articles might have been painted, but also for the quantity of work. From these circumstances
<col>1140</col>
it will appear, the clerks, from their non-attendance were in general obliged to make out bills to the contractor from the accounts taken by the measurers; and it will be seen by the report of the committee of the Navy Board, that the clerks did not even take the trouble to copy those accounts into the books directed to be kept in the respective offices. By the general neglect of the officers and clerks, the sums paid for paint work, which, during the late war, amounted on an average to 9,436l. 17s. 4d. a year in this Yard, were generally disbursed on the faith of the measurers, whose established rate of pay was only 2s. 6d. a day; but it appears they were paid by the contractor from 12 to 14l. a year each, which, during the late war, was increased to 20l. The intention of the Navy Board in directing the attendance of so many persons as checks upon each other was wholly defeated, as the contractor's servant, the foreman of the painters, was in general employed to measure the work, and the account was taken by one measurer only. How far such practice may have been productive of abuse it is impossible to say; but it would appear the whole very much depended on the honesty of the contractor's foreman, whose word was taken as to the number of times the work was painted, and, in some instances, as to the quantity of work performed, without its being even inspected by the persons appointed by the Navy Board. When the committee of the Navy Board, in Feb. 1802, enquired into the mode of conducting the business of the Paint Work, the several officers who had failed in their duty were directed to state what they had to offer in vindication of their conduct. It was urged by one of the foremen afloat, the master, joiner, and the master house-carpenter, that they were wholly unacquainted with its being a part of their duty to attend the measurement of Paint Work. This circumstance strongly points out the necessity of the subordinate officers of the Dock Yards having instructions as to the general outline of their duty.</p>

<title>CONTRACTS IN THE YARD.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01854">The Contracts carried on in this Dock Yard, besides those for the erection and repairs of buildings, are for Oar-making, Treenail Mooting, Carvers, Paviors, Tinman's and Glazier's Work: the contractors for the three latter branches find their own materials. The Repairs performed by the
<image src="S1V0003P0I0585"/>
<col>1141</col>
Tinman are said to be of so trifling a nature, that it is very difficult to take account of the work either before or after it has been performed, the contractor or his servants only being able to point it out. The materials used by the Glazier and Tinman, such as sheet copper, tin, lead, and solder, are in general use in the Dock Yard; these articles are frequently attempted to be embezzled; and it being almost impossible to prevent their being carried to the shops of the contractors in the Yard, should they be disposed to receive them, we agree in opinion with the officers, that such works as are carried on in the Yard by those branches which consist mostly in repairs, had better be performed by persons entered in the Yard for the purpose: indeed, the branches of the plumber and brazier, which are usually joined to those trades, are already carried on by persons entered in the Yard. A part of the work usually performed by the Contractor, the tinning of the galleys and light rooms of his majesty's ships to prevent accidents by fire, has, by direction of the master shipwright, been latterly performed by the artificers of the Yard. The other Contracts are not liable to the objections before stated; but we are of opinion those for oar-making, and treenail mooting might be made a joint branch, and be carried on with advantage to the public by the old and infirm shipwrights of the Yard, under the direction of an oar-maker, who might have an apprentice or two to be brought up exclusively to the business.</p>

<title>SALE OF OLD STORES.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01855">The old stores, as they accumulate beyond the quantities wanted for conversion, and for inferior purposes, are, on application of the storekeeper to the commissioner, made up into lots for sale, in quantities that may best suit the convenience of the purchasers. It has been understood that great irregularities were formerly practised in the making up, and in delivering the lots of old stores; but the whole of the business at present is stated to be conducted with much care and attention. The Navy Board, in the year 1747, directed the old rope about to be sold to be cut into lengths of 20 fathoms; latterly it has been cut into lengths of 3 feet; although this practice renders the old cordage less productive at the time of sale, yet, as it is intended to check embezzlement by depriving those in whose possession King's cordage may be found,
<col>1142</col>
of all plea, and to facilitate the proof of embezzlement in prosecutions, which have been very frequent, we think the present practice more advantageous to the public than the former. An allowance of 28lb. per ton is made to the purchasers of old lead, iron, and cordage, for the draught of the scale, and 14lb. on other articles. We think all allowances of this sort should be done away, as the making of them is productive of trouble, and liable to error, and cannot be attended with any advantage to the purchaser unless abused, as he will of course regulate the price he may bid by the weight he is to receive.</p>

<title>GENERAL REMARKS.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01856">Having finished the Observations we had to make under the proposed heads, we shall now offer such General Remarks as have occurred to us.&#x2014;The mode of accounting for the Stores in the department of the clerk of the Rope Yard, is very loose and unsatisfactory. The only Account kept by that officer is a Progress Book, in which is entered the number of persons, of the different classes, at work each day, the mode of their employment, the articles manufactured, and the quantity of hemp, received and expended. This account is balanced weekly, and a very confused Report to the Navy Board made out therefrom, containing an account of the expence and remains of hemp, and of the articles which have been manufactured within the week.&#x2014;No notice is taken in the Progress Book, or in the weekly Report to the Navy Board, of the expenditure of various articles received from the storekeeper, and used in the manufacture of cordage, such as tallow, tram oil, and a variety of others, to a considerable amount.&#x2014;Very large issues are likewise made by the storekeeper to the clerk of the Rope Yard, of old cordage and junk, to be re-manufactured; these articles are not delivered by weight, but the quantity is estimated, and the storekeeper discharges himself accordingly. No receipt is given by the clerk of the Rope Yard for the quantity received by him, nor does he charge himself therewith. The articles manufactured from the old cordage and junk are entered in the Progress Book, but so blended with those made from hemp, as to render the whole very confused.&#x2014;We are of opinion, that the accounts of the re-manufactured Cordage, and of that made from hemp, should be kept perfectly distinct from each other, and that the clerk
<image src="S1V0003P0I0586"/>
<col>1143</col>
of the Rope Yard should debit himself with all the articles received from the storekeeper, and account for their expen-penditure.&#x2014;The Cables and Cordage manufactured are delivered over to the charge of the storekeeper; formerly no accounts were sent with them, but the present storekeeper has required notes from the master ropemaker of the particulars of each delivery. He applied likewise to the clerk of the Rope Yard, to be furnished monthly with an account of the articles delivered aver to his charge, in order to check his receipts; but this was refused by the latter officers, and the storekeeper has in consequence employed one of his own clerks to extract such account from the clerk of the Rope Yard's books. We are of opinion that no article should pass from the charge Of one department in a Dock Yard to another without a note, answering to a bill of parcels; and that, in conformity to this rule, the clerk of the Rope Yard should accompany his deliveries of Cordage to the storekeeper with an account, signed by himself or principal clerk, and that he should also furnish the storekeeper with a monthly abstract of his deliveries. In the beginning of tins Report we stated that the Accounts of the Dock Yard, particularly in the storekeeper's department, were very much in arrear; this us well as other irregularities in conducting the business of the Yard, may in a great measure be attributed to violent dissentions between the storekeeper and the master shipwright, clerk of the survey, and one of the masters attendant.&#x2014;These disagreements were first publicly made known to the Navy Hoard in the month of Jan. 1798, from which time till June 1800, numerous letters were written by the officers to the commissioner and to the Navy Board, charging each other with improper practices and neglect of duty, and detailing their quarrels, in the course of which they made use of very gross and abusive language in the presence of the workmen, much to the prejudice of the discipline and good order of the Yard.&#x2014;In consequence of a letter from the storekeeper to the commissioner, dated the 14th of Dec. 1798, complaining of the conduct of the other officers, winch was transmitted to the Lords of the Admiralty, an enquiry was directed to be made by the commissioner. The examinations taken by him, with other papers relating to the subject mailer of the complaint, were laid before the lordships by the Navy Board on the 15th of March 1799.&#x2014;Notwith-
<col>1144</col>
standing this enquiry, the dissentions among the officers continued, and their letters, containing reciprocal complaints, were transmitted to the Navy Board, who from time to time wrote to the commissioner, desiring he would inform the officers that their conduct was highly injurious to the public service, and, it persevered in. would subject them to very disagreeable consequences. In June 1800, inconsequence of information given by a person who had been foreman of the Storehouse Labourers, but who was then under sentence of transportation for the Embezzlement of Stores, accusing the pincers of various improper practices, a committee of the Navy Board was sent to Plymouth to investigate fully the circumstances alleged in the information. They were also directed to make enquiry into the disputes and reciprocal complaints of the officers, for which purpose the various letters and papers on the subject were delivered to them. Instead of investigating the specific charges made by the officers against each other, they consented to bury in oblivion all that had passed, and only required an assurance from the officers, that it was their full determination to carry on the duties of their respective departments to the best of their abilities, and that no personal prejudices should influence their public conduct: notwithstanding this assurance, the want of cordiality afterwards appeared.&#x2014;The dissensions between the officers, which were carried on with great virulence and asperity, and which must have been productive of much hindrance and injury to the public service, called loudly on the Navy Board for prompt and effectual measures to prevent their continuance for so great a length of time.&#x2014;Upon an attentive consideration of all the circumstances which have come to our knowledge in the course of our investigation into the mode of conducting the business of the Dock Yards, we are of opinion that the duties allotted to the respective officers are not so regulated as to produce the greatest possible advantage from their exertion. The various checks imposed upon almost every transaction, however trifling, in the Dock Yards, add greatly to the business without affording that security to the public intended by their establishment; for in every department to which our enquiries have been directed, it has appeared that the accounts have seldom been taken by more than two persons, frequently by one; and that the other ac-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0587"/>
<col>1145</col>
counts intended as checks have been merely copies. We therefore feel ourselves justified in drawing the conclusion, that the nominal and unnecessary multiplication of checks is disadvantageous to the public; inasmuch as it lessens the responsibility of those who have actually been employed in taking the accounts. In the receipt of Stores, it appears to us that two persons are fully sufficient to guard against error, and that an account kept by officers of a separate department would be a more effectual check against collusion, than requiring the attendance of additional persons belonging to the Dock Yards. As the officers of the Customs take account of the most important articles landed in the Dock Yards, for the purpose of collecting the duties, we are of opinion they should be directed to transmit copies of those accounts to the resident commissioners, and that such copies should be compared with the certificates given by the officers of the Yards, of the Stores received, previous to the commissioners affixing their signatures thereto. The correct receipt of the articles, of which the officers of the Customs do not take account, we conceive would be more effectually secured by the enforced and regular attendance of two clerks, than by the nominal attendance of a greater number. Should the suggestion we have made he adopted, we recommend that the clerk of the checque be relieved from attending the receipt of Stores, ill order that the whole of his attention, as well as that of his clerks, may be directed to the mustering and checking the wages of the workmen, and to the other important duties attached to his office. The certificates of stores received from contractors, now made out by the clerk of the checque, we are of opinion, should in future be made out and signed by the clerk of the survey; and after being examined and signed by the storekeeper, that the master shipwright and master's attendant should certify thereon, as at present, the quality of the stores. The duties allotted to the clerk of the Rope Yard, which partake of the nature of storekeeper and clerk of the checque, are very trifling when compared with those imposed on the other officers, and the office seems to have been established rather for the sake of preventing additional business being attached to the clerk of the checque and storekeeper, than from the necessity of establishing a separate officer for keeping the accounts of the Hope Yard department. As by the regulation we
<col>1146</col>
have suggested, the clerk of the checque would be relieved from a considerable portion of duty now performed by him, we think he should not only muster and check the wages of the workmen of the Dock Yard, but of the Rope Yard also; and as it appears to us that the charge of the storekeeper in the principal Yard is so great and multifarious as to do away all idea of personal responsibility, except in cases of gross neglect or misconduct, and that the business attached to the office is more than one person can superintend and control with effect, we therefore think it would be advantageous that there should be two storekeepers, which the arrangement we have proposed would admit of, without encreasing the establishment, by abolishing the office of clerk of the Rope Yard, and making that officer one of the storekeepers. The nature of the stores points out the allotment which might be made of the duties of these officers; one might have charge of the timber and all carpenter's stores, and the other of hemp, tar, and all boatswain's stores. By such division of the duties of the storekeeper, we think much order and regularity might be expected; the officers would of course be better acquainted with the remains of each article in store, more timely supplies would be thereby insured, surveys of the remains of stores might more easily be taken, and the accounts or" the storekeepers more regularly balanced. The making up of accounts which have been suffered to run 5 or 6 years in arrear, as in the instance of the late storekeeper, without expecting the officer to be amenable for the deficiencies, may satisfy those who are contented with forms; but we conceive, can answer no useful purpose. The officers charged with stores in the naval service are not allowed to receive their pay until their accounts have been examined and approved, by which it becomes their interest as well as their duty to keep them with regularity. We think this principle should be applied to the officers of the Dock Yards, and that they should not be suffered to receive their pay if their accounts should be more than a year in arrear, unless reasonable cause should be shewn to and approved by the Navy Board. When demands are made for stores, we think it may be right, as at present, that they should in the first instance be examined and approved by the master shipwright and master's attendant; in their respective departments; but we
<image src="S1V0003P0I0588"/>
<col>1147</col>
can see ho reason why the warrants and notes given by the clerk of the survey for the issue of stores should be countersigned by those officers, as it must be taking up their time unnecessarily, and be productive of delay. We are of opinion it would be advantageous to the public service, particularly in the winter season, if the clerks attached to the storehouses and storehouse labourers, were to attend to issue stores from half past 8 o'clock in the morning till 3 in the afternoon, as, by the present practice of allowing them an hour for breakfast, and an hour and a half for dinner, much of the best part of the day is lost. By this regulation, we conceive, the frequent loss of men from the boats of his majesty's ships would be prevented, as well as the embezzlement of stores, inasmuch as the storehouses might be secured, and the boats return to their ships by day-light; whereas, from the circumstance of the boats crews having nothing to do during the Yard dinner-time, thay frequently get intoxicated; and from their remaining on shore till dark, the boats are often prevented from getting on board their ships till the following day.&#x2014;The time which we have been able to devote to the subject of the Dock Yards will not allow of our entering upon a minute arrangement of the business of the several departments; but we are of opinion it is a subject highly deserving the serious attention of the Navy Board. In drawing up regulations and instructions for the several officers, particular attention should be had not to augment their business unnecessarily, nor to impose a greater portion of duty upon any individual than he can be reasonably expected to perform.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01860">In pursuance of the duty imposed on us by the 43d of his present maj. c. 16, "to examine into and investigate all such corrupt and fraudulent Practices, Irregularities, Frauds, and Abuses, or other Misconduct, as might be found to have existed or to exist in any of the several offices or departments thereinafter mentioned, or to have been practised or committed by any person or persons that then were or had been concerned in managing, conducting, or transacting the business thereof respectively, or employed in any manner therein; we issued our precepts to the Treasurer of the Navy, for an account of the state and disposition of the balance of public money, with which he stood charged on the 31st of Dec. in each year from 1786 to 1802 inclusively; that we might judge of the propriety of the balances of public money left in his hands, and see whether the balances unappropriated to the public service at those periods, were in the Bank of England, as required by the 25th of his maj. c. 31.

<col>1149</col>
conduct of the different Treasurers under such regulations.&#x2014;The attention of the commissioners for taking and stating the public accounts of the kingdom was particularly directed to this department. By their 3d Report, of the 6th of March 1781, it appears, that large sums of money were constantly in the hands of the Treasurer of the Navy; that upon his quitting office he kept possession of the balance with which he was at that time charged, and continued to make payments to the officers and seamen of the fleet, upon such Ships' Books as were opened during his Treasurership, and on such assignments as might be directed by the Public Boards, until his accounts were finally made up; this seldom took place till many years after his quitting office, and, during that period, he had the use of the public money in his hands. At the time of making that Report there were live Ex-Treasurers; the sums in their possession amounted to 104,405l. 4s. 6&#x00BD;d. and at the head of the list stood a defaulter in the sum of 27,611l. 6s. 5&#x00BC;d. whose final account was dated so far back as the 4th of April 1689. Several wise measures were proposed by these commissioners to remedy the inconveniences, and prevent the losses to which the public was subject from the then mode of conducting the business of the Navy Pay Office; and most of the subsequent Regulations were grounded upon them.&#x2014;On the 18th of June 1782, the House of Commons, in a committee, took into consideration the Reports made by the said Commissioners; and among other Resolutions, came to the following "That it is the opinion of this committee, that from henceforward the Paymaster General of his Maj.'s Land Forces, and the Treasurer of the Navy for the time being, shall not apply any sum or sums of money imprested to them, or either of them, to any purpose of advantage or interest to themselves, either directly or indirectly." On the next day this Resolution was agreed to by the house.&#x2014;In furtherance of the intention of the House of Commons, we find that his maj. on the 26th of the same month, directed, by Warrant under his sign manual, that the salary of the Treasurer of the Navy, being at that time 2,000l. reduced by Taxes and other charges to 1,850l. should be increased, by an additional allowance of 2,150l.; that his annual income in future might amount to the
<col>1150</col>
sum of 4,000l. in full satisfaction of all wages and fees, and other profits and emoluments, theretofore enjoyed by former Treasurers.&#x2014;The same Commissioners, in, their 8th Report, of the 20th of Dec. 1782, respecting the then mode of passing the Accounts of the Treasurer of the Navy in the Office of the Auditors of the Imprest, state that their examination on that subject has enabled them to form an opinion upon another point of moment to the public, which opinion we shall give in their own words:&#x2014;"The legislature have introduced into the Office of the Paymaster General of the Forces a regulation, which, as it seems to us, may be applied as beneficially to the office of the Treasurer of the Navy, The custody of tire cash applicable to the Navy Services may be transferred from the Treasurer to the Bank of England, and the Account only of the receipts and payments be kept in his office; all the sums now received by him may be received at the Bank; sums from the Exchequer may be imprested to the, Bank; sums directed by the letters of the different Boards to be paid to him, may be directed to be paid into the Bank; all bills assigned upon him for payment may be paid, and all extra payments may be made by his drafts upon the Bank; the payment of the seamen, the artificers and labourers in the Yards, and the persons in the Hospital ships, and on the half-pay lists, must be carried on in the same manner it is now; These men cannot be paid by drafts; they must have cash, and with that cash the pay clerks must be entrusted as they are at present; and the Treasurer must continue to be responsible for them. as for officers of his appointment, and under his control; but this will be no obstruction to the Regulation. The money may be all issued to the pay clerks by the drafts of the Treasurer upon the, Bank, according to the requisitions of the Navy Board, in like manner as many of these sums are issued at this day; and, upon the death or resignation of a Treasure, the balances of his cash in the bank, and in the hands of his pay clerks, may be struck immediately, and carried over to the account of his successor. In this situation, the Treasurer, neither receiving nor paying public money himself, can be neither debtor to, "nor creditor of the public, except as far
<image src="S1V0003P0I0590"/>
<col>1151</col>
as he may be responsible for his clerks. On passing his accounts, the bill indorsed or requisition of the Navy Board, is both his authority and voucher for his draft; the draft indorsed is the voucher for the Bank to prove their payment. If these accounts agree (and they ought frequently to be compared together) it is highly probable that they are both right." We are not aware of any measures taken by parliament on this report until 1785, when an act was passed (25 G. III. c. 31.) intituled "An Act for better regulating the "Office of the Treasurer of His Maj.'s "Navy," which directed that from and after the 1st of July 1785, all monies for the service of the Navy should be issued from the exchequer to the governor and co. of the Bank of England, in like manner as they had been theretofore issued to the Treasurer of the Navy: that all such monies so issued, should be placed on an account or accounts to be raised in the books of the Bank of England, to to be entitled "The Account of the "Treasurer of His Majesty's Navy," inserting the name of such Treasurer for the time being for the Pay Branch, Cashiers Branch, and the Victualling Branch; and that no money for the service of the Navy should be issued from his maj.s exchequer to the Treasurer of the Navy, or should be placed or directed to be placed in his hands or possession. 2. That no monies should be paid out of the Bank but for Navy Services, and in pursuance of drafts drawn by the treasurer, or persons in his office duly authorized by him, in which drafts should be specified the heads of service to which the sums therein mentioned were to be applied. 3. That on the death, resignation, or removal of a Treasurer, the balance of cash for which he should at that time have credit in his accounts with the Bank of England, and also the balances of cash in the hands of the pay clerks at the several out-ports, should vest in his successor, and be transferred and placed to the account or accounts of such successor. 4. That the Treasurer of the Navy should cause to be made up to the 31st Dec. in each year, an Annual account of the navy and victualling services, to be transmitted to the auditor or auditors of the imprest, after being examined in the Offices of the Commissioners of the Navy, of the victualling, and of the sick and hurt, and signed by the Commissioners of the Navy. In consequence of
<col>1152</col>
this act, several alterations were judged necessary in the establishment of the Navy Pay office, and a new arrangement thereof was submitted to his maj. by the right hon. Henry Dundas, now lord Melville, at that time treasurer, which was approved, and directed to be carried into effect by an order in council, dated nth Aug. 17S(5. By this order, a separate branch, entituled, the Accountant's Branch, was established for the express purpose of bringing up the old and keeping up the new accounts of the Treasurers of the Navy, agreeably to the suggestions of the Commissioners of Accounts. All fees whatsoever were abolished, except that of the odd pence, which it had been long usual for the clerks to retain as a perquisite upon all payments; and in lieu of the fees so abolished, a general increase was directed in the salaries of the clerks.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01861">The Treasurer of the Navy is appointed by patent; he does not perform in person any of the official duties of his situation, but nominates and appoints the Paymaster, to whom he delegates the whole charge and conduct of the office by a general power of attorney. The other officers and clerks are also nominated by the Treasurer; the Paymaster is liable to be displaced upon the removal or resignation of his principal, but it has not been usual to remove the inferior officers or clerks, except in cases of, misconduct. The Paymaster solicits the Lords of the Treasury for the money necessary for carrying on the services of the Navy, in such sums as he may from time to time be directed to apply for by the Commissioners of the Navy, the Transport, the Victualling, and the Sick and Hurt Boards; and the money for carrying on the payments is transferred by the Paymaster to the cashiers of the Navy and Victualling, the deputy paymaster, and the cashier of Allotments. No payments are made by the Paymaster, except the fees on the issues of money from the Exchequer, and some other contingencies, for which money is advanced to him on his application to the Treasury, in sums of 3,000l. at a time; and it has been stated to us, that such application is never made but when the balance in his hands is reduced below that sum.</p>

His accounts were finally made up in the year 1795.&#x2014;It was during his treasurership that the House of Commons came to the resolution before noticed; and the treasurer's salary was increased to 4,000l. a year, by warrant under his majesty's sign manual. We thought it right to enquire how far the resolution and the increase of salary, upon the conditions contained in the warrant, had been effectual towards presenting the evils which had before existed,&#x2014;Mr. Barr&#x00E9; being dead, we applied to H.

<title>THE FIRST TREASURERSHIP OF THE RIGHT HON. H. DUNDAS, NOW LORD MELVILLE.</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01863"><member>Lord Melville</member><membercontribution> succeeded Mr. Barr&#x00E9; as Treasurer of the Navy; he held the office from the 19th Aug. 1782 to the 19th of April 1783, and at present stands upon the list of ex-treasurers. His final account was made up in the office of the treasurer of the navy, in the beginning of 1804; the general statement of it was then transmitted to his lordship to attest, but it has not been returned to the accountant, which prevents the account from being delivered
<col>1154</col>
into the auditor's office.&#x2014;Soon after the appointment of lord Melville, a warrant under his maj.s sign manual was given, for granting to him an additional allowance of 2,324l. 6s. 6d. in order to make his net official income 4,000l. a year, which was stated to be, as in the case of Mr. Barr&#x00E9;, "in full satisfaction of all wages and fees, and other profits and emoluments, previously enjoyed by former treasurers.&#x2014;The additional sum of 2,150l. granted to Mr. Barr&#x00E9;, not producing him a net annual income of 4,000l. owing to the taxes and other charges on the additional sum, the grant to lord Melville was therefore increased, and a clause was inserted in the warrant, authorizing him, in case the additional allowance should not make up in each year the net sum of 4,000l. to charge the deficiency in the annual account of monies disbursed by him for fees of divers natures.&#x2014;A warrant, similar to that granted to lord M. has been given on the appointment of each succeeding treasurer.&#x2014;Mr. A. Douglas, who acted as paymaster under lord M., being dead, we had recourse to his lordship for information, whether the conditions of the warrant had been complied with? To the question put to lord M., Whether, during the period of this treasurership, he had derived any profit or advantage from the use or employment of money issued for carrying on the current service of the navy?&#x2014;he objected to answer, under the 5th clause of the act by which we are constituted; which provides, "That no person shall be compellable to answer any question which may criminate, or tend to criminate such person, or to expose such person to any pains or penalties;" and upon the ground of not disclosing delicate and confidential transactions of government, alluded to in his letter to us of the 30th of June 1804. We shall defer the discussion of this objection, as coming more in order when we speak of the 2d part of his 2d treasurership.&#x2014;His lordship having objected to answering this question, and Mr. A. Douglas his paymaster being dead, it was not in our power to pursue this enquiry further; otherwise, we should have thought it our duty to investigate the manner in which the public money had been employed, and the extent to which the use of it had been carried. We however deemed it necessary to ascertain, whether his lordship was aware of the conditions of the warrant, and what construction he put on
<image src="S1V0003P0I0592"/>
<col>1155</col>
hem. By his answer to a question for his purpose, we learned that he certainly lid consider the additional salary granted to him to be in lieu of all wages, fees, profits, and other emoluments, previously enjoyed by former treasurers, excepting only coals, candles, and some such small contingencies. When a treasurer of the Navy has gone out of office, it has been usual to continue to make the payments in his name to the end of the month in which his successor has been appointed, to prevent confusion, and the necessity of making out two accounts for the same month. The payments were therefore continued in lord M.'s name to the 30th April 1783, at which time he stood charged with the sum of 220,446l. 14s. 9&#x00BD;d. We have entered in the Appendix, an account, shewing the amount of the sums received and paid, and the balance with which his lordship was charged on the 31st of Dec. in each year during his Ex-Treasurership; by which it appears, that no payments have been made upon that account since the 31st of Dec. 1795, when the balance was reduced to 5,563l. 6s. 2&#x00BC;d. This balance was paid over to his lordship about the time of his quitting the office of treasurer a second time, in Slay or June 1800.</membercontribution></p>

From the examination of lord B. it appears, that, during the time he held the office of Treasurer, no part of the money issued for the service of the Navy was applied to his use or advantage. His lordship further states, he did not believe that Mr. Douglas, during the time he acted as his paymaster, derived any profit or advantage from the use or employment of the public money, except the money issued for the payment of exchequer fees.

The old mode of account of course ceased on the 31st of Dec. 1785, at which time Lord M. stood charged with 275,820l. 15s. 11d. out of which sum, and others advanced to him, he has continued to make payments as an ex-treasurer. The late Mr. A.

<title>"HIS ACT OF PARLIAMENT NEW ACCOUNT."</title>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01867">The act of the 25th of his present majesty, c. 31. for better regulating the office of the Treasurer of the Navy, directed. That the several provisions therein contained should take place on the 1st of July 1785, but they were not carried into effect till the 1st of Jan. 1786; we understand the delay was occasioned by the necessity of making some previous official arrangements. In that month, Alexander Trotter, esq. who had lately been a clerk in the Navy Pay Office, was appointed paymaster by lord M. and he states, that he acted as deputy to the treasurer in ail the duties attached to the situation, except the appointment of officers and clerks. As the directions of the act are positive, that the issues of money for Navy Services shall be made to the Bank, and that the money shall not be drawn
<image src="S1V0003P0I0593"/>
<col>1157</col>
from thence but for Navy services, it appeared to us, that if the directions of the act had been observed, the circumstance which we have before noticed, that the sums standing in the name of the Treasurer at the Bank were less than Ins unappropriated balances, could not have existed. We therefore deemed it our duty to enquire minutely into the cause of such deficiencies, and with this view, we first examined Mr. Trotter, and afterwards lord M. Mr. T. when first called upon to account for these deficiencies, said he could not precisely explain the cause of them; but afterwards acknowledged, that he had been in the practice of drawing money from the Bank in large sums, and lodging it in the hands of private bankers, previously to its being issued to the sub-accountants for the public service. This practice, he states, was introduced about 1786, with the knowledge and approbation of the treasurer. Lord M. admits that he did permit Mr. T. to lodge the public money in his private banker's hands, but not, as it would seem, to the extent understood by Mr. T. Mr. Trotter, on being questioned, whether he had derived any profit or advantage from the money withdrawn by him from the Bank, refused to answer under the provisions of the 5th clause of the act by which we are constituted; and he availed himself of this clause in every question which bore any relation to the use or employment of the public money, either by himself or lord Melville; urging in the latter case, that as he had drawn all the money from the Bank in the first instance, he conceived himself implicated in its subsequent appropriation. Mr. T. gave us to understand, that money applicable to Navy Services, which had been advanced by him to lord Mi was employed by his lordship in the public service of the state; and that he was led to this conclusion in consequence of a considerable sum, so advanced, having been returned to him by Mr. Long, one of the secretaries to the Treasury. Upon this statement we issued our precept to lord M. for an account of monies received by him, or any person on his account, or by his order, from the paymaster of the Navy, between the 1st of July 1785 and the 31st of Dec. 1800, stating when such monies were received; and also the times when, and the persons by whom, the same were returned to the Bank or the paymaster, In answer to that precept, we received from his lord-
<col>1158</col>
ship the following letter;&#x2014;"Wimbledon, 30th of June 1804. Gentlemen, I have received your requisition, of the 26th inst. It is impossible for me to furnish you with the account you ask. It is more than 4 years since I left the office of Treasurer of the Navy, and at the period of doing so, having accounted for every sum imprested into my hands, I transferred the whole existing balance to the account of my successor. From that time, I never considered any one paper or voucher that remained in my hands as of the smallest use to myself or any other person, and consequently, being often in the practice, since I retired to Scotland, of employing occasionally some time in assorting my papers, and destroying those that were useless, I am satisfied there does not exist any one material by which I could make up such an account as you specify. But independently of that circumstance, I think it right to remind you, that during a great part of the time I was Treasurer of the Navy, I held other very confidential situations in government, and was intimately connected with others. So situated, I did not decline giving occasional accommodation from the funds in the Treasurer's hands to other services, not connected with my official situation as Treasurer of the Navy. If I had materials to make up such an account as you require, I could not do it without disclosing delicate and confidential transactions of government, which my duty to the public must have restrained me from revealing.&#x2014;MELVILLE." Desirous of being furnished with an account of the sums issued to the Bank for the service of the Navy, which had been drawn from thence, and appropriated to any other public service, and judging that some note or record of such transactions, ought to have been preserved in the Navy Pay Office, we issued our precept to the present Treasurer for an account of the sums of money which had been advanced or lent by the Treasurers of the Navy, to any public department, or applied by them to services not connected with their official situation as Treasurers of the Navy, between 1st of Jan. 1786 and 31st Dec. 1803. In answer to which, he informed us, that there were no documents in the office which enabled him to return any such account. We did not apply to the Navy Board for information respecting the sums which had been so appropriated, as
<image src="S1V0003P0I0594"/>
<col>1159</col>
those transactions are stated to have taken place without the knowledge of that Board.&#x2014;Lord M. in his examination, objected to answering any question on this subject, relying on the 5th clause of the act by which we are constituted, and also upon the circumstances alluded to in his letter before recited. He also declined, and upon the same grounds, to inform his whether he had derived any profit or advantage from the use or employment of money issued for carrying on the current service of the Navy, between 1st Jan. 1786 and 31st May 1800; that is, from the time of the operation of the act for lodging the money in the Bank, to the time of his quitting office.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01868">However the apprehension of disclosing delicate and confidential transactions of gov. might operate with Lord M. in withholding information respecting advances to other departments, we do not perceive how that apprehension can at all account for his refusing to state, whether he derived any profit or advantage from the use or employment of money issued for the services of the Navy. If his lordship had received into his hands such monies only as were advanced by him to other departments, and had replaced them as soon as they were repaid, he could not have derived any profit or advantage from such transactions, however repugnant they Blight be to the provisions of the legislature for the safe custody of the public money. Although we were not able to ascertain what monies were paid over or advanced to Lord M. yet, independent of such advances, Mr. Trotter admits in the latter part of his examination, that, in following his lordship's instructions, or in acting in his affairs as his private agent, he had occasionally laid out for his use or benefit from 10 to 20,000l. without considering whether he was previously in advance to his lordship, or whether such advances were made from his public or private balances.&#x2014;Mr. T. not only drew money from the Bank in large sums, which he deposited with his private bankers, Messrs. T. Coutts and Co. but he also prevailed with the sub-accountants to deposit the greater part of their balances with that house. One of them, indeed, the cashier of the Victualling, acquiesced with reluctance, having always before that time kept his balance at the Bank, and wishing still to keep it there; he stated to us, that it was by direction of Mr. T. he opened an account with Messrs. T. Coutts where he took
<col>1160</col>
credit for the sums advanced to. him by Mr. T.'s drafts on that house; but that be drew out those sums as the public service required, and kept the greater part of his balance at the Bank, where he deposited such sums as were advanced to him by drafts on the Bank.&#x2014;Mr. T. states, that between the years 1791 and 1799, the greater part of the monies drawn by him from the Bank, passed through the hands of Messrs. Coutts; that the monies so drawn were sometimes placed to his credit in his accounts with them, and at others were carried immediately to the credit of the respective sub-accountants; and that the consent of the Treasurer to this measure was signified to him in a conversation, in which he represented the facility that would be afforded to the public business, and the additional security to the Treasurer, by the drafts being left with the bankers, instead of their being sent to the Bank, and the money brought from thence, at his risk, by the messengers of the office.&#x2014;Lord M. states, that he certainly did permit Mr. T. to lodge any money drawn from the Bank for public purposes in his private banker's hands, during the period that it was not demanded for the purposes for which it was drawn; but it is to be inferred from his evidence, that he intended Mr. T. to draw upon the Bank for the amount only of the assignments made on him by the different Boards (an account of which is furnished to him daily) and that the balance of such sum, till demanded, should alone be lodged by Mr. T. in the hands of his private bankers. The reason given by his lordship for this permission is, the opinion, that it would add more facility to the conduct of the business of the office in the multitude of small payments to be made, than if the money were to be deposited, according to the constitution of the office, in an iron chest; and that the various parties receiving small payments would be less liable to be imposed upon than if they were each to receive drafts for such small sums upon the bank, at such a distance from the office after its removal to Somerset-place.&#x2014; Although the larger demands upon the Treasurer are paid by draft, a necessity for making the small-payments in money has always existed, and the money necessary for this purpose is of course drawn from the Bank. The sums so drawn, if conveniency only had been studied, should have been placed in the charge of the different sub-accountants, by whom such
<image src="S1V0003P0I0595"/>
<col>1161</col>
demands are paid, and not kept in the hands of the paymaster, who is not a disburser of public money, except that issued for the payment of exchequer fees.&#x2014;With respect to the risk of bringing the money from the bank, and of the loss or embezzlement of the drafts by the messengers of the pay office, we do not find that the apprehensions entertained on this subject arose from the experience of former losses; for none are known to have happened.&#x2014; The opinion which we had formed of the insufficiency of the motives assigned for the departure from the act of parliament, is confirmed by the enquiries instituted, and the measures taken in consequence thereof by the succeeding treasurers. Lord Harrowby, the immediate successor of lord M. disapproved of the practice, as being inconsistent with the spirit of the act; and as he had just quitted the office of Paymaster of the army, where similar regulations had been established and carried into effect without any complaint of inconvenience, he was desirous of putting the office of Treasurer of the Navy upon the same footing; but previously to his directing an alteration, he deemed it necessary to enquire minutely into the validity of the reasons urged against the change. His lordship had nearly completed the necessary enquiries, to satisfy his mind that the difficulties and inconveniences which might arise in the detail of the business from this change, were not sufficient to alter the opinion he had formed, when he was prevented by a severe illness from attending further to the business of the office. The right hon Ch. Bathurst who succeeded lord Harrowby, put a final stop to the practice of drawing the money out of the Bank, and lodging it in the hands of a private banker, in the summer of 1802, from a conviction that such practice was inconsistent with the spirit of the act for the regulation of the office of the Treasure? of the Navy, and that the conveniences which were suggested to result from it in facilitating the transaction of business, were not of weight sufficient to justify the continuance of such an irregularity. The sub-accountants were likewise directed to lodge their balances in the bank. Mr. Bathurst states, that no representations were made to him of inconveniences resulting from this change of system; and Mr. Trotter himself allows, that no material inconveniences did arise. Mr. T. a few days before he quitted office, proposed to the right hon. G. Tierney, the

then treasurer, that instead of drafts being given to the sub-accountants on the Bank payable to them or bearer, the Paymaster should, from time to time, direct such sums as might be necessary to be transferred from the Treasurer's account at the Bank to the accounts of the sub-accountants. This proposal, which, if adhered to, would be an effectual bar to his successors receiving money into their own hands by their drafts on the bank, was adopted by Mr. Tierney; and we learn from Mr. Latham, who acted as his Paymaster, that no inconvenience was experienced from this mode of transfer, nor was he aware of any facility or advantage from the intervention of a private banker. As it is the strongest refutation of the reasoning urged for a departure from the regulations established by the act of parliament, that these regulations have been since carried into execution without inconvenience, we shall not dwell longer on this subject; but we feel it incumbent on us to declare our opinion, that the circumstance which actually led to the withdrawing of the money in large sums from the Bank previously to its being issued to the sub-accountants for the public service, was the opportunity thereby afforded to the application of it to purposes of private use and advantage. As au additional security against the public money being drawn from the Bank for any but public purposes, it is directed by the act of parliament, that in each draft shall be specified the head of service for which it is drawn, and that without this specification the draft shall not be deemed a voucher to the bank for the payment; and it has been stated to us, that this form has been strictly adhered to, and that no money has been drawn from the Bank without specifying a particlar, head of service. Such drafts might be in all cases sufficient authority to the Bank; but, when used by the paymaster to draw money into his own possession, and for other purposes than the services specified, it has been a palpable evasion, of the act. As we could not obtain information from Mr. Trotter as to the manner in which the public money had been disposed of, between the time of its being drawn from the Bank and the time of its being applied to the public service, we called upon Mr. T. Wilson, the chief clerk in the bill and remittance department of the Navy Pay Office, a branch lately established* but who has been generally employed as an assistant to the paymaster, and by whom one of the accounts
<image src="S1V0003P0I0596"/>
<col>1163</col>
rendered to us of the disposition of the treasurer's balances was signed. The evidence given by Mr. Wilson is of an extraordinary nature; he avowed having derived an advantage from the use or employment of money issued for the payment of exchequer fees, the charge of which was transferred to him by Mr. Trotter in 1800; but he objected to answering every question put to him as to the disposition of the public balances, or the advantage derived by the paymaster therefrom, or even to giving any explanation of the official account of the treasurer's balances, although signed by himself; and pleaded his being protected by the 5th clause of the act by which this commission is constituted, although he declared that he had not derived any profit, advantage, or benefit whatever, from or in consequence of the public money having been applied to private use by any person or persons. Such conduct in a person in office appeared to us by no means creditable; and, if it were generally adopted, it might be the means of rendering ineffectual all such commissions of enquiry as that under which we act. Having no other means of obtaining information as to the manner in which the public money had been applied to private use, and the extent to which it had been carried, but by resorting to Messrs. Coutts, we examined E. Antrobus, esq. the principal acting partner in that house. From him we learned that Mr. Trotter, during the time he was paymaster, had 5 accounts with this house, of the following descriptions; viz. 1. An Account in his Name, as Paymaster, which commenced the 10th of Jan. 1786, and was closed on the 4th of March 1801. This Account was principally confined to the money received from the exchequer for the payment of exchequer fees, and some other contingencies. 2. An Account in his own Name, which commenced the 1st of April 1786, and is now open. To this Account the greater part of the monies drawn from the Bank was carried, and blended with his private monies. 3. A separate Account, which commenced the 5th of April 1788, and was closed the 23d of Sept. 1791. In this account the money drawn from the Bank has also been blended with his private money. 4. A private Account, which commenced the 9th Oct. 1789, and was closed the 8th of Feb. 1703. Tins Account was first described by Mr. A. as containing public money; but, upon a further investigation, he desired to alter that
<col>1164</col>
statement. 5. An Account in trust for the estate of Adam Jellicoe, esq. deceased, which commenced the 19th Sept. 1789, and was closed 17th May 1800. To this Account was carried the money recovered from the estate of Mr. A. Jellicoe, late deputy paymaster of the Navy, which will be hereafter explained.&#x2014; Mr. Antrobus shewed great disinclination to giving us any information with respect to Mr. Trotter's accounts without his consent; alleging, that the money received by Messrs. T. Coutts at the Bank, on Mr. T.'s drafts, had been carried to accounts in his name as an individual, and not in his public capacity of Paymaster of the Navy; but after Mr. A. had taken the opinion of counsel as to the authority vested in this Board, to require him to disclose the transactions of Mr. T. with his house, as far as the public money was concerned, he submitted to answer the questions that were put to him on those points.&#x2014;By the evidence of Mr. A. it appears, that public money received by Messrs. Coutts from the Bank, on Mr. T.'s drafts, had been invested in exchequer and navy bills, lent upon the security of stock, and employed by Mr. T. in discounting private bills; and that considerable purchases of Bank and Fast India Stock were made by Messrs. Coutts on account of Mr. T. We thereupon issued our precept to Messrs. Coutts for the Accounts of Mr. A. Trotter, containing any entries of sums received by his drafts on the Bank, giving them an option either to produce their books, or to furnish us with copies of the accounts. They preferred the former mode, and accordingly laid before us the books containing, 1. Mr. T.'s Account, as Paymaster of the Navy, from its commencement to the time of its being closed; 2. The Account, in his own name, from the 24th June 1791 to the 17th July 1802; and, 3. His separate Account, from the 27th Feb. 1789 to the 27th May 1790; of which accounts we caused copies to be taken. They withheld the parts of the two last accounts prior and subsequent to the periods mentioned, and his private account as not containing any entries of sums received by Mr. T.'s drafts on the bank. This reason for keeping back thus much of the accounts was verified by Mr. Chapman, their clerk, who examined the accounts for that purpose, and produced to us a list of the drafts given by Mr. T. on tin.; Bunk, which had been carried to his credit in the accounts, distinguished as his own account, and his separate account.&#x2014;
<image src="S1V0003P0I0597"/>
<col>1165</col>
The money received by Messrs. Coutts by the drafts of Mr. T. on the Bank, appears to have been money issued for Navy services, because Mr. T. had no private account there, and drew upon the Bank solely as the agent or attorney of the Treasurer of the Navy.&#x2014;If official convenience only had been the object in opening accounts with Messrs. Coutts, it might have been expected that the public; money placed there would have been separated from all private concerns, and kept under clear and distinct heads. Instead of this obvious caution, we do not find that even any open declaration was made to the house of the nature of the property entrusted to them; and the whole of the public money received on account of Mr. T. by his drafts on the Bank, was placed to his private accounts, and so mixed with other monies, that the one could not be distinguished from the other; nor could it be discovered, upon the face of the accounts, from whom several of the sums were received, or to whom paid; and Mr. T. himself could not ascertain whether certain advances of money made by him to lord Melville, were from his public or private balances. The manner of keeping Mr. T.'s accounts is also assigned by lord M. as a reason for his not being able to answer some questions which were put to him, relative to the employment of the public money.&#x2014;It was not in our power, without the assistance of Mr. Trotter, to distinguish whether many of the items in the accounts related to public or private money; and Mr. T. when called upon, refused to give us that assistance. We have therefore entered in the Appendix copies of the accounts, entitled, his own account, and his separate account; and an abstract of his account, entitled, his paymaster's account. We have obliterated the names to all entries in the two former accounts under 100l. to prevent the unnecessary exposure of private concerns. If this has not been done to the full extent we could have wished, it must</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01870">be considered, that blending in one account official and private money transactions in the manner before described, has rendered the bringing of them together into public view unavoidable. The inspection of these accounts will afford much fuller information of the manner in which the public money has been applied than any description which it is in our power to give. We have distinguished in the accounts the sums that were received by Messrs. Coutts by Mr. T.'s drafts on the Bank. The part of the account rendered to us, entitled Mr. T.'s separate account, contains only, a few entries of money received by his drafts on the Bank; but the money so received appears distinctly on the face of the account to have, been applied to private purposes. Although the only direct proof which we have been able to obtain of public money having been carried to the credit of Mr. T.'s accounts with Messrs, Coutts is, by their having received money upon his drafts on the Bank; yet on an inspection of the accounts it will be seen, that sums of such magnitude, not received by Mr. T.'s drafts on the Bank, have been brought to his credit, as to afford strong presumption that they were part of the public money. Deposits of money, not received by drafts on the Bank, to the amount of 100,000l. and upwards on the same day, and in the course of a few days, will be met with frequently. In one instance, the 11th April 1795, the sum of one million, not received by draft on the Bank, is placed to his credit.&#x2014;As a further proof of other public money, besides that received directly from the Bank, being included in the account called his own account, we subjoin a comparative statement of the sums received directly from the Bank, and the sums paid from that account to the different sub-accountants of the Navy Pay Office, and for services which we conclude to be of a public nature:</p>

We conclude that the difference, 6,783,317l. 2s. 11d. was money issued for Navy Services, drawn from the Bank by Mr. T. and deposited with Messrs. Coutts, after having passed through his own hands, or the hands of some agent employed by him to receive it by his drafts on the Bank.&#x2014; As the name of Mr. Mark Sprot appeared frequently in the accounts, as paying into the house of Messrs. Coutts on account of Mr. T. and receiving from thence very large sums, we deemed it necessary to examine him as to the nature of his transactions with the paymaster of the Navy; but after deposing, that, to the best of his recollection, he had not received any money from the Bank by Mr. T.'s drafts, he refused to answer every other question put to him; alleging that he had taken the advice of counsel, who were of opinion that he was not bound to answer such questions. Upon the whole, it appears to us to be a clearly established fact, that, during this treasurership, the money issued for navy services was used to a great amount for the purposes of private emolument: and this circumtsance leads us to observe, that if a Treasurer of the Navy, after an increase of his salary upon the terms contained in the warrant under his majesty's sign manual, derive profit from the use of money issued for Navy Services, he becomes upon principles of equity a debtor to the public, and is accountable for all such profit. Our duty requires us to add, that the withdrawing of the public money from the Bank of England in the manner and for the purposes before related, was, in our judgment, a disobedience to the law as established by the 25th of the present reign, c. 31. We cannot dismiss the consideration of this treasurership without adverting to a paper delivered to us by Mr. Trotter, drawn up in justification of his conduct, and purporting to be a statement of the transactions of his paymastership. Actuated by a desire that all persons who might conceive their character called in question by our proceedings, might have an opportunity of justifying themselves, and explaining their conduct, we have never refused to admit any details given with that view by the persons whom we have examined, notwithstanding such details may have been irrelevant to the questions proposed by us. Upon this principle we received from Mr. T. the paper in question, which is attached to his evidence of the 25th of July 1804. but it is fit that we
<col>1168</col>
should offer some comments upon it, as well as upon the evidence contained in the Appendix. And this is more especially called for in the case of an examinant, who, to avoid the danger of criminating himself, refuses explanations required of him, and afterwards offers a justification on his own terms. In this paper Mr. T. does not deny his having made use of the public money withdrawn by him from the Bank; and in his subsequent examination, he intimates, that in so doing he had acted under permission, although he says he is not at liberty to slate that he has ever been explicitly authorised to do so. Lord Melville, upon being asked whether he gave permission to the paymaster to withdraw the money from the Bank and lodge it in the hands of a private Banker, with a view to his deriving any advantage or emolument therefrom, answers, "If it is meant to ask me whether I ever gave any direct authority to the paymaster to use the money in the manner above mentioned, I should certainly answer no; but I have no hesitation in saying that I believed and understood he did, and never prohibited him from doing so; and I believe it was so understood by others at different times, when the establishment of the Navy Pay Office was under consideration, when certainly no competent provision was made for the person exercising that trust of great extent and responsibility." Whether the salary of the paymaster was not increased when the general augmentation of the salaries of the cashiers took place in 1786, because he was not in the direct charge or use of the public money other than the money for exchequer fees, or because he was not, like the cashiers, in the receipt of fees or gratuities of which they were then deprived, is what we cannot pretend to affirm; but we cannot suppose that the use of the public money was then considered as a perquisite of the pay master; which would imply, that the recommendations of the commissioners of accounts, the resolution of the house of commons, and finally, the act of parliament, were totally disregarded, and that an emolument so fraught with evil to the public, which had been lately commuted with the treasurer for an additional salary of more than 2,000l. a year, was, by those entitled to consider of the establishment of the Navy Pay Office, thought proper to devolve on his deputy, the paymaster. Mr. T. in his paper also states, that he has no
<image src="S1V0003P0I0599"/>
<col>1169</col>
doubt, though he cannot prove it, that advantages were enjoyed by his predecessors from the use of the public money; and that, "the exceeding smallness of the salary of paymaster affords a presumption, that such advantages have been considered as forming a part of the remuneration of so anxious and confidential a charge." From all the information we have been able to obtain, it does not appear that Mr. T.'s predecessors did enjoy any such advantage. It is positively stated by Mr. Harmood, paymaster to Mr. Barr&#x00E9;, that he did not; nor did he conceive the use of the public money to form any part of the emolument of his office. And it is stated by lord Bayning, that he did not know, nor did he believe, that Mr. Douglas, while he acted as his paymaster, derived any profit or advantage from the use or employment of the public money, except the money issued for the payment of exchequer fees. As a further answer to the observation, that the use of the public money was considered as a perquisite of the paymaster, when the augmentation of salaries in the Navy Pay Office took place in Aug. 1786, we find that Mr. T. in his examination on the 2d, 9th, and 12th of Oct. in that year, before the commissioners appointed to enquire into the fees, gratuities, perquisites, and emoluments received in the several public offices, deposes, "That he has at present some advantage from balances remaining in his hands, which were imprested to the present treasurer for the purpose of paying exchequer fees, and some other contingencies; but the amount of such advantages he cannot possibly ascertain. He is also allowed stationery of all sorts for his own use, but does not recollect any fee, gratuity, or other allowance or perquisite whatever, which he enjoys as Paymaster of the Navy." If Mr. T. was in the practice of deriving advantage from the use of money applicable to navy services at the time of making this deposition, which was only 2 months after the increase 6f the salaries in the navy pay office, the mention of so considerable a source of emolument could not have been omitted. The commissioners before whom this deposition was made, certainly did not collect from it, that the use of money applicable to navy services was a perquisite of the paymaster; for in detailing his income, after mentioning his salary, and his allowances of coach-hire, coals, candles, and
<col>1170</col>
stationery, they state, "he at present derives some advantage from the balance of money remaining in his hands for the purpose of paying exchequer fees, and some other contingencies, but has no fee, gratuity, or other emolument whatever." And they recommend that his salary should be increased from 500l. to 800l. per ann. to be in lieu of all contingencies or allowances whatsoever; and that he should "not be permitted to derive any advantage whatever from public money remaining in his hands; but that the money issued to pay exchequer fees, amp;c. should be paid into the Bank, and drawn from thence for the public service in like manner as all other money for naval services now is."&#x2014;The salary, proposed by those commissioners, was of course deemed by them a full equivalent for the labour and responsibility of the situation.&#x2014; When the business of the navy pay office was under the consideration of the select committee of the House of Commons on Finance, in 1797, they required an account of the increase or diminution which had taken place since 1782, in the amount of salaries and emoluments in the navy pay office. The account furnished is contained in the 17th report. The increase of the emolument of odd pence received by the clerks is mentioned; but no notice is taken of the advantage derived by the paymaster from the use of the money issued for the service of the navy; although it must have arisen since 1782, as the paymaster at that time did not derive any emolument therefrom. Hence it must appear, that the use of the public money was not considered, even in 1797, as an avowed emolument of the paymaster.&#x2014;Mr. T. states in his paper, that in drawing money from the Bank in gross, and retaining it in his own hands, or lodging it with his private banker, he does not consider that he has departed from the letter or spirit of the act for the better regulation of the office of treasurer of the navy: he says, it was directed by that act, that all issues to the treasurer of the navy from the exchequer should be placed to his credit at the Bank of England, and be drawn from thence by drafts, specifying the heads of service for which it is wanted; and he further states, that these directions have accordingly been invariably followed. We have already shewn in what manner the directions for the heads of service being mentioned in the drafts have been evaded;
<image src="S1V0003P0I0600"/>
<col>1171</col>
and in reciting the act, he has not noticed the clause which directs that the monies issued to the Bank on account of the treasurer, shall not be paid but of the Bank unless for navy services. It surely cannot be advanced, that the money drawn by the paymaster for private use was paid out of the Bank for navy services.&#x2014;One of the reasons given by the paymaster for keeping balances in his own hands is, the having of money in readiness to advance to the sub-accountants when the demands upon them were greater than were foreseen; and in his evidence of the 19th Oct. he states, that he has made advances to them in cash and bank notes; but this circumstance is contradicted by the sub-accountants; and it will hardly be contended, that money standing in the name of the treasurer at the Bank is not as much within his power as in the house of a private banker. In order however to judge of the necessity of the case, we thought proper to enquire, whether, as it was stated to us by the paymaster, the cashiers received daily advances of money equal to one or two days expenditure. We therefore required an account of their balances on the 31st of Dec. in each year, and of the days in each succeeding year when those balances were exhausted. By the following statement, drawn out from those accounts, it will appear, that, previously to 1801, their balances were generally equal to between a week's and a fortnight's expenditure. (Here follows the table.) As we see no reason why the advances should not be made to the sub-accountants from day to day, the balances left in their hands prior to 1803 appear to us to have been considerably more than the public service required,&#x2014;We think it proper however to observe, that the cashier of the victualling, since his salary was raised in 1786 from 150l. to 400l. per aim. does not appear to have derived any advantage from the use of the public money; nor the present deputy paymaster, nor the cashier of allotments, since their appointment in 1795.&#x2014; The cashier of the navy, who was appointed in 1792, appears to have been in the practice of vesting certain sums, which he says were small, in navy bills; but he has not done so latterly.&#x2014;The money wanted for the department of the cashier of the navy is at present drawn from the Bank by one of his clerks. We think the several duties of the sub-accountants should be performed by them in person, and this
<col>1172</col>
part of the duty in particular.&#x2014;Mr. Trotter, in his paper, lays much stress upon the smallness of his salary, in comparison to the responsibility of his situation. The office of paymaster is certainly an important one, and considerable confidence must be reposed in him; but if he regulates his conduct strictly by the provisions of the act of parliament, his actual responsibility is much less than that of the sub-accountants. Since the time that the paymaster transferred the charge of the Exchequer fee money to the clerk employed in soliciting the money at the exchequer, there has not been any necessity for the paymaster's having in his hands any part of the public money; whereas, large sums must necessarily be trusted to the custody of the sub-accountants.&#x2014;The salary of the paymaster has always been superior to that of the sub-accountants. When the salaries of the latter were augmented on the 21st of May 1800, from 400l. to 660l. per ann. that of the paymaster was increased from 500l. to 800l.&#x2014;With respect to the observation contained in Mr. T.'s paper, namely, that the amount of money issued from the exchequer did not depend upon him nor upon the treasurer, it is true that in his applications to the lords of the treasury for money, he was under the directions of the public boards; but it is certainly in the power of a paymaster, by delaying his applications, or not using due diligence in soliciting the money from the exchequer, to create a necessity for the different boards to make earlier applications, and consequently to keep greater balances with the treasurer. However this may have been, we know that the disbursements in the navy pay office might have been carried on with smaller balances; in proof of which, we need only notice the sums received from Mr. T. and applied by Lord Melville, those in the hands of Mr. T. and those for many years converted by Mr. Jellicoe to his private concerns, of which we shall speak hereafter. The amount of these sums (and at times they must have been very large) need not have been taken from the exchequer, for it is evident the payments for the navy services were carried on without them&#x2014;We have entered in the appendix a general statement of the annual receipts, payments, and balances of the treasurer of the navy, from 1786 to 1803; and a general statement of the monthly receipts, payments, and balances, for 1796 and 1800.&#x2014;We have likewise in-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0601"/>
<col>1173</col>
serted an account, furnished by the navy board, of the amount of the Treasurer's receipts, the assignments made on him by the different boards, and the amount of the unassigned balance in each year from 1786 to 1800.&#x2014;Upon comparing the above accounts, we observe that the amount of the assignments or orders upon the treasurer, as might be expected, does not accord with the amount of the sums paid by him within the year; and consequently, that the balances at the end of the year by the two accounts do not agree.&#x2014;There is also a difference in the amount of the sums stated to be received by the treasurer within the year; but this, we are told, has arisen from the manner in which the treasurer has brought to account sums paid to him by individuals (who have had money imprested to them by the different boards) in order to clear their imprests.&#x2014; Instead of charging himself with the sums so paid to him, he has recharged himself with the whole sum advanced upon imprest, of which he had previously acquitted himself, and has discharged himself of the sum actually disbursed by the party, by which he in fact charges himself with the balance, but it materially augments in his accounts the total of his receipts within the year. We are of opinion, that all monies should be carried to account in the same manner by the treasurer, and by the persons employed in the public offices to check his accounts, in order that the two accounts may correspond.&#x2014;(Here follows a statement drawn up from the above accounts, shewing the amount of the treasurer's unassigned and actual balances on the 31st Dec. in each year, from 1786 to 1803, and the number of days such balances would have lasted, at the average rate of expenditure of the succeeding years.) On considering the above statement, it will appear, particularly before 1796, that much larger sums were left in the hands of the treasurer than the public service required: on an average, the unassigned balance left in his hands prior to the above period, was equal to 33 days expenditure of each succeeding year, and his actual balance, during the same period, would have been equal to 45 days expenditure. We see no reason why the money in the treasurer's charge should, at any time, be more than equal to 10 days probable expenditure, exclusive of the money lodged at the outports to pay the wages of such ships, as may
<col>1174</col>
unexpectedly arrive in time of war. The practice of the public boards, and particularly of the Navy Board, in applying for sums under minute heads of service, and of considering such sums as appropriated to those services, instead of being applicable to the general service of each department, tends very much to increase the treasurer's balance unnecessarily. The impolicy and disadvantage of this practice were seen by the commissioners for taking and stating the public accounts of the kingdom, and it was recommended by them that the practice should be abolished. No measures have, however, been adopted in consequence of that recommendation; and the comptroller of the Navy states, he does not conceive that much benefit would be derived from carrying it into execution, as the navy board have transferred sums from one head of service to another, whenever it has appeared to them necessary, which have been replaced when money has been received on the head of service to which the advance was made. The applying of the money issued from the exchequer to the general purposes of each department, would not only prevent the irregularity in the accounts, and the unnecessary trouble occasioned by the mode of transfer above-mentioned; but the advantage to be derived therefrom in lessening the balance which it may be necessary to keep in the hands of the treasurer is so obvious, that we think it expedient that the recommendations of the commissioners of accounts should be carried into execution.&#x2014;Mr. Trotter, in his justification, asserts, that the public has not sustained any loss from his use of the money issued for the service of the navy. To this observation we cannot allow any weight; he might have been unsuccessful in his speculations, or the persons with whom the public money was lodged might have failed; and in either of these cases, the loss would probably have fallen on the public; or in case of Mr. T.'s death, it might have become necessary to unravel his very intricate Recounts in a court of law, before the balance in his hands could have been recovered. At any rate, the public money has been unnecessarily put to hazard; and that in defiance of the precautions taken, against it by the legislature.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01872">The evil arising from the application of public money by individuals to private use, is strongly exemplified in the case of Mr.

Adam Jellicoe, formerly deputy paymaster of the navy, which was brought to our notice from the circumstance of lord Melville's having been acquitted in his accounts of the sum of 24,846l. 6s. 6&#x00BC;d. as the amount of Mr. Jellicoe's deficiency. Having found that the public money had been very generally applied to private use by Mr. Trotter the paymaster, we were induced to call upon Mr. S. Jellicoe, to endeavour to ascertain whether Mr. T. derived any advantage from suffering so large a balance to remain in the hands of Mr. A. Jellicoe, his father. Mr. S. Jellicoe stated, he had no conception that his father paid any consideration to Mr. T. or to any other person, on that account; but we learned from him, that his father died possessed of certain freehold property, which had not been sold and applied in liquidation of his debt to the treasurer of the navy; and that he, Mr. S. Jellicoe, was still indebted to his father's estate in the sum of 1,950l. part of a debt of 4,000l. which it had been agreed he should pay by instalments of 200l. a year. We therefore felt it incumbent on us to enquire into all the circumstances respecting Mr. A. Jellicoe's debt, and the ground upon which the treasurer had been acquitted of this deficiency. Mr. A. Jellicoe was appointed chief clerk in the office for the payment of seamen's wages, afterwards styled deputy paymaster, on the 30th Nov. 1776, and continued to hold that office until the 30th of Aug. 1780. We have not been able to learn when it was first discovered that Mr. Jellicoe was deficient in his balance; but it appears that on the 10th July 1788, lord Melville informed him by letter, that he observed the balance in his hands remained constantly greater than it used to be formerly; that no circumstance appeared to render it necessary; and if it was not so, his lordship suggested the necessity of reducing it, and expressed a wish for explanation. Mr. J. in reply, observed, that he should take the earliest opportunity of paying in all his balance, for which there was no immediate demand } but in case his lordship thought security necessary, he begged to offer sundry bonds and assignments of Mr. Cort's patent, amounting to a larger sum than he could at any lime hope to have in his hands unemployed. Lord M. in his evidence states, that the first thing which awakened his suspicion, was, that Mr. J.'s balance fluctuated between 20 and 30,000l. and was never re-
<col>1176</col>
duced below the former sum, which induced his lordship to have a particular conversation with Mr. J. in which he confessed, that for a considerable number of years he had been embarrassed by engagements he had entered into with Mr. Cort in an undertaking for rendering Cast iron malleable. Upon this discovery, it is stated by his lordship, that Mr. J.'s balance was minutely enquired into, and the amount of his deficiency ascertained; but no record of this enquiry is to be found in the treasurer's office, nor have we been able to trace it. We cannot but remark the great remissness shewn on this occasion. A discovery is made by the treasurer of a large sum of money having been applied to private use by one of his cashiers, confessedly in embarrassed circumstances; and yet neither is that person suspended from his office, nor the security tendered accepted. A notation is made on Mr. J.'s letter, that these securities were found at his death; it might have been otherwise; they might have been made over to other persons. If these were the same securities, an examination of them at the time might have shewn that they were inadequate to make good the deficiency. Whatever opinion had formerly been entertained of Mr. J.'s fortune or reputation, it ought no longer to have had any weight against the precautions necessary to secure the property of the public. Mr. J. continued to perform the duties of his office till the 15th Aug. 1789; but on the 28th it was thought right to issue extents of the crown into the counties of Middlesex and Hampshire, against his person and property. The solicitor of the admiralty being out of town, Messrs. Chamberlayne and White, on the application of Mr. Trotter., undertook to conduct the process on behalf of the treasurer against Mr. J. The extents were issued on the 29th, and Mr. J. appears to have died on the following day. Upon the return of the extent, and the inquisition taken by the sheriff of Middlesex, all the property named therein appears to have been sold, except Mr. Cort's patent, valued at 100l. and the proceeds carried to an account opened on the 19th Sept. 1789, by Mr. Trotter, with Messrs. T. Coutts. By the inquisition returned by the sheriff of Hampshire, it appears Mr. J. was seised of a freehold warehouse and wharf at Gosport, let at the yearly rent of 100l. and valued at 1,000l.; a freehold messuage at Ports-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0603"/>
<col>1177</col>
mouth Common, let at the yearly rent of 12l. and valued at 150l.; and also a messuage and farm at Shidfield, let at the yearly rent of 65l. and valued at 1,500l. No writ of Venditioni exponas was issued upon this return; the freehold property is still undisposed of; but the farm being copyhold, and mortgaged, has been taken possession of by the mortgagee. We have entered in the Appendix an account of Mr. J.'s debts to the treasurer and extreasurers of the Navy, at the lime of his decease, so far as the same can be ascertained. We could not learn whether he owed any thing to the right hon. Welbore Ellis, the certificate books of that treasurership having been surreptitiously taken out of the Navy Fay Office. These debts of Mr. J. amounted, in the whole, to 39,070l. 10s. 3&#x00BC;d. viz.

Upon the death of Mr. J. his public papers were taken possession of by Mr. Trotter, together with such of his private papers as were judged necessary to secure the debt due to the public. From these papers, together with Mr. J.'s private ledger, Mr. G. Black, an accountant, was employed at the Navy Pay Office to draw out a schedule of Mr. J.'s effects, and the debts due to him, which together, on the 29th Aug. 1789, the day preceding his death, amounted to 89,657l. 9s. 6&#x00BC;d. Many of the debts are marked by the accountant as bad; and we apprehend the debt from Mr. Cort, not so marked, of 54,853l. 9s. 2&#x00BC;d. is of that description. We have entered this schedule in the Appendix, with the initials of the names of the parties only, as preventing another View of the employment of the public money. Among Mr. J.'s papers at the time of his decease was found one directed to be opened in case of his sudden death, dated the 11th Nov. 1782; in which he states, that it had been his practice to keep in his iron chest, navy bills, &amp;c. equal to the amount of his balance, until his engagements with Mr. Cort about two years preceding; which had employed so much more of his money than he expected, that lie was at the date of the paper,
<col>1178</col>
to his great concern, very deficient in his balance. The sum of 13,896l. 8s. 10&#x00BD;d. was received from Mr. J.'s estate, and applied in liquidation of his debt to lord Melville, as appears by an account rendered by Mr. Trotter, by which that debt was reduced to 24,846l. 6s. 6&#x00BC;d. Lord M. in May 1800, previously to his quitting the office of treasurer, presented to the lords commissioners of the treasury a detailed statement of the circumstances respecting Mr. J.'s debt. There being no record of this statement in the navy pay office, and lord M. and Mr. T. not being able to furnish us with a copy of it, we obtained from the treasury the original, together with a minute of their lordships, made on the 29th of May 1800, by which it appears, that their lordships were of opinion, it was expedient the treasurer of the navy should be exonerated from accounting for the said 24,846l. 6s. 6&#x00BC;d.; and they directed a warrant to be prepared to be submitted to his majesty for that purpose: lord M. was accordingly acquitted of the same by writ of privy seal. The statement to the lords of the treasury, upon which the writ of privy seal was grounded, appears to be incorrect in some material points. His lordship observes, "being left in this situation (that is on the death of Mr. J.) he had no alternative, but to save for the public the wreck of the property Mr. J. died possessed of; and an extent having been issued immediately on his death, all his effects that were available were turned into money, and paid in diminution of the debt."&#x2014;The freehold warehouse and wharf at Gosport, together with the freehold messuage at Portsmouth Common, returned to the extent issued into Hampshire, were not then, nor, as we have before observed, are they yet sold; and we conceive they could hardly have been forgotten, as Mr. Trotter, on behalf of lord Melville, received from Mr. S. Jellicoe, on the 21st of May, a few days prior to the date of the writ of privy seal, the sum of 846l. 8s. 8d. eight years and three quarters rent for the warehouse and wharf due Lady-day 1800, besides 1,750l. being the instalments then due on account of Mr. S. J.'s debt to his father, making, together, 2,596l. 8s. 8d. On reference to the schedule of Mr. J.'s effects, we also find debts to a considerable amount stated to be good, which have not been recovered. A sum of 55l. 11s. 6d. appeared to be due to him from
<image src="S1V0003P0I0604"/>
<col>1179</col>
Messrs. Coutts as the balance of an account which he had opened with them, at the desire of Mr. Trotter. This sum has since been received, and 52l. 4s. 6d. part of it were applied in paying the fees on the writ of privy seal. The remainder is still unaccounted for: this circumstance is mentioned merely to shew how negligently every part of this business has been conducted. His lordship further observes "a statement of the sums in the hands of the chief clerk (that is, Mr. Jellicoe) from the time of his (Lord Melville's) coming into office, is subjoined, from which it will appear, that even allowing no weight to Mr. J.'s rank, respectability, and supposed fortune, the confidence placed in him, as to extent, was not beyond what other treasurers had placed in less expensive times; and as from the whole circumstances of the case it must appear, that the most severe measures would not have contributed more to the public good, he trusts that previous to leaving office, he will be enabled finally to close his account, and to pay over his balance in terms of the act of parliament, after deducting therefrom so much of the balance due from Mr. J. at the time of his death as now remains unpaid; and that Mr. Dundas and his successors in the office of treasurer of the navy, may be discharged "from all further account of such balance; the crown still reserving the power to take the most effectual measures for recovering under the extent against Mr. J.'s effects or securities the remainder of the balance." The statement referred to by lord M. is confined to the sums in the hands of Mr. J. during the period of his lordship's treasurership, and therefore can afford no comparison of the extent of the confidence placed in Mr. J. by his lordship, and the extent of the confidence placed in him by former treasurers; therefore we have not entered this statement in the Appendix; but in order to afford such a comparison we have entered in the Appendix an account, shewing the sums with which Mr. J. stood charged at the end of each month, during the several treasurerships of Mr. Barr&#x00E9;, lord Melville, and lord Bayning; an Account, shewing the amount of his charge in each month on account of the treasurer for the time being, from April 1782 to Aug. 1789; and also an account of his aggregate charge on account of the treasurer for the time
<col>1180</col>
being, and the ex-treasurers for the same period, so far as the same can be made up. &#x2014;On reference to the account of the sums with which Mr. J. stood charged on account of the treasurers for the time being, it will be seen that in 1782, a time of war, and 1783, when the fleet was paid off, the average of Mr. J.'s monthly charge was only 6,776l. 13s. 0d.; whereas in 1788 and 89, a period of peace, the average of his monthly charge was 38,999l. 17s. 7d. We therefore cannot agree with his lordship, that the confidence placed in Mr. J. was not beyond what other treasurers had placed in him in less expensive times; nor can we subscribe to the opinion, that measures could not have been adopted which would have contributed more to the public good; as on the 30th of June 1788, when his lordship's attention was directed to the increase of Mr. J.'s balance, his aggregate charge on account of the treasurer and the ex-treasurers, was only 28,752l. 10s. 9d.; whereas at the time of his decease, he stood charged with 37,512l. 18s. 8&#x00BE;d. exclusive of the sum of 2,163l. 11s. 6&#x00BD;d. afterwards paid to persons having demands on lord M.'s act of parliament, new account, for which Mr. J. had taken credit.&#x2014;We have before shewn, that all the sums recoverable from Mr. J.'s estate were not received prior to lord M.'s obtaining the writ of privy seal. Since that time no steps have been taken for recovering the remainder of the debt, if the small balance of Mr. J.'s account at Messrs. Coutts's be excepted.&#x2014;Mr. Trotter observes, "Upon lord M.'s being acquitted of any responsibility attached to "Mr. J.'s deficiency, I no longer considered myself under the necessity of "attending to any part of that unfortunate "business." And Mr. White, the solicitor, states, that he has neither been discharged, or has received orders to proceed; that he continued to act in the business until 1792 or 3, but has taken no steps since that time.&#x2014;However a public accountant may be exonerated from personal responsibility, his duty to the public is not fulfilled whilst any diminution of the loss of which he has been acquitted, can be effected by his exertion. In the present case, for the recovery of part of the debt, namely, the accruing rent and instalments due from Mr. S. Jellicoe on account of his debt to his lather, it appears that an agent of government is only wanting to receive it.&#x2014;That the public interest may be no longer
<image src="S1V0003P0I0605"/>
<col>1181</col>
neglected, we think that the statement of Mr. J.'s affairs, drawn up by Mr. Black the accountant, with the other papers relating to his property, should be put iuto the hands of a solicitor, to recover for the public all that can now be had from Mr. J.'s estate. We apprehend much less will be recovered than might have been, if due diligence had been exerted immediately after Mr. J.'s decease, not only from the death of the parties, but from the circumstance of Mr. J.'s private ledger having been lost, which Mr. Black, states appeared to have been kept with great exactness.&#x2014; In future, we would recommend, that before any treasurer of the navy, or other public accountant, be discharged from accounting for deficiencies in his office, a statement of the loss or deficiency, the circumstances attending it, and means taken to recover the same, be sworn to by such accountant before one of the barons of his maj.'s Exchequer; and that such statement, so verified, do accompany any memorial presented to the lords commissioners of the treasury, praying relief.&#x2014; The impolicy of allowing individuals to make use of the public money cannot be too often adverted to, or too forcibly impressed on the minds of those who have the regulation of public offices. It will necessarily follow, that those who enjoy such emolument will get into their hands, and retain as much as possible of the public money; and if the secure profits do not keep pace with their wishes, they will, at the risk of the public, vest it in speculations which promise to be more productive; this is strongly exemplified by the case we have just stated. The salaries of all persons entrusted with public money should be fair and liberal; but, previously to receiving the same, we think they should make oath that they have not derived any advantage, directly or indirectly, from the use or employment of the public money committed to their charge.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01873">Observing in Mr. Trotter's statement, attached to his evidence of the 25th of July, that the sums of 605l. and 533l. remained in his possession, stated to have arisen from official errors, which had been notified to the navy board, we enquired into the circumstances of this transaction, that we might ascertain the nature and cause of these errors, and consider of measures for preventing them in future. In the course of our enquiry we discovered, that this transaction originated in fraud
<col>1182</col>
and not in error; several remittance bills amounting to 1,138l. having been twice charged as paid in the accounts of th6 clerk entrusted with that duty. (After giving the history of this fraud, the report, as to this head, concludes as follows): As this offence was committed so many years ago, and we understand that the person to whom this part of the report particularly relates, has since conducted himself with propriety and fidelity, we have omitted in the appendix all circumstances that might immediately lead to the discovery of his name.</p>

<p id="S1V0003P0-01874"><member>Lord Harrowby</member><membercontribution> held the Office from the 2d of June 1800, to the 20th of Nov. 1801; Mr. Bathurst, from the 21st of Nov. 1801, to the 2d of June 1803; Mr. Tierney, from the 3d of June 1803, to the 28th of May 1804.&#x2014;We have little further to state respecting these treasurers; as we have already noticed their conduct, so far as relates to preventing the paymaster from drawing the public money from the Bank, and lodging it in the hands of a private banker, for the purpose of elucidating some parts of the detail of lord Melville's second treasurership.&#x2014;It appears, that none of them derived any profit or emolument from the use of money issued for navy services; and that no part of that money was applied by any of them, to the use of any other public department.&#x2014;Mr. Trotter acted as paymaster to lord Harrowby and Mr. Bathurst, and, for a short time, to Mr. Tierney; he was succeeded by Mr. Latham, who continued in office till Mr. Canning became Treasurer, when Miv Trotter was again appointed paymaster.&#x2014;It is stated by Mr. Latham, that he did not withdraw from the Bank any money issued for the service of the navy, bat transferred the same from the account of the treasurer to the accounts of the respective sub-accountants; and that ha did not derive any profit or advantage from the use or employment of the public money.</membercontribution></p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01875">The measures which we have further to propose for the better management of the business of the Navy Pay Office are but

<col>1183</col>
few. The Irregularities detailed in this Report, have proceeded rather from the existing regulations having been disregarded than from their being inadequate.&#x2014; We are of opinion, that no time should be lost in completing the accounts of the ex-treasurers, and that the accountant's branch should be afterwards employed in keeping up the annual account of the treasurer; and we see no reason why that account, may not be made up and transmitted to the auditor's office in the course of the succeeding year.&#x2014;We have before had occasion to observe, that the public can derive very little advantage from the examination of accounts, which have been suffered to run many years in arrear.&#x2014;The practice of making issues to the treasurer in exchequer bills, for carrying on the current service in the navy, has interrupted the regularity of his accounts, and of the check kept upon his receipts by the Navy Board.&#x2014;In order to prevent these irregularities, we think it would be highly desirable, that the issues made from the exchequer for the service of the navy should be in cash, or such exchequer bills as the bank agree to take as cash. (After recommending several minor regulations for preventing abuses in future, the Report concludes with stating the following circumstance.) We think it necessary to observe, that on the 10th and 17th of July last, we issued our precepts to Mr. Canning the treasurer of His Majesty's Navy for certain accounts, which were necessary to our forming a judgment as to the propriety of the extent of the balances of public money left in the hands of the treasurer; and not having, on the 2d of Oct. received any communication from the treasurer on the subject of these precepts, rewrote to him, and requested that he would be pleased to give directions for our being furnished with the accounts as soon as possible, and that he would inform us when they might be expected.&#x2014;In reply, he acquainted us, that the delay in making the returns to our precepts had proceeded from representations made to him of the extreme difficulty and hindrance to the current business of the office, which must attend the making out accounts of so complicated a nature, in forms so wholly unusual and unknown in the practice of the treasurer's department; and that upon these representations, he had thought it his duty to, submit the following question to the attorney and solicitor general and the counsel to the admiralty; Whether,
<col>1184</col>
under the words of the act, he was compellable to furnish the accounts called for in the unusual forms prescribed by the precepts, or whether he should not fully satisfy the act by producing to us any or all the accounts of the office in the shape in which they then existed?&#x2014;He at the same time transmitted to us the opinion of the attorney and solicitor general, and the counsel to the admiralty; which we sub-join: "We are of opinion, that the treasurer of the navy will satisfy the words of the act of the 43d G. III. c. 16. by producing to the commissioners of naval enquiry, the accounts of his office in the shape in which they now exist; and that if the labour and the time it would require to make them out in the manner called for by the commissioners of enquiry, are such as to occasion any material obstruction to the business of his department, we think the production of them in their present shape, is all that can be reasonably expected."&#x2014;The accounts we called for by those precepts were afterwards furnished; and we apprehend the current business of the office was not materially impeded by the clerks being employed in preparing them.&#x2014;We have not met with difficulties of this sort, in any of the other departments to which our enquiries have been directed; but we think it right to notice this instance, that in the appointment of commissioners of enquiry in future, the assistance which they may require from the public offices may be defined by the legislature. It is obvious that the business of such offices would be much impeded, and the labour of such commissioners much increased, if the books and documents were to be sent from the offices (as proposed by Mr. Canning) and kept by the commissioners till they could make the proper searches, and extract such matters. as might be necessary for their purpose. Add to this, that the commissioners would frequently have occasion for the attendance of clerks from the offices to explain the entries, and that, if this mode of proceeding were to be adopted as to books and papers at distant places, such as the outports, the inconvenience would be intolerable, and an enquiry on such terms impracticable.

It is impossible for me to furnish you with the account you ask. It is more than 4 years since I left the office of treasurer of the navy, and at the period of doing so, having accounted for every sum imprested into my hands, I transferred the whole existing balance to the account of my successor. From that time I never considered any one paper or voucher that remained in my hands as of the smallest use to myself or any other person; and consequently, being often in the practice, since I retired to Scotland, of employing occasionally some time in assorting my papers, and destroying those that were useless, I am satisfied there does not exist any one material by which I could make up such an account as you specify. But independently of that circumstance, I think it right to remind you, that during a great part of the time I was treasurer of the navy, I held other very confidential situations in government, and was intimately connected with others; so situated, I did not decline giving occasional accommodation from the funds in the treasurer's hands to other services not connected with my official situation as treasurer of the navy. If I had materials to make up such an account as you require, I could not do it without disclosing
<col>1186</col>
delicate and confidential transactions of government, which my duty'to the public must have restrained me from revealing.</p>

To what cause are such deficiencies to be attributed? A. Although I take it for granted the sums are stated by the question accurately, I could not, on memory, state that they are so. I desired Mr. Trotter, so far as I was concerned, to give you every information he could; and it was only in consequence of a conversation with him, immediately after the receipt of your letter to me of date the 26th of June, that I learnt from the manner he kept his private accounts, it was impossible for him to give me the accurate information I required. The same reasons render it impossible for me to give you an answer to the question you put.- 1 am aware that I am not bound to answer it, under the provision of the act establishing this commission; but I should not have dwelt on that objection if there had been nothing but personal considerations to operate against my doing so, but for the reasons I hinted to you in my letter of the 30th June last. As I am not bound, so I would not feel myself warranted, to give the explanations which your question points at.&#x2014;Q. Upon what ground does your lordship decline answering, that question? A. Upon the ground that I have already stated, under the 5th clause of the act 43d G. III. c. 16.&#x2014;Q. Was any part of such sums in your hands? A. They certainly came into my hands, but did not remain there.&#x2014;Q. Did Mr. Trotter, while paymaster of the navy, lay out or apply, or cause to be laid out, or applied, any of the money issued for

<col>1187</col>
carrying on the current service of the navy since 1st Jan. 1786, for your benefit or advantage? A. From the manner in which Mr. Trotter kept my accounts, it is impossible for me to answer that question; and I object to answer this question upon the ground I have stated in answer to the first question.&#x2014;Q. Did you direct or authorise him to do so? A. To the best of my recollection, I never did.&#x2014;Q. Did you, between 1st Jan. 1786 and 31st May 1800, derive any profit or advantage from the use or employment of money issued for carrying on the current service of the navy, under the act 25th Geo. III. c. 31? A. The same reasons which induce me to make the answer I have done to the first question, must induce me to repeat the same answer to this&#x2014;Q. Does your lordship object to answer this question under the provision of the 5th section of the act 43d G. III. c. 16? A. I do; and upon the grounds stated in the answer to my first question.&#x2014;Q. During the time you acted as treasurer of the navy, between 1st Jan. 1786 and 31st May 1800, was any of the money applicable to naval services advanced by you, or by your direction, for any other public service than that of the navy? A. I decline to answer that question, under the provisions of the 5th section of the act 43d G. III. c. l6&#x2014;Q. Was any money, issued for carrying on the current service of the navy, applied by your lordship, or by your direction, for any other public, service than that of the navy, with the knowledge or consent of the navy board? A. No; certainly not.&#x2014;Q. Was there any official note or record made of the money issued for carrying on the current service of the navy, having been advanced by your direction for any other public purposes than that of the navy, or of the re-payment of such money? A. No, there was certainly no official note.&#x2014;Q. Did you authorise the paymaster, in or about 1786, to draw the money applicable to naval services from the Hank, and lodge it in the hands of a private bauker? A. I cannot precisely fix the time; but I am certain that I did permit Mr. Trotter to lodge any money drawn from the Bank for public purposes in his private banker's hands, during the period it was not demanded to the purposes for which it was drawn.&#x2014;Q. What circumstances induced you to give such permission to the paymaster? A. An opinion in which I still adhere;
<col>1188</col>
that if the whole moneys necessarily drawn from the Bank in pursuance of orders from the competent boards, were lodged in the hands of a respectable banker, under the control of the paymaster of the navy, that it would add more facility to the conduct of the business of the office, in the multitude of small payments to be made, than if the money were deposited, according to the constitution of the office, in an iron chest. I likewise had it in contemplation, that in the receipt of these various small payments, made to such a variety of persons, they would be less liable to be imposed upon by that mode of transacting the business than if they were each to receive drafts for such small sums upon the Bank, at such a distance from the office, after its removal to Somerset-place&#x2014;Q. As the paymaster of the navy does not disburse any pan of the public money, except fur the payment of exchequer fees and other contingencies, does your lordship think it necessary that the paymaster should have in the iron chest, or at a private banker's, any of the money issued for carrying on the current service of the navy? A. I do not think it necessary, but, for the reasons I have given, I think it expedient: the whole money drawn from the Hank, and placed in the hands of the sub-accountants, pass through the hands of the paymaster of the navy; but though this is my opinion, I know many very competent persons entertain a different opinion.&#x2014;Q. Did you give permission to the paymaster to withdraw the money from the Bank, and lodge it in the hands of a private bauker, with a view to his deriving any advantage or emolument there from? A. If it is meant to ask me, whether I ever gave any direct authority to the paymaster to use the money in the manner above-mentioned, I should certainly answer no; but I have no hesitation in saying, that I believed, and understood he did, and never prohibited him from doing so; and I believe it was so understood by others at different times, when the establishment of the navy pay office was under consideration, when certainly no competent provision was made for the person exercising that trust of great extent and responsibility.&#x2014;Q. As the money applicable to naval services was directed to be lodged in the Bank by the act of 25th G. III. c. 31. and not to be drawn from thence without specifying the services for which it is drawn, by what authority did
<image src="S1V0003P0I0609"/>
<col>1189</col>
you give permission to the paymaster of the navy to; draw the money out of the Bank, and lodge it in the hands of private bankers? A. I take it for granted it always was drawn under the heads of service pointed out in the act of parliament; and when I talk of permission, I mean it under the explanation contained in answer to a former question, in which I suppose the money drawn under competent authority.&#x2014;Q. Do you know of any instance of a treasurer of the navy having made good any loss which had arisen from overpayments, or other misapplications of the public money? A. No, I do not.&#x2014;Q. Did you derive any profit or advantage from the use or employment of money issued for carrying on the current service of the navy, between 19th Aug. 1782 and 30th April 1783, or between 1st Feb. 1784 and 31st Dec. 1785, during which periods you held the offie of treasurer of the navy? A. I decline answering this question, under the 5th clause of the act 43d G. III. c. 16, and for the reasons given in my first answer.&#x2014;Q. Did you consider the addition granted by the King's sign manual, upon your appointment to the office of treasurer of the navy, making your salary 4,000l. a year, clear of all deductions, to be in full satisfaction for all wages, fees, and other profits and emoluments, previously enjoyed by former treasurers? A. Certainly I did, with the exception of coals, candles, and some such small contingencies,&#x2014;Q. When was it first discovered that Mr. Jellicoe was deficient in the balance of public money with which he stood charged, as deputy paymaster of the navy? A. I do not recollect the precise period; but the first thing that gave me any suspicion that there was a danger of deficiency, was, by observing in the reports occasionally made to me, that his balance remained stationary, so far at least as never to get below a sum, I think, of between 20 and 30,000l.; this led me to have a particular conversation with him, when he confessed to me, that for a considerable number of years he had been embarrassed from some advance or engagements lie had come under with a Mr. Cort; that from the high opinion I had of him, in consequence of the character of former treasurers of the navy, and my own observation, I had no reason to doubt the fidelity of his representation; and it was my belief, that if he had lived to superintend the business himself, and to
<col>1190</col>
bring the profits of the patent Mr. Cort had obtained to their proper bearing, that the loss might have been repaired. Upon this, however, I do not pretend to give any positive opinion, as it appeared alter his death that his embarrassment had existed, and a balance become due at least as early as 1782.&#x2014;Q. How many years before the death of Mr. Jellicoe was it that you suspected he was deficient in his balance? A. I cannot mention the precise time, but it was certainly more than one or two years.&#x2014;Q. Was any enquiry made, upon the discovery, into the real state of his balance? A. Certainly, it was minutely enquired into.&#x2014;Q. Does it any where appear what was the exact state of his deficiency at that time? A.I cannot state it from memory, but I dare say it does appear.

Does the paymaster act as deputy to the treasurer of the navy in all the duties attached to the situation? A. He does, except in the appointment of officers, and clerks.&#x2014;Q. By what authority does he so act? A. Under a general power of attorney.&#x2014;Q. What is the salary of paymaster? A. At present 800l. per annum.&#x2014;Q. When was it increased to that sum? A, About 3 or 4 years ago, to the best of my remembrance.&#x2014;Q. Does the paymaster: of the navy pay or disburse any money on the public account? A. No.&#x2014;Q. Has it been usual for him so to do? A. Not within my recollection, excepting in the payment of exchequer fees, which I till within this few years was in the habit of disbursing myself.&#x2014;Q.

<col>1191</col>
tice of the paymasters drawing the money out of the Bank, and lodging it in the hands of private bankers, first obtain? A. About 1787, as well as I can recollect (<i>a</i>)&#x2014;Q. Previous to that time were the drafts upon the Bank, for the money necessary for the several departments, invariably given to the sub-accountants, and the money received by them? A. Generally, though not invariably.&#x2014;Q. In the instances where the drafts were not given to the sub-accountants, to whom were the drafts given, and by whom was the money received at the Bank? A. To messengers and others employed in transacting that part of the business of the pay office.&#x2014;Q. To whom did the messenger and others employed to receive the money, in the instances where the drafts were not given to the sub-accountants, pay over such money? A. To myself, to the best of my recollection.&#x2014;Q. For what purpose was the money so paid over to you? A. To keep in my own hands until it should be required to be re-issued.&#x2014;Q. What sums did you usually so keep in your own hands? A. That I cannot recollect.&#x2014;Q. Did you derive any advantage from the money which you so kept in your own hands? A. I object to that question on the same grounds I have done before.&#x2014;Q. When the practice of drawing the money out of the Bank and lodging it in the hands of private bankers first obtained, was it done with the knowledge and approbation of the treasurer of the navy? A. It was.&#x2014;Q. In what manner was that approbation conveyed to you? A. Verbally in consequence of conversation which I bad with the treasurer at that time, in which I represented to him that I thought it would better expedite the public service, and add to the security of the treasurer, by leaving the drafts in the bankers hands to be placed to the credit of the accounts of the sub-accountants, by which the treasurer would avoid a considerable risk in the necessity which at that time existed of sending into the bank checques, which were necessarily drawn payable to the bearer, by the hands of common messengers, who were at that time employed in carrying in such checques and almost daily in bringing out large sums of specie, which they received at the Bank in payment of those checques; and in adopting this mode, I conceived the bankers became responsible for the amount of the drafts so lodged in their hands.&#x2014;Q. If the
<col>1192</col>
checques had been delivered to the cashiers of the navy and victualling, and the deputy paymaster, as the money became necessary for their several departments, would not the responsibility have rested with such sub accountants, and not with the treasurer of the navy? A. I apprehend it would, in so far as their private fortunes could indemnify the treasurer of the navy in case of any accident befalling the drafts so put into their hands; but as I apprehend the treasurer must ultimately have been responsible for such a loss, I looked upon it as my duty to advise him as I have stated.&#x2014;Q. Had any loss been sustained by the former practice in the receipt of the money? A. I never heard that there had been any loss occasioned by any such accident.&#x2014;Q. Have the treasurers of the navy ever been called upon to make good the losses which may have been sustained by the failure of their sub-accountants? A. I do not remember that they ever have been.&#x2014;Q. Were the same persons employed to convey the money from the private bankers as had previously been employed to obtain it from the Bank? A. Frequently, but as the distance was so much less to the house of Messrs. Coutts, than it had been to the Bank, the cashier of the navy has been in the habit of sending his principal clerk for the specie which lie required to carry on the public payments.&#x2014;Q. Did the additional security which you proposed to the treasurer of the navy, consist only in carrying the specie from the house of Messrs. Coutts to the pay office, instead of from the Hank? A. I apprehend it likewise consisted in providing against the loss which would have attended the circumstance of a messenger either embezzling or losing any of the drafts, which being made payable to bearer, I have been told by the cashiers of the Bank, must and would undoubtedly have been paid to any stranger presenting the same.&#x2014;Q. Would there not be the same risk of loss and embezzlement by sending for the money from the private bankers as from the bank? A. The same danger would exist in so far as respects the sum of money sent for by the office, but the risk was obviated of losing the whole amount of the checque, by the paymasters filling up the draft upon the Bank at the bankers, and leaving it in their hands, and a small part only of the draft was required in specie to carry on the payments, as the cashier of the navy was in the habit of making his principal payments

Was the practice of drawing the money out of the Bank and lodging it in. the bands of private bankers, pursued with the knowledge and approbation of the succeeding Treasurers? A. It was. (<i>b.</i>)&#x2014;Q. In what manner were they informed of it? A. I do not know by what means they were, informed of this mode of carrying on that part of the business of their office; but I am sensible that both of the succeeding treasurers were not unacquainted with the circumstance.&#x2014;Q. From what circumstances do you know that both the succeeding treasurers were informed of it? A. From having had conversation with them respectively on the subject.&#x2014;Q. What is the date of Mr. Bragge's order for putting a stop to that practice? A. I. do not remember.&#x2014;Q. Was it a written or a verbal order? A. The orders were verbal.&#x2014;Q. By whose order were the cashiers of the navy and victualling, and the deputy paymaster of the navy, directed to open accounts with Messrs. Coutts? A. I do not know that they had any orders respecting such circumstance, although I may have expressed my wishes to them that they should keep their balances at the house of Messrs. Courts.&#x2014;Q. Did the drawing of the money out of the Bank, and lodging. it in; the hands of Messrs. Coutts, offer any facility or advantage to the publice service, which might or could not be obtained by continuing the money at the Bank until wanted far the public service? A. I do not immediately apprehend any further advantage that could be obtained than those which I have already described.&#x2014;Q. Was the money received from the Bank at the house of Messrs. Coutts for the services of the sub-accountants placed immediately to their respective accounts, or first to your name, and only made over to their accounts by draft, as occasion required? A. Both modes were practised.&#x2014;Q. Do you know of any person or, persons (the paymaster of the navy out of the question) who have derived an advantage, from drawing the money out of the Bank and lodging it in the hands pf private bankers, or from applying to private use the money issued out of the exchequer for the service of the navy, since the year.1784? &#x2014;A. (<i>c.</i>) No, I do not, to the best of my knowledje.&#x2014;Q. Are the applications made

Are accounts opened at the Bank in the names of the cashiers of the navy and victualling, and the deputy paymaster, or with their respective branches?&#x2014;A. Yes, there are accounts opened for them in their respective names.&#x2014;Q. What is the usual mode of directing the money to be transferred at the bank to the names of the different sub-accountants?&#x2014;A. By an order to that purpose upon the Cashiers of the Bank.

It so far relates to myself, that it is possible I might be implicated in the answer.&#x2014;Q. Do you object to answer the preceding question because it may criminate, or tend to criminate you, or to expose you to any pains or penalties? A. I do, in so far as it may repose irregularities in the mode of my transacting the business of the pay office, which, in many instances, were unavoidable, during the long period in which it was under my management.&#x2014;Q.The question to which you have objected does not relate to irregularities in the mode of your transacting the business of the pay office, but calls upon you to state, whether you know any person or persons (the paymaster of the navy out of the question) who have derived any advantage from monies or bills issued out of the exchequer for naval services; you are desired to give a direct answer to that question, or to slate whether you object to it because it way criminate, or tend to criminate you, or to expose you to any pains or penalties A.

<p id="S1V0003P0-01892"><i>Written Paper delivered in by Mr. Trotter on the 25th July,</i> 1804. As many of the questions you have thought proper to ask me appear to me to be intended to enable you to judge, whether, in consequence of my having been supposed to derive advantages from the use of money in my hands, the public have ever suffered any loss, or experienced any inconvenience by delay of interruption in the payments which have been made under my direction, I must beg leave to state the following circumstances:&#x2014;In the first place, I desire to state, in the most explicit terms, that the amount of money issued from the Exchequer, or otherwise, paid to the treasurer of the navy, did not depend upon me, nor
<col>1198</col>
upon the treasurer, whom I represented: (With the exception, as I have stated in a former part of my evidence, of the money destined to pay exchequer fees, which is issued in sums of 300Ol. at a time, at the request of the paymaster, when the sum in band is reduced below 3,0001.; but the management of this small fund has, since the year 1800, been entrusted to the care of the officer appointed to manage the business at the Exchequer.) That it was not in nay power to increase or diminish the sum under my care by one farthing, such amount being determined exclusively by the Navy, Victualling, Sick and Hurt, and; Transport Boards, who respectively fix the amount from their own views of its necessity.&#x2014;In the next place, I state with equal precision, that of a sum exceeding one hundred and thirty four millions, which, under the regulation of the act (23th G. III. c. 31.) directing the money to be issued to the Bank, was put under my direction, commencing with my appointment to the office in 1786, and ending with my resignation of the office of paymaster last year, not one penny (except a sum of 605l. which I have stated to the Navy Board as an official error) remains in my possession, or in that of any of my principals; nor is the payment of all that sum has there even been the least delay or loss (Note. I consider the loss which government sustained by the failure of Mr. Jellicoe to have actually taken place prior to 1782, as appear by a declaration of his embarrassments at that period dated in that year) or interruption, every demand having been satisfied, and the balance which remained having been paid over to my successor.&#x2014;With regard to the mode in which this has been done; I feel myself equally free of blame. In the year 1785 an act (25 G. III. c. 31.) of parliament passed, directing, that all issues to the treasurer of the navy from the exchequer should be placed to his credit at the Bank of England, and be drawn from thence by drafts, specifying the beads of service for which it was wanted. These directions have accordingly been invariably followed; but to make every individual payment of each department of an extensive office by such drafts could never be the intention of the act, nor were such payments ever attempted to be so made either by me or by my predecessor or successor in office; accordingly, sums were drawn by me from the Bank in gross to form, funds for the satisfaction of such

<col>1199</col>
payments, of the amount of which, I, as representing the treasurer, was left exclusively to judge. While the office continued in Broad Street, and was consequently near the Bank, such balances under my care were comparatively less. When it was removed to Somerset Place, and both the risk of carriage and the inconvenience of sending for supplies became greater, the sums under my care were of course augmented, and then, as well as for security and accuracy, as to facilitate my payments, I had recourse to the assistance of a private banker, for which I had previously the express approbation of the treasurer then in office, and which I do not consider as the least departure from the letter or spirit of the above act.&#x2014;As the aggregate of balances under the charge of the treasurer of the navy, will, upon a review, appear very large, it must be recollected, that he acts as banker to four great public departments (the Navy Board, Victualling Board, Sick and Hurt Board, and Transport Board,) who pass their accounts separately, and have no connexion with each other, and who from experience, find the mode of keeping the several beads of service distinct the most convenient; but whether the aggregate be great or small, I repeat, was no care of mine. My duty was to have a sufficiency of these funds, at every moment, in such a shape as to satisfy every authorised demand; and in the execution of this duty, I claim merit in having so fulfilled it, that every claimant was not only paid without hesitation or interruption, but in the way most convenient to himself.&#x2014;The end of public satisfaction having been thus attained, and admitted by those who have had connexions with the office, by the Boards who have controlled it, and by the officers and clerks who have acted under me, I cannot conceive it will be imputed to me as a fault that in the management of sums which, in case of any accident having happened, were of a magnitude to have overwhelmed me, I have consulted my own safety and that of the public, in lesser arrangements, by keeping considerable sums in my own bauds and. in those of a private banker, which lessened the frequent risk attending the carrying the drafts to the Bank, and obtained me greater facilities in checking my accounts. No negative is put upon my making such arrangement by the only act (25 G. III. c. 31.) that bears upon the
<col>1200</col>
subject, and to these, perhaps, is principally owing the exemption from any error or delay in the whole of my public duty.&#x2014;But it is now unnecessary to dwell upon the merits of the mode I followed in the former part of my paymastership, as, in the latter part of it, the mode now adopted was introduced; and from that period till the present moment, no money has been in my bands for the purpose of preparatory supply of funds to the cashiers and paymasters.&#x2014;It is no doubt generally presumed, that advantages are derived from the use of public money by those in whose hands it lies. I have myself no doubt, though I cannot prove it, that such advantages were enjoyed by my predecessors. It is evident, from what I have stated, that they might have been enjoyed by them with honour and with safety to the public; and the exceeding smallness of the salary of paymaster, when compared with the immense extent of the trust and responsibility reposed in him, and with the complete devotion of his whole time to the service of the public, afford a presumption that such advantages have been considered as forming a part of the remuneration of so anxious and confidential a charge; at the same time, I by no means pretend to assert, that the issue of such advantages can be shewn to be any where distinctly recognized and sanctioned by law.&#x2014;Under these circumstances alone it is, that being kept in ignorance of the views with which this investigation is conducted, I feel myself bound, in consideration of my own personal safety, to make no admission whatever upon the subject.&#x2014;After this explanation, I beg leave to bring the whole subject into a short and connected statement, and to illustrate it with the figures which relate to the transactions of my pay mastership.&#x2014;I affirm, 1st, That I have never had it in my power, from the nature of my appointment, to augment the balances of the treasurer of the navy, or to create unnecessary balances in his hands. 2d, That no payments, in reduction of his balances, can be made by the treasurer of the navy, but under the direction of the Boards. 3d, That every payment which the Boards have directed the treasurer to make, during the period of my being in office, has actually been made by him without the smallest interruption, hesitation, or delay, and that the balance remaining in my hands was left with the treasurer at the time I left the office,

4th, That there had been imprested into the hands of the treasurer of the navy, and into the Bank upon his account, between the 31st Dec. 1785, and the 31st July 1803,the sum of l34,l69,253l. 14s. 11&#x00BE;d. That accounts have been delivered into the several Boards, shewing disbursements for the same period, amounting to 133,606,9841. 12s. 10&#x00BE;d. Balance 562,2491.2s. 1d. 5th, That no loss has accrued upon the numerous payments attending such disbursements, excepting in the sum of 4621. 15s. 6d. being the amount of sums due to seamen whose wages had been fraudulently obtained by others personating them, and trifling sums arising from errors in the calculation of seamen's wages. 6th, That as I have already stated, I left the aforesaid balance, 562,2491. 2s. 1d. of the current account of the treasurer of the navy, when I retired from office upon the said 31st July, 1803. The whole of the above statements can be checked and verified by a reference to the public accounts of the office, which possessing internal evidence of the facts, I do not think it would have been necessary for gentlemen acting under the present commission to have looked for ulterior evidence of the management of money which has not even been alleged to be deficient, at the painful expense of an exposure of ray private concerns, obtained through the means of my most confidential friends; and, I trust, that no hesitation which I may have shewn upon the former part of my evidence may be considered as an admission of having acted improperly, but entirely as proceeding from the caution that every man ought to observe under circumstances which might eventually expose him to pains and penalties not apprehended in the course of business, bat a consequence certainly necessary to be guarded against at this time, from my ignorance of the motive which has led to an investigation of my public conduct so strict and unexpected, extending even to evidence drawn from my banker, of my private transactions, which I do not consider to be authorised by your act of parliament (43 G. III c. 16): and I take this opportunity of protesting against any information, thus obtained upon transactions hot connected with any of the public departments specified in the above act, and more especially from persons imperfectly informed, who can only speak on belief or conjecture as to their nature.</p>

I understood that had been the practice in the office when I came to it, and it continued to be so during the whole time which I remained in office. Some time elapsed be. fore my attention was particularly drawn to it; when I had an opportunity of raking it into consideration, it appeared to me that this practice, whether authorised or not by the letter of the act, was not consistent with the spirit of it; and having lately left an office of a similar nature (that of the paymaster of the army) in which the regulations of Mr. Burke's Bill, which applied to the manner of drawing money from the Bank, had been complied with, without any complaint of inconvenience, I was desirous of putting the office which I then held upon the same footing. It was represented that considerable inconveni-
<image src="S1V0003P0I0616"/>
<col>1203</col>
ences would arise in the detail from this change; I desired to have a statement of them in writing, in order to make such enquiries as might enable me to form a judgment as to the validity of those objections. Amongst other circumstances, I was led to suppose that the change of sys tem might be found inconvenient to the Bank; in consequence I saw the govr. and dep. govr., and Mr. Newland, at the Bank, and examined the books both of the treasurer of the navy, and the paymaster of the army; I was satisfied, from the conversation with those gent., that no difficulty would arise on the part of the Bank in consequence of any additional trouble Which this change of system would give them. I had nearly completed the necessary enquiries in my own office, to satisfy my mind that the difficulties and inconveniences which might arise in the detail of the business from this change were not sufficient to alter the opinion I had formed, when I was prevented by a severe illness from attending further to the business of the office. I have stated this in general terms, and from a recollection which the distance of time that has elapsed renders very imperfect.&#x2014;Did you during your treasurership, direct any suns of money applicable to naval services to be applied HI any other way? Not as far as I recollect.&#x2014;Did the directors of the Bank offer to send the money wanted for naval serviced to the different sub-accountants, in order to prevent the possible loss by sending money by the porters, messengers; &amp;c. belonging to the Pay Office? I do not recollect such an offer.&#x2014;Did yon or any other person, to your knowledge, derive any advantage from the use of money applicable to naval services, during the time you was treasurer of the navy?

George Canning, Treasurer of the Navy, to the Commissioners of Navel Enquiry, dated Navy Pay Office, 3d Oct.</i> 1804.&#x2014;Gentlemen, In answer to your letter of yesterday, I have the honour to inform you, that the delay in making returns to your several precepts of the 10th and 17th July, has proceeded from the circumstance of representations having been made to me of the extreme difficulty and hinderance to the current business of the office which must attend the making out account of so complicated a nature, in forms so wholly unusual and unknown to the practice of this department. Upon these representations I thought it my duty to found a question to be submitted to the Attorney and Solicitor General to whom I subsequently thought proper to join Mr. Jervis, counsel to the admiralty, and the framer (as I have
<col>1212</col>
understood) of the act by which your commission is constituted, "whether, under the words of the act, I was compellable to furnish the accounts called for in the unusual form prescribed by the precepts, or whether I should not fully satisfy the act,, by producing to you any or all of the accounts of the office in the shape in which they now exist?" I have the honour to inclose to you a copy of the opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor General, and Mr. Jervis, on this question, which I received on the 27th of last month. Whether I shall act upon it in strictness will depend upon the result of a more minute and particular statement, which I have directed to be made to me by those gentlemen in the different departments of this office, who would be occupied in preparing the returns to your precepts, of the time that would take, and the extraordinary assistance that would be required to prepare them, without interruption to the current business of the office. If on the best judgment that I can form from the reports of the gentlemen to whom I have referred, the interruption should appear likely to be immaterial, I should still have great satisfaction in complying, even though the letter of the act of parliament does not enjoin compliance, with the forms which you have devised. In the other case, I must act upon the; opinion which I have receded from the law officers of the crown; and I hope, in the course of a few days, to let you know the decision, which I find myself enabled to form upon this alternative. I am, &amp;c.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01962" align="right">G. CANNING.</p>
<p id="S1V0003P0-01963">We are of opinion, that the Treasurer of the Navy will satisfy the words of the Act of the 43d G. III. c. 16. by producing to the Commissioners of Naval inquiry the Accounts of his office in the shape in which they now exist; and that if the labour and the time it would require to make them out in the manner called for by the Commissioners of Enquiry, are such as to occasion any material obstruction to the business of his department, we, think the production of them in their present shape is all that can be reasonably expected of him.</p>
